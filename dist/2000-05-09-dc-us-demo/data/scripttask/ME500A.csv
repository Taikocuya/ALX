"","\h(《Aika》)This is an air ship battle, Vyse!
The next screen that you will see is a 3x3 grid.\e"
"",\h(《Aika》)Every turn is broken down into 3 separatephases.\e
"","\h(《Aika》)Just command all 3 of us during the 3 phases 
andeverything should be fine!\c"
"","\h(《Aika》)The Main Gun is powerful, but it can only fire
one cannon ball at a time.\e"
"","\h(《Aika》)On the other hand, the Secondary Gun doesn't do
as much damage, but it can fire several times
over the 3 phases of a turn.\e"
"","\h(《Aika》)Torpedoes, although they miss a lot, can be
aimed at a specific area on the map… and can
even hit an area at the same time a cannon does!\e"
"","\h(《Aika》)Oh yeah… and one more thing.
When you fire any of your cannons, it uses up
Spirit, so be careful.\c"
"","\h(《Fina》)There's a breach in the hull!
Vyse, it's dangerous if we continue on like
this!\e"
"",\h(《What will you do?》)
"","“Maybe it is a little dangerous…”
“It's only a scratch…”\e"
"","\h(《Vyse》)Looks like we're in trouble…
Is there anything we can do?\e"
"","\h(《Aika》)Actually, there is.
You can use the spell Sacri to make minor
repairs on the ship's hull.\c"
"","\h(《Vyse》)The ship can handle more than this!  There's
nothing to worry about…  We just have to bear
down and give it all we got!\e"
"","\h(《Aika》)Aye aye, captain!  But be careful.  If things
start to look bad, just use the spell “Sacri“
to repair the ship.\c"
"","\h(《Aika》)Alright, Vyse… it's time to end this once and
for all.
What's your next order?\e"

“Fly up next to it and see what happens…”\c"

"",\h(《What will you do?》)
"","“Get behind it!”
“Fly up next to it and see what happens…”\c"
"","\h(《Aika》)Aye aye, captain!\c"
"","\h(《the Blackbeard》)We are the Black Pirates!
Just because you're guests at E3 doesn't mean
you'll get away easy!  Prepare youselves!\c"
