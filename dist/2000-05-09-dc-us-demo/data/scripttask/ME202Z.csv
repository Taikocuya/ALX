MA0120000,\h(《Fina》)It's so beautiful… \e
MA0120001,"\h(《Vyse》)I come up here all the time just to watch 
the sunset and think. \e"
MA0120002,"\h(《Vyse》)I often wonder what lies beyond the sky…
beyond the sunset… \e"
MA0120003,\h(《Fina》)Beyond… the sky…? \e
MA0120004,"\h(《Vyse》)Some say that there's nothing but monsters.
Others say there's a waterfall and ships that 
gets too close falls off the edge of the world.\e"
MA0120005,"\h(《Vyse》)And there are others that say it's 
just impossible for humans to 
ever reach it… \e"
MA0120006,\h(《Fina》)… \e
MA0120007,"\h(《Vyse》)But, I want to know what's 
beyond this world… \e"
MA0120008,"\h(《Vyse》)Besides, I don't like 
to giving up on something 
without trying at least. \e"
MA0120009,"\h(《Vyse》)Someday, I'll be the captain 
of a great ship and I will go 
beyond that sunset. \e"
MA0120010,"\h(《Aika》)Wow… I bet the sky is beautiful 
beyond the sunset… \e"
MA0120011,\h(《Vyse・Aika》)Hey!! \e
MA0120012,\h(《Vyse》)…That was a Moon Stone! \e
MA0120013,\h(《Fina》)…a Moon Stone? \e
MA0120014,"\h(《Vyse》)…It landed on
that island… That's Shrine Island, I think. \e"
MA0120015,"\h(《Aika》)It's been a while since I've 
seen a Moon stone fall! \e"
MA0120016,"\h(《Fina》)Pardon me, but 
that shooting star was 
a Moon Stone? \e"
MA0120017,"\h(《Aika》)That's right.
Fina, you've  heard of 
Moon stones before, right? \e"
MA0120018,"\h(《Aika》)They are shooting stars that come 
from the moon. Great energy 
is locked inside of them. \e"
MA0120019,"\h(《Aika》)They are used for many things.  For instance, 
they power our air ships and are used as 
materials for our weapons.\e"
MA0120020,"\h(《Fina》)Oh, yes.
I know about Moon Stones. \e"
MA0120021,"\h(《Fina》)But… it's my first time actually seeing a 
Moon Stone fall from 
the sky. \e"
MA0120022,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, shall we go to Shrine Island tomorrow?
We should go get the Moon Stone 
as soon as possible.\e"
MA0120023,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, we should. \e"
MA0120024,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Vyse! Aika!
Miss Fina! \e"
MA0120025,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Dinner is ready. 
Come on down. \e"
MA0120026,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's go, Fina. 
You're gonna eat stay and eat with us, 
right Aika? \e"
MA0120027,"\h(《Aika》)We're so lucky! I love her
cooking! \e"
MA0120028,"\h(《Aika》)Fina, let's go eat while it's still hot! \e"
MA0120029,"\h(《Fina》)Yes.
