MB0010000,"\h(《Aika》)The visibility is poor!
Vyse, it's growing too foggy. \e"
MB0010001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's strange… there's never any 
fog in this region… \e"
MB0010002,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, the only way to get to Pirate Isle 
is to go straight through this area. 
Let's advance at half-speed. \e"
MB0010003,"\h(《Aika》)Wait a minute, Vyse.
Something's… there… \e"
MB0010004,"\h(《Vyse》)What, what is it?
Is it the Floating Island!? \e"
MB0010005,\h(《Aika》)Aaahh! \e
MB0010006,"\h(《Aika》)L- Look, Vyse! \e"
MB0010007,"\h(《Aika》)It… It isn't an island! 
It's alive! \e"
MB0010008,"\h(《Vyse》)What the…
It's a whale!! \e"
MB0010009,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
That's the biggest whale 
I've ever seen in my life! \e"
MB0010010,"\h(《Aika》)We will probably be knocked out of the sky 
if we get too close with this 
small ship… \e"
MB0010011,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, what should we do? \e"
MB0010012,"\h(《What should we do!?》)“Of course we’ll fight it” 
“Of course we’ll run away” 
“…Aika, what should we do?” \e"
MB0010013,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course we'll fight it. 
We can't just let it
sink our ship! \e"
MB0010014,"\h(《Aika》)Are you crazy? How are we going 
to beat it with this small ship? 
We don't even have a cannon! \e"
MB0010015,"\h(《Aika》)We must continue on to Valua without a 
moment's delay. We don't have 
time for this! \e"
MB0010016,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course we're going to run away. 
This little ship wouldn't stand a chance 
of holding together against that thing. \e"
MB0010017,"\h(《Vyse》)Our goal is to go to Valua.
We don't have time to deal 
with this monster. \e"
MB0010018,"\h(《Aika》)Okay. 
I can't argue with that 
decision. \e"
MB0010019,"\h(《Vyse》)…What should we do? 
Aika, do you have any good advice? \e"
MB0010020,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! 
Don't be so undependable! \e"
MB0010021,"\h(《Aika》)Well… we wouldn't stand a chance 
in this small ship, so I 
suggest we run away! \e"
MB0010022,\h(《Aika》)Aahh! \e
MB0010023,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse…
I can't hold on much longer! \e"
MB0010024,"\h(《Vyse》)Just grab onto something and hang tight! 
If you let go, you'll be 
blown off the ship! \e"
MB0010025,"\h(《Aika》)But…
The ship can't hold together much longer! \e"
MB0010026,\h(《Vyse・Aika》)Aaaahhhh!! \e
