MA0130007,"\h(《Fina》)Yes.
I'd love to go. \e"
MA0130008,"\h(《Aika》)Alright Vyse, let's get going. 
I've already prepared the boat on the
top wharf. \e"
MA0130009,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, Vyse.
I've already prepared the boat on the 
top wharf. \e"
MA0130010,"\h(《Vyse》)The top wharf?  Gotcha. 
Thanks! \e"
M00010000,"\h(《Boy》)Oh, hey Vyse!

M00010001,"\h(《Boy》)If you can find Pow and the
three of us, we'll tell you
a secret! \e"
M00010002,"\h(《Well…》)“Sure, let's play!”
“Maybe next time”\e"
M00010003,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… hide-and-seek?
Heh… sure, let's play! \e"
M00010004,"\h(《Boy》)Great!
Alright then… Vyse, you're it! \e"
M00010005,"\h(《Boy》)When we say “ready”, find the 
three of us and Pow!\c"
M00010017,\h(《Boy》)Ready!\c
M00010006,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry guys, I'm kinda busy…
I'll play next time. \e"
M00010007,"\h(《Boy》)Oh… that's alright.
We'll see you later then! \c"
M00010008,"\h(《Boy》)Oh, man! You found me!
Shucks! \e"
M00010009,"\h(《Boy》)But we still win if you don't find
everyone! \e"
M00010010,"\h(《Vyse》)Okay, I think that's everyone. \e"
M00010011,"\h(《Boy》)Aw man… you found everyone…
Well, a promise is a promise.
I guess we have to tell you the secret… \e"
M00010012,"\h(《Boy》)There's a mysterious statue on
a small island between “Forest
Island” and “Sand Island”. \e"
M00010013,"\h(《Boy》)I overheard my dad talking about it.
If you pass by it on your ship,
you should check it out! \c"
M00010014,"\h(《Boy》)We win if you don't find
everyone! \c"
M00010015,"\h(《Boy》)There's a mysterious statue on 
a small island between “Forest 
Island” and “Sand Island”. \e"
M00010016,"\h(《Boy》)I overheard my dad talking about it.
If you pass by it on your ship,
you should check it out! \c"
M00020000,"\h(《Boy》)Vyse, are you going to go look for
Moon Stones now? \e"
M00020001,"\h(《Boy》)You're so lucky that you get your own ship. 
When I grow up, I want to be a sailor, too! \c"
M00020002,"\h(《Boy》)You're so lucky that you get your own ship. 
When I grow up, I want to be a sailor, too! \c"
M00020003,"\h(《Boy》)Oh no. You found me.
I was hoping that you 
wouldn't find me here. \c"
M00020004,\h(《Boy》)Where are the others hiding? \c
M00020005,"\h(《Boy》)Oh, that was fun!
Let's play again! \c"
M00030000,"\h(《Girl》)Oh, Vyse! I was playing tag
with everyone and Pow just now! \e"
M00030001,"\h(《Girl》)Let's play together next time,
okay!?
Bye-bye! \c"
M00030002,"\h(《Girl》)Let's play together next time,
okay!? \c"
M00030003,"\h(《Girl》)Oh! You found me!
I should've hidden some place
else! \c"
M00030004,"\h(《Girl》)You haven't found everyone 
yet, right?
Good luck! \c"
M00030005,"\h(《Vyse》)Are you going to Shrine 
Island? Good luck! \c"
M00040000,\h(《Pow》)Pow-pow!\e
M00040001,"\h(《Vyse》)Pow, are you having fun with everyone?
Good for you.\e"
M00040002,\h(《Pow》)Po-w!\c
M00040003,\h(《Pow》)Pow-pow!\c
M00040004,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, Pow…
You were here.\e"
M00040005,\h(《Pow》)Pa-hew…\e
M00040006,"\h(《Vyse》)Pow, wait.
I'll find the others.\e"
M00040007,\h(《Pow》)Pow-pow. Po-w!\c
M00040008,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, Pow.
We'll play again.\e"
M00040009,\h(《Pow》)Pow-pow. Pow!\c
M00050000,"\h(《Woman》)Treasure chests have been filled with supplies 
around the island, in case of emergency.\e"
M00050001,"\h(《Woman》)There are 3 chests placed in various places 
around the village.  Why don't you look 
for them?\c"
M00050002,"\h(《Woman》)There are 3 chests placed in various places 
around the village.  Why don't you look for 
them?\c"
M00060000,"\h(《Woman》)Even the imperial troops don't
know this peaceful-looking island is
the HQ for the Air Pirates.\e"
M00060001,"\h(《Woman》)Air Pirate ships are hidden in
the underground port, so there
is no way they'll ever find out.\c"
M00070000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Oh, that Ben!
He locked the port door and just left! \e"
M00070001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Vyse, would you please go find Ben and bring me 
the key to the underground port?\c"
M00070002,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Great. You got the keys 
from Ben! \e"
M00070003,"\h(《Air Pirate》)You're a savior, Vyse!
Now I can go down to the
underground port! \c"
M00080000,"\h(《Mother》)Oh, no…
I forgot. I don't have any fish for 
dinner tonight. \e"
M00080001,"\h(《Mother》)Vyse, will you please go out
and catch 10 sky 
sardines? \c"
M00080002,\h(　)I handed over 10 “sky sardines”. \e
M00080003,"\h(《Mother》)You brought me 10 sky sardines?
Why, thank you Vyse. \e"
M00080004,"\h(《Mother》)Here… Take this with you.
Eat it later. \e"
M00080005,\h(　)I received one “Moon Berry”. \c
M00080006,"\h(《Mother》)We're having fried sky sardines
tonight.
Don't be out too late.\c"
M00090000,"\h(《Young Lady》)I think it's very important for everyone, 
including air pirates,to have a home to return 
to and rest their tired souls.\e"
M00090001,"\h(《Young Lady》)Nothing keeps you stronger
than knowing that there's a place to
return to and someone waiting there… \c"
M00100000,"\h(《Old Lady》)We're able to live the way we do thanks to 
the blessed moon. \e"
M00100001,"\h(《Old Lady》)It is because of the moon that our ships can 
float and we are able to build great fires. \e"
M00100002,"\h(《Old Lady》)It's a blessing.
It's a blessing. \c"
M00100003,"\h(《Old Lady》)It's a blessing.
It's a blessing. \c"
M00110000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Hey, Vyse!
Wanna learn a few 
things about fighting? \e"
M00110001,"\h(《Well…》)“Show me the ropes on fighting” 
“Tell me about weapons”
“No, it's okay” \e"
M00110002,"\h(《Vyse》)Well…
Could you show me the ropes on fighting? \e"
M00110003,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Sure!
The most important thing in a fight is 
how you use your “spirit”! \e"
M00110004,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Think of “spirit” as the 
energy used when performing 
a super move. \e"
M00110005,"\h(《Air Pirate》)In a battle, the entire 
party gathers their spirit 
as one in order to fight. \e"
M00110006,"\h(《Air Pirate》)That’s why each character can 
focus and build up their spirit.\e"
M00110007,"\h(《Air Pirate》)You can use their spirit to 
perform powerful “super moves”
and collaborated attacks! \e"
M00110008,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Oh, and one more thing… courage can't be 
used up.You gain courage at the beginning of 
every round.\e"
M00110009,"\h(《Air Pirate》)So, don't spare courage when
fighting. It's better to use a
lot of it. \c"
M00110010,"\h(《Vyse》)Tell me about weapons.
Aren’t our weapons made out of 
Moon Stones? \e"
M00110011,"\h(《Air Pirate》)That's right. Their attack 
properties depend on the 
color of the Moon Stone it was made from. \e"
M00110012,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Red Moon Stone weapons have the power of fire, 
and yellow, the power of thunder.\e"
M00110013,"\h(《Air Pirate》)If the colored weapons are 
used properly, you can cause 
extra damage to the enemy. \c"
M00110014,"\h(《Vyse》)No, it's okay.\e"
M00110015,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Okay then.
Well, they say best way is to 
learn anything is through experience. \c"
M00120000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)If “magic” and “super moves”
are used appropriately, winning
fights will be much easier. \e"
M00120001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)So, will you like to hear
more about “magic” and 
“super moves”? \e"
M00120002,"\h(《Well…》)“Teach me about magic” 
“Teach me about super moves” 
“I don’t need to hear about it” \e"
M00120003,"\h(《Vyse》)Teach me about “magic”. 
Is it actual magic? \e"
M00120004,"\h(《Air Pirate》)That’s right. The power of the 
magic that you can use depends on the 
how much “spirit” you have built up. \e"
M00120005,"\h(《Air Pirate》)You can’t go wrong by thinking
that magic using more
spirit is more powerful. \e"
M00120006,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Each time you use magic, 
your MP will decrease by 1
no matter what kind it is. \e"
M00120007,"\h(《Air Pirate》)MP will decrease when using magic 
regardless. So, you might as well use
as much spirit as you can…\e"
M00120008,"\h(《Air Pirate》)So, it's more advantageous to 
use a more powerful spell. \e"
M00120009,"\h(《Air Pirate》)There are 6 colors of magic.  Depending on the 
color of your weapon, you will learn the 
various colors of magic at different speeds. \e"
M00120010,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Change the weapon color to 
match the type of magic you want 
to learn more quickly. \c"
M00120011,"\h(《Vyse》)Teach me about “super moves”.
Are “super moves” sort of like
special attacks? \e"
M00120012,"\h(《Air Pirate》)That's right.  However, unlike magic, your 
super moves only use courage, Vyse.
No MP is needed.\e"
M00120014,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Since it is overwhelmingly 
powerful, you should use it 
when you need the extra “punch”. \e"
M00120015,"\h(《Air Pirate》)There are fruits with strange 
powers called “Moon Berries” 
in this world. \e"
M00120016,"\h(《Air Pirate》)By eating these “Moon Berries”
you can learn new techniques.
Find as many Moon Berries as you can! \c"
M00120017,"\h(《Vyse》)No, it's okay. \e"
M00120018,"\h(《Air Pirate》)What? That's disappointing. Well, 
don't hesitate to ask if you 
have any questions later. \c"
M01150000,"\h(《Owner of Temporary Shop》)Hi! This is your general store 
handling everything from 
medicine to weapons! \e"
M01150001,"\h(《Owner of Temporary Shop》)This really is Aika's house, 
but we opened a shop 
here just for this occasion! \e"
M00150000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Hey, Vyse!
Are you leaving for 
Shrine Island? \e"
M00150001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)To get to Shrine Island,
you need to take that boat behind me.\e"
M00150002,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Once in the sky, go straight to
the north. You will run into Shrine
Island soon enough! \c"
M00150003,"\h(《Air Pirate》)To get to Shrine Island,
you need to take that boat behind me. \e"
M00150004,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Once in the sky, go straight to
the north. You will run into Shrine
Island soon enough! \c"
M00190000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)This is Lookout Island. We 
work in shifts looking out for enemy
ships. \e"
M00190001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)It's tough to stand out here early in 
the morning because of the cold, but this is 
one of our duties as Air Pirates. \c"
M002a0000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a supply box for small 
boats. Looks like it's 
empty now. \c"
M002a0001,\h(《Vyse》)Oh look… a butterfly. \e
M002a0002,"\h(《Vyse》)That reminds me, I've heard of 
a migrating butterfly that 
lives somewhere in the world. \c"
M002a0003,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a bag of Moon stones. 
Looks like it's a supply to 
load on the ship. \c"
M002a0004,"\h(《Vyse》)In the underground port, 
baggage is raised and lowered 
using this windmill's power. \e"
M002a0005,"\h(《Vyse》)We can’t waste Moon stones. 
Wherever possible, power sources like 
windmills must be used. \c"
M002a0006,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a box of rifle bullets.
I only use swords, so it 
isn't necessary. \c"
M002a0007,"\h(《Vyse》)In the underground port, 
baggage is raised and lowered 
using this windmill's power. \e"
M002a0008,"\h(《Vyse》)We can’t waste Moon stones. 
Wherever possible, power sources like 
windmills must be used. \c"
M002a0009,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a well-used fireplace. 
Aika throws in gunpowder when 
it isn't lit. \c"
M002a0010,"\h(《Vyse》)Excuse me. No matter what, one
must not open a lady's 
dresser without permission. \e"
M002a0011,"\h(《Vyse》)Air pirates are gentlemen. 
We may steal treasure, but 
we do NOT steal ladies underwear… \c"
M002a0012,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, is this Aika's vanity?
I guess even she can be pretty feminine at 
times. \c"
M002a0013,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika's parents died when she 
was still little. \e"
M002a0014,"\h(《Vyse》)So, there's only one bed.
She tosses and turns in her 
sleep, so she has a big bed.\c"
M002a0015,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a Valuan shield we stole. 
Air pirates do not use shields, 
so it's just used for decor. \c"
M002a0016,"\h(《Vyse》)When you light the tip of the spear 
and throw it at your enemy's ship, it can 
cause a lot of damage.  It's a great weapon. \c"
M002a0017,"\h(《Vyse》)This pillar can be very useful in fights. 
Especially when a melee breaks out 
on deck in a small ship. \c"
M002a0018,"\h(《Vyse》)Even though I'm an air 
pirate, I would never steal 
from granny's chest… \c"
M002a0019,"\h(《Vyse》)This smell…
This has to be salted fish… \c"
M002a0020,"\h(《Vyse》)The bread that granny bakes in 
the fireplace is really
delicious. \e"
M002a0021,"\h(《Vyse》)She used to bake it often when 
Aika and I were little… \c"
M002a0022,"\h(《Vyse》)What's this…
Yuck, it's the cleaning solution
for her dentures! \c"
M002a0023,\h(《Vyse》)There is plenty of water in it. \c
M002a0024,"\h(《Vyse》)In the jar is…
pickled turnips. \c"
M002a0025,"\h(《Vyse》)A bandana and a striped shirt…
It's filled with clothing for 
air pirates. \c"
M002a0026,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a big fireplace.
It even has a stand to place
a pot. \c"
M002a0027,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a water jar.
Looks like it's used for 
cooking. \c"
M002a0028,"\h(《Vyse》)It's filled with tableware. 
There is even some kids' tableware too. \c"
M002a0029,"\h(《Vyse》)After returning from sailing, 
the most relaxing moment is 
when one gets into his bed. \c"
M002a0030,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a map of the airspace in 
this area. Also, it's a map of 
the turf of the Dyne Family. \c"
M002a0031,"\h(《Vyse》)My old man sails a lot, so 
this bed isn't used very 
much. \c"
M002a0032,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the fireplace that 
Mother lights daily. \c"
M002a0033,"\h(《Vyse》)The silver plate that Mother bought
when she got married is still 
preciously kept here. \c"
M002a0034,"\h(《Vyse》)It's my bed, but…
I sail a lot, so I only use it 6 
months out of the year. \c"
M002a0035,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a book that was stolen. 
Books are valuables that we 
can only rarely obtain. \e"
M002a0036,"\h(《Vyse》)I once read a book on the art of 
navigation over and over 
again until the bindings were all worn out…\c"
M002a0037,"\h(《Vyse》)Oops… The papers I was using when 
I was studying about stars are 
scattered about. \e"
M002a0038,"\h(《Vyse》)To know where you are, sailors 
must know all about stars. \c"
M002a0039,"\h(《Vyse》)It says “Windmill Island”. 
This island is marked on every 
map with the same name too. \e"
M002a0040,"\h(《Vyse》)But, it’s really only a cover name. It is
actually the HQ of the Dyne 
Family, “Pirate Isle”. \c"
M002a0041,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the island's valuable 
well. One time, Aika fell into it a long 
time ago and caused a huge commotion. \c"
M002a0042,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the box the women often come out 
and sit on when resting after drawing water. \c"
M002a0043,"\h(《Vyse》)You could never tell from the way 
Aika swings her boomerang that she 
has the tenderness to raise such flowers…\e"
M002a0044,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika even surprises 
me sometimes. \c"
M002a0045,"\h(《Vyse》)It's always breezy on this 
island so the laundry 
dries easily. \c"
M002a0046,"\h(《Vyse》)It's always breezy on this 
island so the laundry 
dries easily. \c"
M002a0047,"\h(《Vyse》)Isn't this the laundry tub? 
Who left it out here? \c"
M002a0048,"\h(《Vyse》)…Vegetables are an important 
source of nutrients for sailors.
Everyone raises them with care \c"
M002a0049,"\h(《Vyse》)Is this the incinerator? 
Looks like it's connected to 
the fireplace inside. \c"
M002a0050,"\h(《Vyse》)It's easy to get scurvy when you're sailing… 
there just aren't enough vegetables around.  
That's why turnips are so important to us. \e"
M002a0051,"\h(《Vyse》)But, we have pickled turnips 
day after day when sailing… 
I can't stand them anymore… \c"
M002a0052,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a secret path to the 
underground port behind this. 
It can't be opened from above ground. \c"
M002a0053,\h(《Vyse》)It's locked… \c
