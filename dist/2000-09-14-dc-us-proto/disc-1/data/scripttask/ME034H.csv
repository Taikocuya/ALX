Ms034b000,"\h(《Vyse》)There are all sorts of emergency supplies in
this box. Even on a ship as powerful as the
Delphinus, emergencies do happen, I suppose.\c"
Ms034b100,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube, just like the ones we used
on the Albatross. This one is probably connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b101,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey Vyse, this is Gilder from the bridge.
Where are you at?\c"
Ms034b001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b002,"\h(《Fina》)This is the bridge, over…
Oh… Vyse, it's you. Are you enjoying the
view from the lookout tower?\c"
Ms034b003,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b004,"\h(《Fina》)Bridge, here! Vyse, what are you doing!!
The ship is badly damaged! You need to
do something about it!!\c"
Ms034b015,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't have time to go to the lookout
tower! We're under attack! I need to get
out on deck!\c"
Ms034b005,"\h(《Vyse》)Thanks to this searchlight, we can fly
safely, even at night.\c"
Ms034b006,"\h(《Vyse》)There are all sorts of emergency supplies in
this box. Even on a ship as powerful as the
Delphinus, emergencies do happen, I suppose.\c"
Ms034b007,"\h(《Vyse》)Weapons need to be constantly maintained.
Otherwise, anything metal starts to rust and
anything leather starts to rot…\c"
Ms034b106,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b107,"\h(《Aika》)This is the bridge, over…
Oh… It's you. Quit playing around and get
back up here, Vyse!!!\c"
Ms034b008,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b009,"\h(《Aika》)This is the bridge!!
Vyse?! What are you doing there! Hurry
up and fix this ship!!\c"
Ms034b010,"\h(《Vyse》)I suppose this is the best place to hang
laundry. It dries the fastest out here, even
though it doesn't look very nice.\c"
Ms034b011,"\h(《Vyse》)Since this ship has such a nice kitchen, the
crew can eat home-cooked meals, even way up
here in the sky.\c"
Ms034b012,"\h(《Vyse》)The ship's pretty badly damaged. I better
hurry up and fix her… If we get into another
battle like this, we're finished.\c"
Ms034b013,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like Muraji's locked this door. Who's
ship does he think this is, anyway?!\c"
Ms034b014,"\h(《Vyse》)The door's locked. I should make my way to the
bridge, anyway… That's where Muraji is!\c"
Ms034a020,"\h(《Vyse》)It's too dangerous to go outside in this
place. I should leave these doors closed
and locked.\c"
M00040000,"\h(《Pow》)Pow pow pow pow pow!
Pow pow pow pow!\c"
M14110000,\h(《Marco》)Damn! Damn! This fire just won't go out!!\e
M05030000,"\h(《Merida》)Hot hot hot!
Captain, hurry! The ship needs repairs! We're 
going to crash!!!\c"
M05210000,"\h(《Tikatika》)Hmm… The ship is on fire. I think it would
probably be good to fix the ship. I don't think
it is good for the ship to be on fire.\c"
M06330000,"\h(《Khazim》)Don't just stand there gawking!
Hurry up and put the fire out!
We'll crash if you don't hurry!\e"
M06330001,\h(《Khazim's Men》)Yessir! Right away sir!\c
M06340000,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)C'mon!
Fire, just go out already!
Ouch! Hot hot hot!\c"
M06350000,\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)Hah! I'm not going to quit now!\c
M08150000,"\h(《Kirala》)I can do some emergency repairs to seal up some
of the holes in the hull, but the ship's in need
of more than that, Captain!\c"
M14010000,"\h(《Izmael》)The damage is too great for these makeshift 
repairs to do any good!\e"
M14010001,"\h(《Izmael》)If we don't take some drastic measures soon, 
this ship is finished!\c"
M14020000,"\h(《Belle》)Take that! And that! Oh, go out already!!! Why 
won't these fires just go out!?!\c"
M14090000,"\h(《Lilly》)Ahh! Captain! Do something will ya?! The ship is
gonna crash!!\c"
M14100000,"\h(《Nara》)\ecough, cough\e It's too hot! I, I can't getclose enough! Captain, do something!!\c"
M14050000,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey hey… Vyse!
Your ship is on fire. Don't you think you should
do something about all this?\c"
Mp0040000,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, if we continue fighting much longer in 
this state, we will surely die.\c"
Mp0040001,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, if we continue fighting much longer in 
this state, we will surely die.\c"
Mp0040002,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, let me go with you. Let me fight by 
your side.\e"
Mp0040003,"\h(《Will you take Enrique with you?》)“Of course.”
“Sorry, I need you to stay here.”\e"
Mp0040004,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course, Enrique.
C'mon, I need you to help me defeat Ramirez.\e"
Mp0040005,"\h(《Enrique》)Thank you, Vyse!
I will fight to the best of my abilities. 
I will not let you down.\e"
Mp0040006,\h(　)Enrique has joined your party.\c
Mp0040007,"\h(《Enrique》)Oh… I see. Well, if you change your mind, just 
let me know. I'm always ready to fight.\c"
Mp0030000,"\h(《Drachma》)Vyse, your ship has taken too much damage. You
must do somethin' to fix the ship or else we're
finished.\c"
Mp0030001,"\h(《Drachma》)You're goin' to go into that island, boy? You're
crazier than I thought…\e"
Mp0030002,"\h(《Drachma》)… But if you insist on goin', I can't let you 
go alone.\e"
Mp0030003,"\h(《Will you take Drachma with you?》)“C'mon, Captain!”
“Sorry, but I need you to stay here.”\e"
Mp0030004,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm counting on you, Captain!
With your experience, and that arm of yours,
Ramirez doesn't stand a chance!\e"
Mp0030005,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrmph… I can't believe I'm fightin' with you 
again…\e"
Mp0030006,\h(　)Drachma has joined your party.\c
Mp0030007,"\h(《Drachma》)I see.
I don't like it, but if you change your mind, 
let me know.\c"
Mp0050000,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, Vyse.
Um… the ship's looking a little… bad.
Maybe you should fix it or something…\c"
Mp0050001,"\h(《Gilder》)I know we're close to ending this thing, but 
don't you think you should at least fix your 
ship first?\c"
Mp0050002,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, Vyse. This sounds like fun. Count me in.\e"
Mp0050003,"\h(《Will you take Gilder with you?》)“Of course, who else would I take?”
“Sorry, but I need you to stay here.”\e"
Mp0050004,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course, who else would I take?
I need you to help me defeat Ramirez!\e"
Mp0050005,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh… I figured as much. Looks like it's finally
time to get a little serious.\e"
Mp0050006,\h(　)Gilder has joined the party.\c
Mp0050007,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, don't get my hopes up like that. If you
change your mind, I'll be right here. Besides, I
don't really have anything better to do.\c"
