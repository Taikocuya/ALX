Ms034b000,"\h(《Vyse》)There are all sorts of emergency supplies in
this box. Even on a ship as powerful as the
Delphinus, emergencies do happen, I suppose.\c"
Ms034b100,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube, just like the ones we used
on the Albatross. This one is probably connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b101,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey Vyse, this is Gilder from the bridge.
Where are you at?\c"
Ms034b001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b002,"\h(《Fina》)This is the bridge, over…
Oh… Vyse, it's you. Are you enjoying the
view from the lookout tower?\c"
Ms034b003,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b004,"\h(《Fina》)Bridge, here! Vyse, what are you doing!!
The ship is badly damaged! You need to
do something about it!!\c"
Ms034b015,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't have time to go to the lookout
tower! We're under attack! I need to get
out on deck!\c"
Ms034b005,"\h(《Vyse》)Thanks to this searchlight, we can fly
safely, even at night.\c"
Ms034b006,"\h(《Vyse》)There are all sorts of emergency supplies in
this box. Even on a ship as powerful as the
Delphinus, emergencies do happen, I suppose.\c"
Ms034b007,"\h(《Vyse》)Weapons need to be constantly maintained.
Otherwise, anything metal starts to rust and
anything leather starts to rot…\c"
Ms034b106,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b107,"\h(《Aika》)This is the bridge, over…
Oh… It's you. Quit playing around and get
back up here, Vyse!!!\c"
Ms034b008,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b009,"\h(《Aika》)This is the bridge!!
Vyse?! What are you doing there! Hurry
up and fix this ship!!\c"
Ms034b010,"\h(《Vyse》)I suppose this is the best place to hang
laundry. It dries the fastest out here, even
though it doesn't look very nice.\c"
Ms034b011,"\h(《Vyse》)Since this ship has such a nice kitchen, the
crew can eat home-cooked meals, even way up
here in the sky.\c"
Ms034b012,"\h(《Vyse》)The ship's pretty badly damaged. I better
hurry up and fix her… If we get into another
battle like this, we're finished.\c"
Ms034b013,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like Muraji's locked this door. Who's
ship does he think this is, anyway?!\c"
Ms034b014,"\h(《Vyse》)The door's locked. I should make my way to the
bridge, anyway… That's where Muraji is!\c"
Ms034a020,"\h(《Vyse》)It's too dangerous to go outside in this
place. I should leave these doors closed
and locked.\c"
