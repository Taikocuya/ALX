MH0110000,"\h(《Moegi》)You must be very tired.
You are welcome to stay in the Royal Guest
House tonight.\e"
MH0110001,\h(《Fina》)Thank you for escorting us.\e
MH0110002,\h(《Vyse》)That was some of the best food I've ever had. \e
MH0110003,"\h(《Aika》)And for some reason, I pictured those eating-
sticks to be much bigger. It took me a while
to get used to them, though.\e"
MH0110004,\h(《Moegi》)I am very happy that you enjoyed yourselves.\e
MH0110005,"\h(《Muraji》)Heh heh heh…
So, the Westerners do have a sense of taste
after all…\e"
MH0110006,"\h(《Muraji》)I came here to personally thank you for
retrieving the Maga Sphere.\e"
MH0110007,"\h(《Muraji》)I will be sure and take care of it when it is
passed on to me as soon as Moegi and I are
married…\e"
MH0110008,\h(《Moegi》)I will never marry you!\e
MH0110009,"\h(《Moegi》)And as long as Daigo is alive, you'll never be
king!\e"
MH0110010,"\h(《Muraji》)Have you forgotten that “Prince” Daigo has been
exiled for treason?\e"
MH0110011,"\h(《Muraji》)Heh heh… I find it very unlikely that 
a traitor would ever become king.\e"
MH0110012,\h(《Fina》)Moegi…?\e
MH0110013,"\h(《Vyse》)Okay, that's it…\e"
MH0110014,\h(《Vyse》)Huh? Enrique?!\e
MH0110015,"\h(《Enrique》)I don't know your motives, but this is NOT how
a nobleman treats a lady.\e"
MH0110016,"\h(《Enrique》)If you insist on insulting her, then you will
have to deal with me!\e"
MH0110017,"\h(《Muraji》)You think you can push me around just because
you got the Maga Sphere back…\e"
MH0110018,\h(《Muraji》)I'm going to tell my father on you!\e
MH0110019,"\h(《Moegi》)Prince Enrique…
I… I'm terribly sorry…\e"
MH0110020,"\h(《Moegi》)I'm sorry you felt that you had to defend me
like that… I didn't mean to put you in that
position…\e"
MH0110021,"\h(《Enrique》)No no… That's quite alright. Where I come 
from, we have codes of honor on how a lady,
such as yourself, should be treated.\e"
MH0110022,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, honestly, not many people follow 
that code anymore.\e"
MH0110023,\h(《Moegi》)Prince Enrique…\e
MH0110024,"\h(《Enrique》)But, Muraji spoke of an exiled prince…\e"
MH0110025,\h(《Enrique》)Do you know what he was talking about?\e
MH0110026,\h(《Moegi》)……\e
MH0110027,"\h(《Moegi》)…It, it is nothing.
If… if you'll excuse me, I will be returning
to my quarters. Pleasant dreams…\e"
MH0110028,\h(《Enrique》)……\e
MH0110029,"\h(《Muraji》)Those Westerners… they'll pay for speaking 
to me like that.\e"
MH0110030,"\h(《Female Voice》)Hahaha…
Well, what have we here?\e"
MH0110031,"\h(《Muraji》)Eeek!
Who… who are you?!\e"
MH0110032,"\h(《Belleza》)Shh…
I heard everything.\e"
MH0110033,"\h(《Belleza》)My name is Belleza.
And it appears that we have a common enemy.
Hahaha…\e"
MH0310000,\h(《Aika》)…It seems like they've been talking forever!\e
MH0310001,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, you know how formal those diplomatic talks
are. It takes forever for them to decide who
gets to sit down first.\e"
MH0310002,"\h(《Moegi》)Everyone!
Quickly! You must get out of here!\e"
MH0310003,"\h(《Enrique》)Princess Moegi?!
What happened?!\e"
MH0310004,"\h(《Moegi》)Kangan and Muraji have betrayed us! 
My father… has been taken prisoner!\e"
MH0310005,\h(《Moegi》)It was Belleza's doing…\e
MH0310006,\h(《Vyse》)What?!\e
MH0310007,"\h(《Enrique》)Belleza! It figures. She probably met with those
two before the meeting and had the whole thing
planned out.\e"
MH0310008,\h(《Aika》)Vyse! What should we do?!\e
MH0310009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Save Lord Mikado now!”
“Run and hide.”\e"
MH0310010,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you think?
We have to go rescue the king!\e"
MH0310011,"\h(《Moegi》)That's impossible!
Enemy soldiers have already taken the palace!\e"
MH0310012,"\h(《Moegi》)We have no time.
Quickly, follow me!\e"
MH0310013,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm sorry, but we have to run for now.
Belleza has probably already convinced the
Yafutoman Guards that we are criminals.\e"
MH0310014,"\h(《Enrique》)I agree. We should run for now and figure out
what to do next.\e"
MH0310015,"\h(《Moegi》)Very well then.
Quickly, follow me!\e"
MH0310016,\h(《Moegi》)We can escape from the palace this way. Hurry!\e
M08000000,\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Come right on in! What can I get for you?\e
M08000001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about this and that.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08000002,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Tenkou is the name of a gang of outlaws. They go
around seizing weapons, spouting something about
how bare hands are more powerful.\e"
M08000003,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)You say you ran into a Tenkou?
You're lucky you got away without losing your
weapons or your life.\e"
M08000004,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08000005,\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Come right on in! What can I get for you?\e
M08000006,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about this and that.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08000007,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)I don't suppose you folks knew this, but the
chief of the Tenkou gang is one extremely strong
guy.\e"
M08000008,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)You know those two twins you guys defeated? Well
I hear this guy got to be chief by brushing them
aside like a couple of babies.\e"
M08000009,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08000010,\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Come right on in! What can I get for you?\e
M08000011,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about this and that.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08000012,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)So you overpowered that hateful Kangan.
That certainly gets a load off of my chest.
You're a man to be reckoned with! \e"
M08000013,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Hey, you know what? There's this isolated island
way up north, straight north of here.
I think you should go there.\e"
M08000014,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)I've heard there's a guy living there called
Ryu-kan. He's supposed to be a really phenomenal
swordsmith.\e"
M08000015,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08010000,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)Well, my, my. What can I do for you?\e"
M08010001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and Sell Items”
“Talk about various things”
“Leave”\e"
M08010002,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)The Great Wall that surrounds this island was
built by our ancestors in order to protect the
country.\e"
M08010003,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)But the Great Wall isn't what really protects
us.
What really protects us is the Blue Winds.\e"
M08010004,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)All right, then. Please come again.\e"
M08010005,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)They say a fleet of black steel ships has come,
but there's really nothing to worry about.
Nah, everything's going to be just fine.\e"
M08010006,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)When the time comes, the Blue Winds will blow
and save us. It has protected our country since
ancient times, and it won't fail us now.\e"
M08010007,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)Now I've had a good look at you, you're quite a
handsome fellow, aren't you? If only I were 70
years younger… Oh, my! What am I talking about!\e"
M08010008,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)Look what you've made a poor old woman say, you
naughty little boy, you. My face is scarlet... \e"
M08010009,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)When I was young, everyone was quite taken with
Lord Mikado, but nowadays it's Prince Daigo.\e"
M08010010,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant》)Oh, my! Look what you've made a poor old woman
say, you naughty little boy, you.
I'm so embarrassed. My face is burning…\e"
M08030000,"\h(《Urala》)Oh! Please come in!
What can I get you?\e"
M08030001,"\h(《Aika》)Looks like they have waitresses in Yafutoma,
too! \e"
M08030002,\h(《Urala》)Waitr…? \e
M08030003,"\h(《Urala》)I, I'm sorry.
We don't have anything like that on hand.\e"
M08030004,"\h(《Aika》)A ha ha ha. You misunderstood!
We were talking about you.\e"
M08030005,\h(《Urala》)Huh…?\e
M08030006,"\h(《Urala》)Oh. I, I'm sorry.
I, I thought it was what you wanted to order.\e"
M08030007,"\h(《Aika》)Don't mention it. We're the ones who should
apologize. We're in a bit of a rush right now,
but we'll come back some other time, okay?\e"
M08030008,"\h(《Urala》)Al, alright.
Um… Thank you for coming in.\e"
M08030009,"\h(《Urala》)N, next time you come, be sure to try our
scrumptious dumplings as well as our piping hot
sweetbean soup.\e"
M08030010,"\h(《Vyse》)… Say,
are you by any chance Kirala's little sister?\e"
M08030011,"\h(《Urala》)Y, yes… I am.
But why do you ask?\e"
M08030012,"\h(《Aika》)I thought so!
Actually, Kirala has decided to join the crew of
our ship as a builder.\e"
M08030013,"\h(《Aika》)We're wondering if you might be interested in
joining our crew, too.\e"
M08030014,"\h(《Urala》)Me? B, but…
unlike my sister, I'm not good for much of
anything besides cooking.\e"
M08030015,"\h(《Vyse》)Cooking is a perfectly fine skill to have.
How would you like to join our crew as a cook?\e"
M08030016,"\h(《Urala》)S, sure, okay.
If my sister's joining too.
But are you sure I qualify for the job?\e"
M08030017,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course you do.
You can make us all kinds of tasty Yafutoman
dishes.\e"
M08030018,"\h(《Urala》)W, well!
Um… I, I'll really do my best.
Thank you so much.\e"
M08030019,\h(　)Urala has joined your crew as a “Cook.”\c
M08030020,"\h(《Urala》)Um… When you're not busy,
please feel free to drop in any time.\e"
M08030021,"\h(《Urala》)Oh. You were here the other day, weren't you?
Welcome back.\e"
M08030022,"\h(《Aika》)Hi! Excuse me,
but would you happen to be Kirala's little
sister by any chance?\e"
M08030023,"\h(《Urala》)Y, yes… I am.
But why do you ask?\e"
M08030024,"\h(《Aika》)I thought so!
Actually, Kirala has decided to join the crew of
our ship as a builder.\e"
M08030025,"\h(《Aika》)We're wondering if you might be interested in
joining our crew, too.\e"
M08030026,"\h(《Urala》)Me? B, but…
unlike my sister, I'm not good for much of
anything besides cooking.\e"
M08030027,"\h(《Vyse》)Cooking is a perfectly fine skill to have.
How would you like to join our crew as a cook?\e"
M08030028,"\h(《Urala》)S, sure, okay.
If my sister's joining too.
But are you sure I qualify for the job?\e"
M08030029,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course you do.
You can make us all kinds of tasty Yafutoman
dishes.\e"
M08030030,"\h(《Urala》)A, alright!
Um… I, I'll really do my best.
Thank you so much.\e"
M08030031,\h(　)Urala has joined your crew as a “Cook.”\c
M08040000,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)We serve the best tea and dumplings here, and
thanks to Urala, we've also got the most popular
teahouse in town. \e"
M08040001,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)I don't suppose you Westerners can taste the
difference, though.
A hah hah.\e"
M08040002,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)Did I hear that a throng of Westerners have
come to town? Sounds like the perfect chance to
spread the word about our tasty dumplings.\e"
M08040003,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)Though I don't suppose Westerners have such
discriminating tastebuds as to tell the
difference. A hah hah.\e"
M08040004,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)It's a shame we never had a chance to serve the
Westerners our delectable dumplings.
We missed out on a great business opportunity.\e"
M08040005,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)If you guys had just taken it a little easier,
we could have had them taste our dumplings.\e"
M08040006,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)Now that Urala is leaving here, it feels
like a part of this place is leaving with
her. She brought so much life to this place.\e"
M08040007,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)Without her… this place will feel so empty.
But, she is free to live her own life. I wish
her the best of luck.\c"
M08040008,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)Now that Urala is leaving here, it feels
like a part of this place is leaving with
her. She brought so much life to this place.\e"
M08040009,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)Without her… this place will feel so empty.
But, she is free to live her own life. I wish
her the best of luck.\c"
M08050000,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)That girl Urala who works here is an excellent
cook and seems very domestic, but she's rather
reserved and bashful.\e"
M08050001,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)By contrast, her older sister is the assertive
type, and a very skilled builder as well.
They're polar opposites, really.\e"
M08050002,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)If you were to ask which I'd prefer for a wife…
well… it's a really tough choice.\e"
M08050003,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)Would I choose the domestic Urala, or the more
out-going Kirala? I'm afraid I really don't know
how to rank them one over the other.\e"
M08050004,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)What's that?
You say some foreign ships have come into port?
Now hold on just a minute. \e"
M08050005,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)At times like this, you can't let yourself
panic; you have to keep your calm. To wit, it's
best to start by having a quiet cup of tea…\e"
M08050006,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)The truth of the matter is, I'm so flabbergasted
that I've lost my legs.
But don't tell that to Urala. \e"
M08050007,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)Please don't tell Urala that I've lost my legs
and can't stand up.\e"
M08050008,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)What's that?
You chased off the foreign ships?
Well done!\e"
M08050009,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)By the way, stranger.
Please don't tell Urala that I… behaved a
little cowardly…\e"
M08050010,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)I am not surprised that after learning her older
sister, Kirala, would be leaving with you, that
she, too, decided to leave.\e"
M08050011,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)But to think that two of the most beautiful
women in all of Yafutoma will be leaving at the
same time is very saddening…\c"
M08050012,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)I'm sure that no matter where Urala is, she will
always be able to cook amazing food.\e"
M08050013,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)Urala is very skilled at cooking using a fish
called “Romuhai fish.” Perhaps you should try
some of her special dishes someday.\c"
M08050014,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)Urala is very skilled at cooking using a fish
called “Romuhai fish.” Perhaps you should try
some of her special dishes someday.\c"
M08100000,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)This land of Yafutoma is a beautiful country of 
countless islands large and small lying beneath 
the Blue Moon. \e"
M08100001,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Oh, visitor from the distant west! May you taste
our bountiful water and breathe our clear, crisp
air till your heart's content.\e"
M08100002,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)And when you decide to go to Mt. Kazai, please 
make your way to the ship parts dealer located 
down near the waterfront. \e"
M08100003,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)I have already spoken to him about escorting you
folks to Mt. Kazai. \e"
M08100004,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)When you decide to go to Mt. Kazai, please make 
your way to the ship parts dealer located down 
near the waterfront. \e"
M08100005,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)I have already spoken to him about escorting you
folks to Mt. Kazai. \e"
M08100006,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Ahh, you folks, there! Lord Mikado has been
waiting for you. Please, please. Come right this
way.\c"
M08100007,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Ahh, you folks, there! I have heard that a fleet
of foreign ships has gathered off shore.
Can you tell me what it is about?\e"
M08100008,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Ahh, you folks, there! The Divine Wind really 
did blow, did it not? The legend has proved to 
be true!\e"
M08100009,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Ahh, you folks, there! Take care that you don't 
become a burden to Prince Daigo.\e"
M08110000,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)My apologies. I did not realize that you were
persons whom Lord Mikado wished to see.\e"
M08110001,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)However, since it is my job to protect the state
and restore order, I beg you to overlook any
offense I may have caused. \e"
M08110002,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)I must say, it is quite scandalous how much skin
your apparel leaves exposed. You Westerners
must really be shameless people.\e"
M08110003,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)That is… I mean… perhaps “shameless” was
rather too strong of a word. I beg you to
overlook any offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110004,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)That is… I mean… perhaps “shameless” was
rather too strong of a word. I beg you to
overlook any offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110005,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Hark! Could that be the Maga Sphere? I never
would have believed that mere children could
find it and actually bring it back. \e"
M08110006,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)That is… I mean… I didn't mean that… um… you
are mere children. I beg you to overlook any
offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110007,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)I understand a fleet of black steel ships has 
come into port. I wonder if I can't sneak out 
somehow to go have a look…\e"
M08110008,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)That is… I mean… It was indiscreet of me to
say such a thing. I beg you to overlook any
offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110009,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Ever since you folks showed up, we've had a
civil war, and dealt with that bird monster that
appeared out of nowhere…\c"
M08110010,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)And we've had nothing but trouble… I mean, that
is, I'm joking. To put it another way…\e"
M08110011,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)We've had a lot of difficulties, one after
another. But they must have all been good omens,
since Prince Daigo is back with us once again.\c"
M08110012,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)We've had a lot of difficulties, one after
another. But they must have all been good omens,
since Prince Daigo is back with us once again.\c"
M08170000,"\h(《Big Sister》)Come on! Hurry up and get in! You said you'd
practice sailing in this tub ship!\e"
M08170001,"\h(《Big Sister》)If you can't even sail a tub ship, you're never
going to be able to help search for Prince
Daigo.\c"
M08170002,"\h(《Big Sister》)There's a whole fleet of strange ships in the
harbor. We don't have a chance like this very
often, so let's go see them.\e"
M08170003,"\h(《Big Sister》)There's no reason to be afraid. You're not
afraid of the foreigner in the blue suit, are
you?\c"
M08170004,"\h(《Big Sister》)Prince Daigo beat up all of the outlaws and came
back home!\e"
M08170005,"\h(《Big Sister》)Oh. They say he's putting on some clean clothes.
I sure wish I could hurry up and play with him!\c"
M08170006,"\h(《Big Sister》)Anyway, it's about time you at least learned to
sail a tub ship!\c"
M08180000,"\h(《Young Man》)Hello. You must be one of those Westerners I've
heard about. It's really true that you don't
have black eyes and hair, isn't it?!\e"
M08180001,"\h(《Young Man》)My dream is to bring lots of Westerners like
you to this country as tourists. \e"
M08180002,"\h(《Young Man》)I want people from all over the world to see our
picturesque Mt. Kazai.\e"
M08180003,"\h(《Young Man》)Really! Can there be any sight more picturesque
than this? And just look at what perfect weather
it is today!\e"
M08180004,"\h(《Young Man》)How I'd like to be able to show this splendid
view to other visitors from your country!\e"
M08180005,"\h(《Young Man》)A huge fleet of ships, such as I've never seen
before, passed by near hear.\e"
M08180006,"\h(《Young Man》)I wonder if they could be tourists?
Perhaps the beauty of our fair country is
finally becoming known to the Westerners.\e"
M08180007,"\h(《Young Man》)Hello. You must be one of those Westerners I've
heard about. It's really true that you don't
have black eyes and hair, isn't it?!\e"

M08180011,"\h(《Young Man》)How I'd like to be able to show this splendid
view to other visitors from your country!\e"
M08190000,"\h(《Little Sister》)Nooo! I don't want to practice sailing! I don't
care if I can't sail a tub ship!\e"
M08190001,"\h(《Little Sister》)Prince Daigo will come back home by himself just
fine, even if I don't go searching for him!\c"
M08190002,"\h(《Little Sister》)No, I won't go. I don't care about the foreign
ships.\e"
M08190003,"\h(《Little Sister》)But I'd be too scared! What if the foreigners
kidnapped us and took us away?\c"
M08190004,"\h(《Little Sister》)Prince Daigo finally came home, but now they say
Princess Moegi is going somewhere.\e"
M08190005,"\h(《Little Sister》)I'm going to be so lonesome when the nice
princess goes away. Sniffle sniffle.\c"
M08190006,\h(《Little Sister》)Nooo! I don't care if I can't sail a tub ship!\c
M08200000,\h(《Koketa》)Cluck cluck! Cluck! \e
M08200001,"\h(《What's with this bird?》)“Looks tasty!”
“It's kind of cute!”
“Go away! Shoo! Shoo!”\e"
M08200002,"\h(《Vyse》)This bird… looks rather tasty, don't you think?\e"
M08200003,\h(《Koketa》)Looks tasty! Looks tasty!\c
M08200004,"\h(《Aika》)My goodness, it's mimicking you!
Don't you go teaching it any naughty words, now,
Vyse. \e"
M08200005,\h(《Koketa》)Looks tasty! Looks tasty!\e
M08200006,"\h(《Vyse》)This bird… it's kind of cute, don't you think?\e"
M08200007,\h(《Koketa》)Kind of cute! Kind of cute!\e
M08200008,"\h(《Aika》)My goodness, it's mimicking you!
Don't you go teaching it any naughty words, now,
Vyse. \e"
M08200009,\h(《Koketa》)Kind of cute! Kind of cute!\e
M08200010,\h(《Vyse》)What's with this bird? Go away! Shoo! Shoo!\e
M08200011,\h(《Koketa》)Shoo! Shoo! Go away! Shoo! Shoo!\e
M08200012,"\h(《Aika》)My goodness, it's mimicking you!
Don't you go teaching it any naughty words, now,
Vyse. \e"
M08200013,\h(《Koketa》)Shoo! Shoo! Go away! Shoo! Shoo!\e
M08200014,\h(《Koketa》)Looks tasty! Looks tasty!\c
M08200015,\h(《Koketa》)Kind of cute! Kind of cute!\e
M08200016,\h(《Koketa》)Shoo! Shoo! Go away! Shoo! Shoo!\e
M08210000,"\h(《Hikaru》)Hey, it's a foreigner! Step right up for your
tub ships. You can get on and off at a dock!\c"
Ms019d000,"\h(《Vyse》)That's interesting… they're using Blue Moon
Stones as fuel for these flames. That why the
fire is blue… It must look pretty at night.\c"
Ms019d001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a Yafutoman-style bed. Maybe I'll just
lie down for a bit…\e"
Ms019d002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Rest up for a little bit.”
“Nothing.”\e"
Ms019d003,"\h(《Vyse》)Actually, I'm not really that tired yet.
I think I'll look around some more.\c"
Ms019d004,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder what this blue bird is supposed to be.
Maybe it's a symbol of their god or something.\c"
Ms019d005,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess this picture is supposed to be a
drawing of Bluheim. Heh… It doesn't really look
much like it.\c"
Ms019d006,"\h(《Vyse》)This is an… um… interesting sculpture.
I wonder what it's supposed to be. I'm guessing
that it has some sort of hidden meaning…\c"
Ms019d007,"\h(《Vyse》)Ah… This thing is supposed to represent the
Blue Moon Crystal. I never would have guessed
that without having seen the Crystal, first.\c"
Ms019d008,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)I'm very sorry, but the king is busy at the
moment. Please come back at another time.\c"
Ms019d009,\h(《Vyse》)I don't have time to be just relaxing here!\c
