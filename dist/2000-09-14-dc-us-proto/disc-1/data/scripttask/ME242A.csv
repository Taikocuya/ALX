MG0230000,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, you're here.\e"
MG0230001,"\h(《Enrique》)That huge armored ship belongs to Admiral
Gregorio.  \e"
MG0230002,"\h(《Enrique》)Gregorio is the best defensive tactician the 
Valuan Armada has ever seen. 
They even nicknamed him “Ironwall.”\e"
MG0230003,"\h(《Vyse》)Interesting… he's forming a blockade 
around the town.\e"
MG0230004,\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Prince Enrique!\e
MG0230005,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I've come on behalf of Admiral Gregorio. 
He has an urgent message for you.\e"
MG0230006,"\h(《Enrique》)I see.
Well done.\e"
MG0230007,\h(《Enrique》)“I hope my Prince finds himself in good health.”\e
MG0230008,"\h(《Enrique》)“I heard that you had a change of heart, 
or were perhaps brainwashed by the Air Pirates.”\e"
MG0230009,"\h(《Enrique》)“Empress Teodora has sent me to escort 
my Prince back to Valua, 
so that he may recover.”\e"
MG0230010,"\h(《Enrique》)“I do not wish to use force. Please come back
with me.”\e"
MG0230011,"\h(《Enrique》)“If my Prince refuses to comply, my ships will 
regretably begin firing upon the city tomorrow 
at noon.   Your Humble Servant, Gregorio”\e"
MG0230012,"\h(《Enrique》)…Hmm… Uncle Gregorio is asking me to
surrender.\e"
MG0230013,\h(《Vyse》)Uncle?\e
MG0230014,"\h(《Enrique》)Oh, Gregorio was an Admiral in the Armada even
before my father passed away…\e"
MG0230015,"\h(《Enrique》)He helped raise me when I was growing up… 
He's always been like an uncle to me.  \e"
MG0230016,"\h(《Enrique》)I know that he doesn't want to fight, and he
really does want me to surrender…\e"
MG0230017,"\h(《Enrique》)…But I can't go back. Not after everything
they've done.\e"
MG0230018,\h(《Enrique》)Even if… even if it means I have to fight him.\e
MG0230019,\h(《Vyse》)Enrique?\e
MG0230020,"\h(《Enrique》)Let's rest up for tomorrow. Gregorio is the most
honorable man that I've ever met. He won't break
his word.\e"
MG0230021,"\h(《Vyse》)I understand.
We should rest on land tonight and keep you off
the ship until tomorrow.\e"
MG0230022,"\h(《Vyse》)The last thing you need is for your “Uncle” to
see you throwing up over the railing in the heat
of battle.\e"
MG0230023,"\h(《Enrique》)…Great… now you're starting to sound just like
Aika.\e"
MG0230024,"\h(《Vyse》)Haha, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Come on, let's stay
at the inn tonight. We're gonna need our rest.\e"
MG0240000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's time to go fight Admiral Gregorio.
It's going to be a tough battle.
Give it everything you've got!\e"
MG0240001,\h(《Everyone》)Aye aye!\e
MG0240002,"\h(《Don》)Hey…
You aren't actually goin' to fight against the
Armada, are ya?\e"
MG0240003,\h(《Vyse》)Huh?\e
MG0240004,"\h(《Don》)You're planning to fight Admiral Gregorio by
yourselves?\e"
MG0240005,\h(《Vyse》)Yup. That's the plan.\e
MG0240006,"\h(《Don》)I don't doubt your abilities, but I used to be a
Valuan Soldier. I know what the Armada can do.
Going up against one of their Admirals is crazy.\e"
MG0240007,"\h(《Vyse》)Our ship is the best there is. We're faster
than Gregorio's ship, and I think we can match
his firepower.\e"
MG0240008,"\h(《Don》)But… even if you win… 
You'll never get through the Dark Rift!\e"
MG0240009,"\h(《Vyse》)Like I said yesterday, our ship is the best 
there is. Our engines are more powerful 
than you think.\e"
MG0240010,"\h(《Vyse》)And it might just be powerful enough to get us 
through the Dark Rift. Besides…\e"
MG0240011,"\h(《Vyse》)Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to
see what was beyond the edge of the world.\e"
MG0240012,"\h(《Vyse》)That very edge is right in front of me. I have a
chance to do what nobody has ever done before.
I have a chance to make history today.\e"
MG0240013,"\h(《Vyse》)If I said that I'm not scared, I'd be lying.
But, I won't let this opportunity pass me by.\e"
MG0240014,"\h(《Vyse》)The chance to fulfill my childhood dreams lies
right in front of me. You don't expect me to
just give up, do you?\e"
MG0240015,"\h(《Don》)Heh heh… I suppose, then, no matter what I say,
you're not goin' to listen…\e"
MG0240016,"\h(《Don》)The Dark Rift is a giant vortex. If you can get 
through one side, you'll reach the eye in the 
middle. It is rumored that the eye is calm.\e"
MG0240017,"\h(《Don》)There are other calm pockets along the edges 
of the Dark Rift. If you find one of the 
pockets, you might have half of a chance.\e"
MG0240018,"\h(《Vyse》)I see…
Thank you!\e"
MG0240019,\h(《Vyse》)I'll come back here when I'm done… I promise!\e
MG0240020,"\h(《Don》)Heh…
Kid, you're just like me when I was your age…\e"
MG0260000,"\h(《Former Sailor》)Yeah! Go!
Turn!!! No, not that way!!!\e"
MG0260001,"\h(《Sailor》)You idiots! What are you doing?
You're supposed to fire all your cannons right
there!!\e"
MG0260002,"\h(《Former Sailor》)Yeah, get them!!!
Hey, they're not that bad!!\e"
MG0260003,\h(《Everyone》)Huh?!\e
MG0260004,"\h(《Everyone》)Aaaaahhhh!!!
Incoming!!!\e"
MG0260005,"\h(《Don》)They still need to get past the next line of
ships… They still have a long way to go!\e"
MG0280000,"\h(《Enrique》)I always thought that if we were ever in battle
together that we'd be on the same side.\e"
MG0280001,"\h(《Gregorio》)Prince Enrique.
Is there anything I can do to make you
reconsider?\e"
MG0280002,"\h(《Enrique》)…No… I've made up my mind.
I am not going back to Valua.\e"
MG0280003,"\h(《Enrique》)I know that you've noticed a change in the
Empire as well… 
They are headed down a dark path…\e"
MG0280004,"\h(《Enrique》)Trying to rule the world with an iron fist… 
It will be Valua's downfall…\e"
MG0280005,"\h(《Enrique》)This world… this sky… is not Valua's to rule.
It belongs to the people.\e"
MG0280006,\h(《Gregorio》)……\e
MG0280007,"\h(《Enrique》)And to right the wrongs that Valua has commited,
I have decided to travel with Vyse and his
companions.\e"
MG0280008,"\h(《Enrique》)Tell that to my mother.
And also that I pray every day for her good
health.\e"
MG0280009,"\h(《Enrique》)This is goodbye.
I must go. Be well.\e"
MG0280010,"\h(《Gregorio》)Farewell, Young Prince.\e"
MG0280011,"\h(《Crazy Sailor》)Those kids are great! They just took out the
Armada with one ship!\e"
MG0280012,"\h(《Former Sailor》)HaHaHa!
They make me feel like sailing again!\e"
MG0280013,"\h(《Don》)Vyse…
You put on quite a show…\e"
MG0280014,"\h(《Don》)If you make it back from the Dark Rift… 
I hope you come back here 
and take me with you…\e"
MG0280015,"\h(《Don》)I can't believe I'm saying this…
You hear me, kid?! You better make it back!\e"
MG0310000,"\h(《Vyse》)That sky rift looks worse 
than any of the others… \e"
MG0310001,"\h(《Aika》)If we tried to power our way through it, I think
the Delphinus would get ripped to pieces.\e"
MG0310002,"\h(《Vyse》)But, if we don't go through there, we won't be
able to reach Yafutoma. Isn't there something we
can do?\e"
MG0310003,\h(《Enrique》)Ungh…\e
MG0310004,"\h(《Aika》)Enrique, are you feeling any better?\e"
MG0310005,"\h(《Enrique》)No…
To be completely honest, I feel awful.\e"
MG0310006,"\h(《Enrique》)Why don't you guys take a look around the city?
I don't think it would be wise for me to move in
my condition.\e"
MG0310007,\h(《Fina》)I'll stay here and look after Enrique.\e
MG0310008,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright. Aika, let's go check out the city.
Someone here has to know how to get to Yafutoma.\e"
