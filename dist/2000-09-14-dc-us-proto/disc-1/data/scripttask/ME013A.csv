MF0150000,"\h(《Clara》)It's about time for me to set sail. It was very 
nice meeting the two of you. I'm sorry we 
couldn't spend more time together.\e"
MF0150001,"\h(《Clara》)Here… take this. It's only 5,000 gold, 
but it should help.\e"
MF0150002,\h(　)You received “Clara's Purse.”\e
MF0150003,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! Really?! Thanks for everything you've done 
for us. First you save our lives, 
then you give us gold…\e"
MF0150004,"\h(《Clara》)Don't give it a second thought.
After all, I too, am a Blue Rogue.\e"
MF0150005,"\h(《Fina》)Where are you going now, Clara?\e"
MF0150006,"\h(《Clara》)Me?
Well, I'm going after the man I love.\e"
MF0150007,"\h(《Clara》)He's an Air Pirate, too… 
He's a little on the wild side, but he's strong,
smart, and so… \e"
MF0150008,"\h(《Clara》)Yummy… I follow him wherever he goes. I know 
that someday, he'll come around and fall in 
love with me, too. Isn't that romantic?\e"
MF0150009,\h(《Aika》)Umm… sure!\e
MF0150010,"\h(《Clara》)Well, I'd better get going! \e"
MF0150011,\h(《Clara》)I hope we see each other again! Good luck!\e
MF0150012,"\h(《Aika》)That was the nicest stalker that I've ever met. 
But at least it explains why her entire ship 
looks like a honeymoon suite.\e"
MF0150013,\h(《Fina》)Honeymoon?\e
MF0150014,"\h(《Aika》)I kinda figured you wouldn't know what that
was… Don't worry about it. Let's go see if
we can find a place to sleep tonight. \e"
MF0250000,"\h(《Aika》)Alright!
It's a little small, but we bought a ship!\e"
MF0250001,"\h(《Fina》)Yes, but the gold that we got from Clara and 
from working is all gone now.\e"
MF0250002,"\h(《Aika》)Don't worry about it, Fina.
All we need to do is find Daccat's Treasure and
we'll be fine!\e"
MF0250003,"\h(《Aika》)Let me see, did the map say where the island was
located?\e"
MF0250004,"\h(《Aika》)“The dead will always watch over my treasure. 
It is located…”\e"
MF0250005,"\h(《Fina》)Well, where is it?\e"
MF0250006,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, no!!
It's torn off! I can't see what it says!\e"
MF0250007,"\h(《Aika》)Looks like the only way we'll be able to find 
the island is by this clue. I think this skull
on the map has something to do with it.\e"
MF0250008,"\h(《Aika》)Well, it's not going to do us any good just 
sitting around and doing nothing. We might as 
well start searching!\e"
MF0250009,\h(《Fina》)Yes!\e
MF0260000,"\h(《Gilder》)Well then!
Let's go find us some treasure!\e"
MF0260001,\h(《Vyse》)Okay. There are some directions on the map…\e
MF0260002,"\h(《Vyse》)“… to the north of the City of the Sands. 
When the two pieces become whole, the way 
to the treasure will be known.”\e"
MF0260003,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't read anything before that… 
It's torn off. That's all it says.\e"
MF0260004,"\h(《Gilder》)“The city of the sands” probably refers to the 
city that was here before Nasrad. I think it was
called Oasis.\e"
MF0260005,"\h(《Gilder》)So… it's to the north of here, huh? 
We can get there in no time with my ship.\e"
MF0260006,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm a sailor without a ship at this point. 
There's no way I'll be able to search for my 
friends now.\e"
MF0260007,"\h(《Vyse》)If we do find the treasure, I'd like to use my 
share to buy a ship.\e"
MF0260008,"\h(《Gilder》)Hahaha, I like you Vyse, you never give up.
Very well… off we go!\e"
MF0390000,"\h(《Gilder》)I have some personal stuff to take care of 
first. You go on to the inn and rest up. 
I'll catch up with you a little later.\e"
MF0390001,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't mind traveling separately, 
but what is it you need to do, exactly?\e"
MF0390002,"\h(《Gilder》)I need to stop by the tavern for a bit. 
There's a few women there that will 
be happy to see me. Don't wait up…\e"
M06000000,"\h(《Sailor》)Hmm… I have Moon Stones for fuel… 10 barrels
of drinking water… Was there anything else I
needed to get before I leave?\e"
M06000001,"\h(《Sailor》)Welcome to Nasrad, the center of trade!
Anything you need for your travels you can get
right here!\e"
M06000002,"\h(《Sailor》)You guys are sailors too, right?
Maybe you guys should stock up on supplies while
you're here, too.\c"
M06010000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)5 cases of Khale…
And Mid Ocean Sky Sardis… um… 1… 2… 3…\e"
M06010001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Please do not talk to me right now!
Damn! You made me lose count!\c"
M06010002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Sorghum… 10 cases.
Kidney beans… 1… 2… 3…\e"
M06010003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Please do not talk to me right now!
Damn! You made me lose count!\c"
M06330000,"\h(《Large Man》)It is so boring!!
When is Valua going to attack again?!\e"
M06330001,"\h(《Khazim》)I am Nasr's top gunner, Khazim!
If any enemy ships try to enter our port, I blow
them away with this cannon of mine!\e"
M06330002,"\h(《Khazim》)But no enemies have attacked us in such a
long time… I have nothing to do and it is
killing me!\e"
M06330003,"\h(《Khazim》)Ever since I was assigned here, I have not had
the chance to fire these cannons. I hope the
chance comes soon!\c"
M06330004,"\h(《Khazim》)Ever since I was assigned here, I have not had
the chance to fire these cannons. I hope the
chance comes soon!\c"
M06330005,"\h(《Khazim》)I am Khazim, Nasr's top gunner. What do you 
want, boy?\e"
M06330006,"\h(《Khazim》)What? Valua is launching an attack?! Hahahaha! I
have been waiting for this! The Red Moon has
answered my prayers!\e"
M06330007,"\h(《Khazim》)Once Valua gets close enough, I'll knock all of
their puny little ships out of the sky with my
cannon!\e"
M06330008,"\h(《Khazim》)Well, it's not like they would ever get past the
border guards, though…\c"
M06330009,"\h(《Khazim》)Once Valua gets close enough, I'll knock all of
their puny little ships out of the sky with my
cannon!\e"
M06330010,"\h(《Khazim》)Well, it's not like they would ever get past the
border guards, though…\c"
M06340000,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)We are the Nasr Artillery Guard!
Leave the defense of Nasr up to us!\e"
M06340001,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)The cannons are up top!
Any enemy ships that get too close to the city,
we blast out of the sky!\c"
M06350000,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)We are the Nasr Artillery Guard, under the 
leadership of Captain Khazim!
We are defending the safety of Nasrad!\e"
M06350001,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)Khazim is Nasr's best gunner! He's manning the
wall above us!\c"
M90390000,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Hello there!
I am the Mystery Merchant, traveling the world
and selling my goods!\e"
M90390001,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)I have all sorts of rare and unusual items!
Please, come look at my goods!\e"
M90390002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and Sell Items.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M90390003,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)I spend my days traveling from town to town,
selling exotic wares. Please do not hesitate to
approach me if we meet again.\e"
M90390004,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Thank you very much.
I hope we meet again elsewhere.\c"
Ms013a000,"\h(《Vyse》)Now that's a big bonfire.
They must keep it going
to guide ships into the harbor.\c"
Ms013a001,"\h(《Vyse》)That's a lot of lumber. It's probably from
Ixa'taka. I've never seen trees that big
anywhere else in the world…\c"
Ms013a002,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a box full of candy. Hey, this was the type
of candy that Aika used to eat all the time when
we were kids.\c"
Ms013a003,\h(《Vyse》)It's a Nasr civilian ship.\c
Ms013a004,"\h(《Vyse》)The vegetables drawn on the box
are some of Nasr's specialty exports.
I guess they are being shipped abroad.\c"
Ms013a005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's filled to the top with water.
Water's a precious commodity in Nasr.\c"
Ms013a006,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a big cart. They must use this
to carry cargo every day. It looks
really broken in.\c"
Ms013a007,"\h(《Vyse》)The box is labelled “Dhabu Shipping.” I think
I've heard of that company before. They
specialize in cheap and fast shipping.\c"
Ms013a008,"\h(《Vyse》)It says it's full of Mojaca Beans. The one thing
I never understood is how the Mojaca bean can
smell so sweet and yet taste so bitter…\c"
Ms013a009,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a bag of salt.
Salt's important to have
on long voyages.\c"
Ms013a010,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow, that's a whole lotta Khale!
They use Khale a lot in Nasr cooking,
that's why Nasr dishes are so spicy.\c"
Ms013a011,"\h(《Vyse》)Nasr ship design is actually… sorta gawdy.
Maybe Aika would like them…\c"
Ms013a012,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a lot of shipping labels on this one.
Let's see… It went from Valua to Sailors'
Island, and from there to Nasr.\c"
Ms013a013,"\h(《Vyse》)They're exporting weapons and ammunition.
Nasrean cannons are well-known for their
destructive power.\c"
Ms013a014,"\h(《Vyse》)That's a pretty big box.
It looks sturdy, too.
I wonder what's inside?\c"
Ms013a015,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, it's the Valuan royal family emblem.
I guess this shipment came from Valua.\c"
Ms013a016,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like a merchant ship from Mid Ocean.
I wonder if it came from Sailors' Island?\c"
Ms013a017,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a huge… barrel, or something.
It's all sealed up
so I can't see what's inside.\c"
Ms013a018,"\h(《Vyse》)Ugh, it's a bittermelon.
They say it's good for sautees, but
I can't stand it.\c"
Ms013a019,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow, that's a whole lotta Khale!
They use Khale a lot in Nasr cooking,
that's why Nasr dishes are so spicy.\c"
Ms013a020,"\h(《Vyse》)I've never seen this vegetable before.
They've got all kinds of rare things
in Nasrad.\c"
Ms013a021,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like a kind of fruit…
They're got all kinds of rare things
in Nasrad.\c"
Ms013a022,"\h(《Vyse》)This smell…
Is it salted fish?
Whatever it is, it doesn't smell too nice.\c"
Ms013a023,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a box full of Nan, the staple food of
Nasrad. I hear they put food on top of this
and eat it.\c"
Ms013a024,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow, that's a whole lotta Khale!
They use Khale a lot in Nasr cooking,
that's why Nasr dishes are so spicy.\c"
Ms013a025,"\h(《Vyse》)What a big cannon…
I guess they use this to defend
against invaders…\c"
Ms013a026,"\h(《Vyse》)It says, Red Moon Stones.
I wonder if this whole thing
is filled with Moon Stones?\c"
Ms013a027,"\h(《Vyse》)It's filled with huge cannonballs,
but they're covered with dust. I bet they
haven't been used since the Valua-Nasr War.\c"
Ms013a028,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what a big bonfire!
They must keep it burning all the time
to guide ships into the harbor.\c"
Ms013a029,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, that's a lot of lumber…
I wonder if it's from Ixa'taka?\c"
Ms013a030,"\h(《Aika》)It's a box full of candy!
I used to love it when the Cap'n would bring
candy back to Pirate Island after a raid.\c"
Ms013a031,\h(《Aika》)It's a Nasr civilian ship.\c
Ms013a032,"\h(《Aika》)Does this have vegetables inside?
It has a cute picture on the box.
I guess it's being exported.\c"
Ms013a033,"\h(《Aika》)What a big barrel!
I could probably fit in one of these.
I wonder what's in… oh, it's just water.\c"
Ms013a034,"\h(《Aika》)That's a huge cart!
I guess they pile it high with stuff
and carry it.\c"
Ms013a035,"\h(《Aika》)Dhabu Shipping… Oh, yeah, I heard
it was a convoy that specialized
in shipping things.\c"
Ms013a036,"\h(《Aika》)Mojaca Beans.
Mmm, I love this smell.\c"
Ms013a037,"\h(《Aika》)That's a big bag.
Hmm… looks like it's just salt inside.\c"
Ms013a038,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, that's the biggest Khale I've ever
seen! You'd probably breathe fire if you
ate one of those!\c"
Ms013a039,"\h(《Aika》)That's a big barrel…
I wonder what's inside?\c"
Ms013a040,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, it's a bittermelon. Vyse hates these.
He used to get yelled at by his mom for
flicking them off his plate when we were kids.\c"
Ms013a041,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, that's the biggest Khale I've ever
seen! You'd probably breathe fire if you
ate one of those!\c"
Ms013a042,"\h(《Aika》)I've never seen vegetables like that.
I bet there's lots of rare things in Nasr.\c"
Ms013a043,"\h(《Aika》)Is that some kind of fruit?
There sure are lots of rare things in Nasr.\c"
Ms013a044,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, it's salted fish.
Cap'n Drachma used to eat salted fish all the
time. I wonder how he's doing…\c"
Ms013a045,"\h(《Aika》)There's lots of Nan.
It's Nasr's main staple food, and it's
convenient for voyages, too.\c"
Ms013a046,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, that's the biggest Khale I've ever
seen! You'd probably breathe fire if you
ate one of those!\c"
Ms013a047,"\h(《Aika》)This ship is so cute!
I bet Vyse would think that the design of
Nasr ships is too gawdy…\c"
Ms013a048,"\h(《Aika》)It's got shipping labels all over it.
I guess this came to Nasr
via Sailors' Island and Valua.\c"
Ms013a049,"\h(《Aika》)It's full of weapons and ammunition.
I guess this is a military nation,
after all.\c"
Ms013a050,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, that's a big box.
It looks pretty sturdy, too.
I wonder what's in it?\c"
Ms013a051,"\h(《Aika》)Is this Valua's emblem?
I guess it's cargo from Valua.\c"
Ms013a052,"\h(《Aika》)It's a Mid Ocean merchant ship.
I wonder if it came from Sailors' Island?\c"
Ms013a053,"\h(《Aika》)What a big cannon…
This could blow a small ship
right out of the sky.\c"
Ms013a054,"\h(《Aika》)It says Red Moon Stones.
I wonder if the whole thing's filled
with Moon Stones?\c"
Ms013a055,"\h(《Aika》)It's full of cannonballs,
but they're covered with dust.
I guess they don't use them too often.\c"
Ms020a056,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Set sail for Daccat's Island.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms020a057,"\h(《Aika》)Hmm, it's a pretty intricate
ship design.
I wonder whose it is?\c"
Ms020a058,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't take off in Gilder's ship
without him…\c"
Ms020a059,"\h(《Vyse》)I want to hurry and set out to find
Daccat's Island, but I should probably
warn the King about Valua while we're here.\c"
Ms020a060,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to your ship.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms013b000,"\h(《Vyse》)That's a pretty nice fountain.
It's strange to see them use water like this
when it's so scarce in Nasr.\c"
Ms013b001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's cool, clear water.
Almost makes me want to go for a swim.
Heh… That would be a little too embarrassing.\c"
Ms013b002,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder what's in the barrel?
Hey, homemade pickles! I hope they won't mind
if I have just a litle taste…\c"
Ms013b003,\h(《Vyse》)“Today's lunch menu…”\e
Ms013b004,"\h(《Vyse》)“Pasta of Pure Passion”
“Steaming Soup of Love”
…I'd be too embarrassed to order anything here.\c"
Ms013b005,"\h(《Vyse》)That's the royal palace ahead. It's surrounded
completely by water. You'd never think that
this was a desert kingdom…\c"
Ms013b006,"\h(　)“Enjoy the comfortable life that
you deserve. This way to Osman's Loans.”\c"
Ms013b007,"\h(《Vyse》)Mmm… This loqua smells great! It looks like
someone sure knows how to pick their Loquat
Berries right!\c"
Ms013b008,"\h(《Vyse》)Flying Fish soaked in oil, smoked Red Sardis…
They have all kinds of expensive foods here.\c"
Ms013b009,"\h(《Vyse》)It says there's Valuan loqua inside.
I guess trade is more important to
Valua and Nasr than being enemies.\c"
Ms013b010,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a well-made sieve.
It looks like it was made
by a master craftsman.\c"
Ms013b011,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, it's a miniature model of the palace.
It's made pretty well.
Hmm… almost makes me want to buy it.\c"
Ms013b012,"\h(《Vyse》)“Nasr Dance Lessons:
Learn the traditional dances of the desert”
I wonder if this is where Belleza learned?\c"
Ms013b013,"\h(《Vyse》)“Observation tower above. Leave your handprint!”
I wonder if I can get a good view of Nasrad
from up there?\c"
Ms013b014,"\h(《Vyse》)Now, that looks nice…
There's flowers floating in the fountain.\c"
Ms013b015,\h(　)Hum dee dum dee dum…\e
Ms013b116,"\h(《Vyse》)Oops…
It sounds like a woman is staying in this room.
I probably should just leave this room alone.\e"
Ms013b117,"\h(《Vyse》)But, that voice…
Why does it so sound familiar?\c"
Ms013b016,"\h(《Vyse》)Now, that's an old compass. I haven't seen one
of these in years! They sure don't make them
like they used to…\c"
Ms013b017,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a wanted poster… Hmm… Nope, no one
I know. To Air Pirates, having a price on your
own head is sort of a status thing.\c"
Ms013b018,"\h(《Vyse》)“Navigator wanted…”
“Treasure map for sale…”
There's all kinds of postings.\c"
Ms013b019,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow… This painting of the royal palace at night
sure looks pretty.\c"
Ms013b020,"\h(《Vyse》)“A real drink for a real man!
A taste of the desert, Khale-Relik Loqua!”
Huh? Who'd want to taste the desert?\c"
Ms013b021,"\h(　)“Soft pastries made by our master chefs!
Perfect for a light snack, any time of the day!”
\c"
Ms013b022,"\h(《Vyse》)So this is what Nasr rugs look like.
I hear they're really expensive.
…Maybe I shouldn't touch it.\c"
Ms013b023,"\h(《Vyse》)They have all sorts of spices. I remember Mom
used to use all kinds of different spices, too…
But, I don't think these are the same kinds.\c"
Ms013b024,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder what this stuff is… It smells a little
like medicine. Maybe they mix this with herbs
and stuff to make medicine?\c"
Ms013b025,"\h(《Vyse》)Ack!
…Oh, it's just a mannequin. It's just dressed
up in traditional Nasrean garb…\c"
Ms013b026,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a pile of weapons and ammunition.
I can't believe they just leave it
out like this.\c"
Ms013b027,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, a Nasr long sword.
Its long, exposed blade is unique
to this region of the world.\c"
Ms013b028,"\h(《Vyse》)This treasure chest is beautifully crafted!
I don't care what's inside… I want to take it
just for the chest itself!\c"
Ms013b029,"\h(《Vyse》)It's an expensive-looking vase. I wonder if
pickles made in a vase like this taste any
better than pickles made in a normal vase…\c"
Ms013b030,"\h(《Vyse》)It's an impressive safe…
I almost want to try to see if I can crack it,
but I shouldn't steal from civilians.\c"
Ms013b031,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a picture of some kind of golden bird. I've
never seen one of those things before… I wonder
where it's from?\c"
Ms013b032,"\h(《Vyse》)The sign… the cushions…
Someone must really like cats.\c"
Ms013b033,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what a beautiful fountain!
It's so weird that there's a fountain like this
in the middle of the desert.\c"
Ms013b034,"\h(《Aika》)The water's so cool and clear!
Maybe I can take off my boots and splash around.
…Or maybe not.\c"
Ms013b035,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, pickles!
No one's looking… Heh, maybe I'll just sneak
a little taste… Mmm! Good!\c"
Ms013b036,\h(《Aika》)“Today's lunch menu…”\e
Ms013b037,"\h(《Aika》)“Romantic Moonlit Desert Steak”
“Prince on a Dhabu Salad”
… These names are so romantic!!\c"
Ms013b038,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, so this is the Nasr royal palace.
A palace floating on water…
It's almost like a fairy tale.\c"
Ms013b039,"\h(　)“Enjoy the comfortable life
you deserve. This way to Osman's Loans”\c"
Ms013b040,"\h(《Aika》)This loqua smells so good! I wonder who made it?
I bet the guys back home would love to have a
glass of this stuff…\c"
Ms013b041,"\h(《Vyse》)Flying Fish soaked in oil, smoked Red Sardis…
It all sounds so good…\c"
Ms013b042,"\h(《Aika》)Valuan loqua, huh?
I bet it's hard to get Valuan loqua here in
Nasr, so it's probably really expensive.\c"
Ms013b043,"\h(《Aika》)This sieve's cute!
It looks pretty sturdy, too. I want one!\c"
Ms013b044,"\h(《Aika》)It's a model of the Nasr royal palace!
Whoever built this must be an excellent artist!
I wish I could make something like this!\c"
Ms013b045,"\h(《Aika》)“Nasr Dance Lessons:
Learn the traditional dances of the desert”
Um… I really don't think I have the time.\c"
Ms013b046,"\h(《Aika》)“Observation tower above. Leave your handprint!”
I wonder if I can get a view of all of Nasrad
from up there?\c"
Ms013b047,"\h(《Aika》)How beautiful!
There's flowers floating in the fountain!\e"
Ms013b048,"\h(《Fina》)I don't think it's very polite
to walk into other people's
rooms, Aika.\e"
Ms013b149,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, sorry!
Yeah, I shouldn't just barge in.
Bad habit!\c"
Ms013b049,"\h(《Aika》)This compass looks pretty old.
Vyse loves looking at
stuff like this…\c"
Ms013b050,"\h(《Aika》)It's a wanted poster.
Doesn't look like they have one for Vyse…
I don't know if that's good or bad…\c"
Ms013b051,"\h(《Aika》)“Navigator wanted…”
“Treasure map for sale…”
There's all kinds of postings here.\c"
Ms013b052,"\h(《Aika》)A night view of the royal palace, huh?
It's kinda romantic…\c"
Ms013b053,"\h(《Aika》)“A real drink for a real man!
A taste of the desert-- Khale-Relik Loqua!”
…Ugh. No thanks.\c"
Ms013b054,"\h(　)“Soft pastries made by our master chefs!
Perfect for a light snack, any time of the day!”
\c"
Ms013b055,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, this is one of those really expensive Nasr
rugs. There's no way I could afford one.\c"
Ms013b056,"\h(《Aika》)There's all kinds of spices. I bet that if I
could use all of these right, I'd be a really
good cook. I suppose that's a big IF, though…\c"
Ms013b057,"\h(《Aika》)There's some dried… stuff. What is this stuff,
anyway? I don't think I've ever seen anything
like this before…\c"
Ms013b058,"\h(《Aika》)Yaah!
…Oh, it's just a mannequin. It's wearing some
Nasrean clothes… It sure scared me, though.\c"
Ms013b059,"\h(《Aika》)Weapons and ammunition…
It's all piled here pretty randomly.\c"
Ms013b060,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what a nice sword! I wish I had the money
to buy it for Vyse… I'm sure he'd love
something like this…\c"
Ms013b061,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what an intricate treasure box!
Let's see what's inside…
Oops… It's locked. It won't open.\c"
Ms013b062,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, this vase looks expensive.
I'd better not touch it, just in case. Knowing
me, I'd probably drop it.\c"
Ms013b063,"\h(《Aika》)That's a pretty impressive safe!
It's got so many locks…
It's just screaming, “Open me!”\c"
Ms013b064,"\h(《Aika》)Hmm… Some sort of golden bird…
Maybe it's supposed to be good luck for business
or something.\c"
Ms013b065,"\h(《Aika》)What a cute cushion!
The cat on the lady's head must be the model.
She must really like cats.\c"
Ms013b066,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, I almost forgot…\e"
Ms013b067,"\h(《Vyse》)Before we head off looking for Daccat's Island,
I should warn the king about Valua's plans.\c"
Ms013b068,"\h(《Vyse》)What's up with this picture?
It looks like someone just
made random strokes with a brush!\c"
Ms013b069,"\h(《Aika》)It looks like random brushstrokes, but if you
keep looking at it, it starts looking like
something… I just can't figure out what…\c"
Ms013b070,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… It won't open.
I guess it's locked.\c"
Ms013b071,"\h(《Aika》)It won't open.
Is it locked or something?\c"
