MA0080000,\h(《Aika》)Hey!\e
MA0080001,\h(《Aika》)Look! She's coming to…\e
MA0080002,\h(《Girl》)Wh… where am I?\e
MA0080003,"\h(《Vyse》)You're aboard our ship, the Albatross.\e"
MA0080004,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm Vyse.
Don't worry, there aren't any Valuan troops 
around, so you'll be safe here.\e"
MA0080005,"\h(《Girl》)Y… yes.
Um… thank you very much.\e"
MA0080006,"\h(《Aika》)Haha… you don't need to thank us!
The Blue Rogues are always there to help people!\e"
MA0080007,"\h(《Aika》)My name is Aika. It's nice to meet you. 
Hey, could you tell us your name?\e"
MA0080008,\h(《Girl》)My name… my name is Fina.\e
MA0080009,"\h(《What will you say?》)“That's a great name.”
“That's a strange name.”
“So, where are you from, exactly?”\e"
MA0080010,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, huh?
It's a great name… it's so… so feminine.\e"
MA0080011,\h(《Fina》)R… really? You think so?\e
MA0080012,"\h(《Vyse》)Geez, you try and compliment someone… And 
nothing… No reaction whatsoever.\e"
MA0080013,"\h(《Aika》)Ahahaha!
Vyse, that wasn't much of a compliment.
Looks like you have a lot to learn about women.\e"
MA0080014,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, huh?
That's a strange name.\e"
MA0080015,"\h(《Fina》)Really?
Oh… I'm sorry…\e"
MA0080016,"\h(《Aika》)That was really smooth, Vyse.
Don't you know how to treat a lady?! Sheesh.\e"
MA0080017,"\h(《Aika》)Didn't Cap'n Dyne teach you that sailors are 
supposed to be gentlemen?!\e"
MA0080018,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, sorry!
I didn't mean any harm.\e"
MA0080019,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina…
So, where are you from, exactly?\e"
MA0080020,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MA0080021,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!
She just woke up! You don't need to start 
interrogating her right away!\e"
MA0080022,\h(《Aika》)See? Now she's scared.\e
MA0080023,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry sorry!
I didn't mean any harm.\e"
MA0080024,"\h(《Fina》)Umm… excuse me, but I have a question.
What exactly is an Air… Air Pirate?\e"
MA0080025,"\h(《Aika》)What? You were out sailing all by yourself and 
you don't even know what Air Pirates are?\e"
MA0080026,"\h(《Fina》)Oh… I…
I'm sorry… it's my first time traveling.\e"
MA0080027,"\h(《Vyse》)Basically, Air Pirates are sailors that attack 
other ships and steal their cargo.\e"
MA0080028,\h(《Fina》)Attack?!\e
MA0080029,"\h(《Aika》)Ahaha… you don't have to worry about us.
We're “Blue Rogues.”\e"
MA0080030,"\h(《Aika》)See, Air Pirates are divided into two factions: 
the Blue Rogues and the Black Pirates.\e"
MA0080031,"\h(《Aika》)The Black Pirates will attack anything in the 
sky… especially merchant vessels and unarmed 
ships.\e"
MA0080032,"\h(《Aika》)However, we Blue Rogues only take cargo from
armed ships, especially the Imperial Armada.\e"
MA0080033,"\h(《Vyse》)We rob from the rich and keep the gold. 
But, we use the gold to save people that need 
our help.\e"
MA0080034,"\h(《Vyse》)That's why we helped you. Don't worry, we aren't
trying to kidnap you or anything. Just relax and
enjoy the trip.\e"
MA0080035,\h(《Fina》)Umm… sure.\e
MA0080036,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, Aika…
How long are you going to sit there 
chitchatting? Come to the bridge now.\e"
MA0080037,"\h(《Aika》)Oh no!
I completely lost track of time!\e"
MA0080038,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh well… I guess that means we have to go.
Alright Fina, we'll see you later!
Try and get some rest.\e"
M00070000,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Oh, there you are, Vyse. You finally decided to
join us on the bridge, huh? Well, we're heading
back home to Pirate Isle.\e"
M00070001,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Pirate Isle is directly east of here. Just
follow the compass and you should be fine.\e"
M00070002,\h(《Vyse》)Directly east? Aye aye!\e
M00070003,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Alright, let's get moving, then.
Full speed ahead to Pirate Isle!\c"
M00070004,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Hey… we haven't reached Pirate Isle yet.
Return to your post.\e"
M00070005,"\h(《What will you say to Briggs?》)“Aye aye!”
“There's something I need to take care of…”\e"
M00070006,"\h(《Vyse》)Umm… I'll be right back. I promise. I have
something that I need to take care of first.\e"
M00070007,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Alright, just go then! I have no idea what
could be so important, but whatever it is,
just do it quickly and hurry back!\c"
M00070008,"\h(《Vyse》)Aye aye!
Alright, let's head back to Pirate Isle!\c"
M00150000,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)When you're at the helm, watch out for “sky
rifts.” They're those really strong downdrafts
that surround Pirate Isle.\e"
M00150001,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)If your engines aren't strong enough and you fly
into them, the wind will push you down into Deep
Sky… the pressure down there would crush us.\c"
M00150002,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)Steer clear of the sky rifts. If you try and
power though them, we'll get sucked into
Deep Sky. But you already knew that, right?\c"
M00170000,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Hey, Vyse…
That raid earlier was pretty good. It's been a
while since we raided a Valuan ship.\e"
M00170001,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)If you're wondering what we did with the
Valuans… Well, when they heard their “fearless
leader” abandoned ship, they surrendered.\e"
M00170002,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne just let them go, though.
Well, AFTER we took their treasure, of course.
And there was a lot of it!\e"
M00170003,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)We'll take what we can, but we only fight when
we need to. That's what separates us Blue
Rogues from the Black Pirates!\c"
M00170004,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)We'll take what we want, but we only fight when
we need to. That's what separates us Blue
Rogues from the Black Pirates!\c"
M00230000,"\h(《Dyne》)You're late, Vyse.
I told you that you need to be on time for your
shift.\e"
M00230001,"\h(《Dyne》)You know the routine. Swab the decks…
And they better be clean.\e"
M00230002,"\h(《Vyse》)But… but Dad!!
I was only a little late!!\e"
M00230003,"\h(《Dyne》)On a ship, being a little late can cost lives.\e"
M00230004,"\h(《Dyne》)And one more thing… while we're on board,
it's not “Dad,” it's “Captain,” got it?\e"
M00230005,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, yeah… I got it.\e"
M00230006,"\h(《Dyne》)We're heading home to Pirate Isle.
Go report to Briggs… See if he needs you
for anything.\c"
M00230007,"\h(《Dyne》)We're heading home to Pirate Isle.
Go report to Briggs for your orders.\c"
M00230008,"\h(《Dyne》)Hey… where are you going? Vyse, you've got work
to do here on the bridge.\c"
Mh0020000,"\h(《Vyse》)Are you feeling any better, Fina?
Oh, and don't worry… you're free to walk
around the ship if you want.\e"
Mh0020001,"\h(《Fina》)Oh, yes. I'm fine.
Thank you for all that you've done for me.\c"
Mh0020002,"\h(《Fina》)Thank you for everything that you've done
for me.\c"
Ms032a000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms032a001,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse! What are you doing?!
Come to the bridge on the double!!\c"
Ms032a002,"\h(《Vyse》)The barrel is stuffed with all sorts of
preserved foods. It's important to eat right,
especially on long voyages.\c"
Ms032a003,"\h(《Vyse》)It's full of ammunition. We're not allowed to
take any without my dad's permission. He's very
strict about things like that.\c"
Ms032a004,"\h(《Vyse》)It's one of the Albatross' main cannons. Not all
of our cannons are attached to the ship… We can
move this one around the ship if we need to.\c"
Ms032a005,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright… Who left this barrel here?
I swear… if my dad finds out, someone's
going to be in big trouble.\c"
Ms032a006,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a map of Mid Ocean…
This area is considered the turf of the
Dyne Family Blue Rogues.\c"
