M01160000,"\h(《Vyse》)There's not even a cusion. Well, I suppose these
beds are meant for prisoners, so there's no
reason for them to make the beds comfortable…\c"
M01160001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's disturbing to think of how many people
probably died in this prison… Or… even… in
this bed…\c"
M01160002,"\h(《Vyse》)The only thing I can see from here is the
dark skies of Valua…\c"
M01160003,"\h(《Vyse》)There's two beds, but…
Where's Fina?\e"
M01160004,"\h(《Aika》)I don't know. They split us up before we even
got here… I've been alone the whole time…
Well, until macho-man came along, that is…\e"
M01160005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the same kind of bed that Gilder and I had.
I guess the Valuans don't believe in treating
ladies like ladies…\c"
M01160006,"\h(《Vyse》)This is probably the area right
above our own cell…\c"
M01160007,"\h(《Vyse》)…Damn. It won't open.
It's locked.\c"
M01160008,\h(　)Used the “Cannon Room Key” to open the door.\c
M01160009,"\h(《An elevator switch…》)“Prisoner Block 200      2nd Floor”
“Fortress Cannon Room   Battery 28”
“Don't get on the elevator.”\c"
M01160010,"\h(《An elevator switch…》)“Prisoner Block 100      1st Floor”
“Fortress Cannon Room   Battery 28”
“Don't get on the elevator.”\c"
M01160011,"\h(《An elevator switch…》)“Prisoner Block 200      2nd Floor”
“Prisoner Block 100      1st Floor”
“Don't get on the elevator.”\c"
M01160012,"\h(《Vyse》)…Nope, it won't open.
The “Cannon Room Key” won't work either.
I guess we need a different key…\c"
M01160013,\h(　)Used the “Harbor Key” to open the door.\c
M01160014,"\h(《Vyse》)Great… This door's locked.
And it doesn't look like there's a keyhole…\e"
M01160015,"\h(《Gilder》)It probably leads towards the center of the
Fortress. I don't know about you, but I'd rather
get out of here than go exploring. Let's go.\c"
M01160016,"\h(《Gilder》)It probably leads towards the center of the
Fortress. We're probably better off not going
that way. Let's look somewhere else.\c"
M01160017,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like I have to step on this tablet
to open the door. I think I just have to stand
here for a certain length of time or something…\c"
M01160018,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh… Good job guys. Looks like my crew is
causing quite a commotion. It should be enough
for us to sneak out of here…\c"
M01160019,"\h(《Vyse》)…Hm?
This switch isn't doing anything.\e"
M01160020,"\h(《Gilder》)This elevator is probably stuck on another floor
or somebody else might already be inside it.
Let's not stick around to find out which, okay?\c"
M01160021,\h(《Aika》)Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!\e
M01160022,\h(《Vyse》)… Hey! That sounded like Aika!!\c
M01160023,"\h(《Vigoro》)Ugh… That hurt, Red…\c"
M01160024,"\h(　)You found the “Harbor Key” in the pocket
of the Valuan Soldier.\c"
