MI0050000,\h(《Fina》)It's so difficult to see…\e
MI0050001,\h(《Aika》)Someone's there!\e
MI0050002,\h(《Fina》)Oh…!\e
MI0050003,\h(《Aika》)I don’t believe it!\e
MI0050004,\h(《Drachma》)…Who's there?!\e
MI0050005,\h(《Vyse》)Drachma?!\e
MI0050006,\h(《Aika》)Cap'n!!!\e
MI0050007,\h(《Drachma》)What're you kids doing here?!\e
MI0050008,"\h(《Aika》)It really is you!
I never thought I'd see you again!\e"
MI0050009,\h(《Drachma》)Yeah… well… uhhh…\e
MI0050010,"\h(《Vyse》)It's been a while, Captain.
Heh… I had a feeling you survived the attack!\e"
MI0050011,"\h(《Fina》)But, Captain…
What are you doing at the bottom of Glacia?\e"
MI0050012,\h(《Drachma》)……\e
MI0060000,\h(《Aika》)What?\e
MI0060001,\h(《Vyse》)No… it's not…\e
MI0060002,"\h(《Vyse》)It is!!!
What's Rhaknam doing here?!\e"
MI0060003,\h(《Drachma》)…Follow me.\e
MI0060004,\h(《Aika》)Is… is he dead?\e
MI0060005,"\h(《Drachma》)No… he's still alive.
But, he was badly wounded by Ramirez's ships.\e"
MI0060006,"\h(《Drachma》)It is a fatal wound.
Rhaknam is dyin'…\e"
MI0060007,"\h(《Drachma》)When Rhaknam fled from Ramirez, I got pulled
along… If I wasn't attached to him, the
Little Jack would have been destroyed.\e"
MI0060008,\h(《Drachma》)This is his… home.\e
MI0060009,"\h(《Vyse》)Captain…
You mean to tell me that you've been alone… 
here… with Rhaknam the whole time?\e"
MI0060010,\h(《Drachma》)Aye.\e
MI0060011,\h(《Enrique》)Is that…?\e
MI0060012,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse!
Look! That light…!\e"
MI0060013,"\h(《Vyse》)What…?
Is… is that the Moon Crystal?!\e"
MI0060014,"\h(《Enrique》)It must be.
Which would mean that… this arcwhale… 
Rhaknam… is the Purple Gigas?\e"
MI0060015,"\h(《Fina》)I can't believe that Rhaknam is 
the Purple Gigas!\e"
MI0060016,\h(《Fina》)The… the name of the Purple Gigas is Plergoth.\e
MI0060017,"\h(《Fina》)According to the legends, the citizens of the 
Purple Civilization implanted the Purple Crystal
into a living creature.\e"
MI0060018,"\h(《Vyse》)Then… that means that Rhaknam 
was once a normal arcwhale?\e"
MI0060019,"\h(《Fina》)Yes. I think after Rhaknam had been transformed
into the Purple Gigas, his master perished… and
he has been wandering the skies ever since.\e"
MI0060020,"\h(《Fina》)So this poor arcwhale was also a victim of the
war.\e"
MI0060021,"\h(《Aika》)But Cap'n…
Why did you stay here all that time?\e"
MI0060022,"\h(《Aika》)If the Little Jack is here with you, why didn't
you leave?\e"
MI0060023,\h(《Drachma》)……\e
MI0060024,"\h(《Drachma》)I've spent my life… searching for Rhaknam
to avenge my crew… and my son… \e"
MI0060025,"\h(《Drachma》)I wasted all those years… 
Rhaknam saved me from Ramirez… \e"
MI0060026,"\h(《Drachma》)I… I just thought that I could watch over him
in his last moments. It's the least 
I could do.\e"
MI0060027,\h(《Vyse》)…\e
MI0070000,\h(《Aika》)Why is he making that noise?\e
MI0070001,\h(《Drachma》)I… I'm not sure.\e
MI0070002,\h(《Drachma》)What's wrong? I'm here for you.\e
MI0070003,\h(《Vyse》)This isn't good.\e
MI0070004,\h(《Aika》)Look… at his eye!\e
MI0070005,\h(《Drachma》)Rhaknam…\e
MI0070006,"\h(《Drachma》)I see…
It's time for you to go…\e"
MI0070007,"\h(《Drachma》)Time for you to join your friends…
Good-bye…\e"
MI0070008,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, no…\e"
MI0070009,\h(《Enrique》)Look… the Crystal!\e
MI0070010,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm sorry, Captain…\e"
MI0070011,\h(　)You received the “Purple Moon Crystal.”\e
