“Leave.”\e"
M04020002,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Ten years ago, when my father was still with us 
and running this store, a war broke out with 
Valua.\e"
M04020003,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)To keep them from being destroyed in the war, my
father hid our merchandise and family treasures
in the city sewer system.\e"
M04020004,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)But the sewer system is a complicated maze. When
my father went back to retrieve our things after
the war… \e"
M04020005,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)…he could not remember where everything was 
hidden. After searching for weeks, he gave up.
I wonder if it is all still down there…\c"
M04020006,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)I think he hid all of it in two chests in the 
sewers, but we have not yet found them.\c"
M04020007,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Farewell! And may the Red Moon always watch over
you!\c"

M04030001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and Sell Items.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M04030002,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Long ago, Valua and Nasr were locked in a 
terrible war. Since then, political relations 
between our two nations have been strained.\e"
M04030003,"\h(《Item Merchant》)However, trade hasn't been affected. Many
Merchants still travel to Valua and use Valuan
trade routes. So we have Valuan goods, too.\e"
M04030004,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Thank you, thank you. Yooooooowwch!! Farewell! \c"
M04040000,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Welcome to the Oasis of the Desert Inn! It is

M04040003,\h(《Innkeeper》)Farewell. May the Red Moon be with you.\c
M04040011,"\h(《Innkeeper》)…Hm?
Hey, you do not have enough money! Come back 
when you do.\c"
M04040004,"\h(《Innkeeper》)When traveling in the desert, you must be very
careful not to push yourself too hard.
Please come again!\c"
M04040005,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Welcome!
Oh, yes, Bellena mentioned you would be coming.
Your room is ready.\e"
M04040006,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M04040007,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Hah hah hah. Ever since Bellena started dancing 
in Maramba, more and more tourists have been 
coming and business has increased three-fold!\e"
M04040008,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Since you are a friend of Bellena's, I will give
you a special rate on your room. Sleep well.\c"
M04040009,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Farewell and may the Red Moon forever light your
path!\e"
M04040010,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Well, we have plenty of vacancies, in case you
change your mind. Please come again.\c"
M04050000,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Hail, sailor. You wish to see the new dancer, 
too?\e"
M04050001,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Bellena's dancing is Maramba's newest star
attraction. You definitely don't want to leave
without seeing her. \c"
M04050002,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)You're lucky… Tonight's the first quiet night 
here since Bellena started. It's usually packed.\e"
M04050003,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)She's some traveling dancer who started here two
or three days ago. But what a piece of luck
she's been for this old tavern!\c"
M04050004,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)This is Bellena's day off. Oh yeah, she left a 
message for you. She wishes you to meet her at 
the port.\e"
M04050005,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)What's your secret? Until now Bellena had 
spurned every invitation she received. Well, 
whatever it is…\c"
M04050006,\h(《Tavernkeep》)Bellena has the day off today.\e
M04050007,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)If you're looking for Bellena, she quit. I still
can't believe she left, though… She used to
bring in so many customers…\e"
M04050008,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)She did leave a message, though. “I decided that
finding out how vast the desert is will have to
wait for another time, handsome.”\e"
M04050009,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)“A sailor must be prepared for any situation. 
But, I underestimated you. I will not a second 
time. Farewell for now… we shall meet again.”\e"
M04050010,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Well, that's all she wrote. I couldn't figure it
out. Do you know what she meant?\c"
M04050011,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)If you're looking for Bellena, she hasn't been 
by since she quit. You think she'd at least say 
hi every once in a while…\c"
M04060000,"\h(《Dancer》)Well, hello, handsome. I don't think I've seen 
you around here before.\e"
M04060001,"\h(《Dancer》)If you've come to rest your weary feet, you've
come to the right place. Make yourself
comfortable and stay awhile.\e"
M04060002,"\h(《What shall I do?》)“That sounds like a great idea!”
“Actually, I'm a little busy right now…”\e"
M04060003,"\h(《Vyse》)That actually sounds like a great idea!
It's been a while since we've had time to
relax…\e"
M04060004,"\h(《Dancer》)Please stay!
Stay as long as you like! Sit down, sit down.\e"
M04060005,"\h(《Vyse》)Actually, we're in a bit of a rush…
I don't think we have time to relax here.\e"
M04060006,"\h(《Dancer》)You know, handsome, here in the desert, we say
that you should always drink water whenever you
can.\e"
M04060007,"\h(《Dancer》)It's important to rest now and then when you're 
traveling. Come on. Stop rushing around and sit 
down, sit down.\c"
M04060008,"\h(《Bellena》)Please stay at the local inn tonight.
I know the owner and she'll give you a
discount…\e"
M04060009,"\h(《Bellena》)Desert travel is not easy. You'll need to get a
good night's sleep first. Meet me at the port
in the morning.\e"
M04070000,"\h(《Love-sick Man》)Those slender legs… that soft, smooth skin…
that silky, red hair… she's poetry in motion…\e"
M04070001,"\h(《Love-sick Man》)The first time I saw her, I knew it was love. I
have come every day just to watch her dance…\c"
M04070002,"\h(《Love-sick Man》)Why does her dancing haunt me like this? I wish
she would just talk to me…\c"
M04070003,\h(《Love-sick Man》)Oh no… You mean I won't get to see her today?\c
M04070004,"\h(《Love-sick Man》)I have even seen her dancing in my dreams
lately…\e"
M04070005,"\h(《Love-sick Man》)I… I just cannot forget her! I do not know what
to do…\c"
M04080000,\h(《Rowdy Sailor》)Hey Bellena! Over here!\e
M04080001,"\h(《Rowdy Sailor》)Hey! Blow off! Can't you see I'm tryin' to watch
the show here?! What? You need a ship?\e"
M04080002,"\h(《Rowdy Sailor》)Heh, sorry kid, but I got plans of my own. See 
that Bellena over there? I'm gonna ask her to 
sail with me tonight. Go find a different ship.\c"
M04080003,"\h(《Rowdy Sailor》)Hur hur hur… Who woulda thought there'd be a 
beautiful girl like her out here in the desert? 
I'm glad I came to Maramba tonight…\c"
M04080004,"\h(《Rowdy Sailor》)Hey Bellena! C'mon out already! We're all 
waitin' for you!\e"
M04080005,"\h(《Rowdy Sailor》)Don't you just hate it how all the pretty women
always play hard to get? Or… maybe it's just
with me… Hm…\c"
M04080006,"\h(《Rowdy Sailor》)If you're wonderin' why I'm still here even 
though Bellena doesn't work here anymore…\e"
M04080007,"\h(《Rowdy Sailor》)…it's 'cuz I've never seen a woman quite like 
her before. And believe me… I've been lookin' 
for a very looooong time.\c"
M04090000,"\h(《Fortune Teller》)Welcome! I am Kalifa, Seer of the Red Moon. I am
the most renowned fortuneteller in all of Nasr.\e"
M04090001,"\h(《Kalifa》)Travelers from across the skies come to me
seeking the knowledge and wisdom of the Moons…\e"
M04090002,"\h(《Kalifa》)There is no future I do not know… no path I 
cannot see. Hark my words and heed them in your 
journey.\e"
M04090003,"\h(《Kalifa》)Welcome. Hear my words and heed them in your
journey.\e"
M04090004,"\h(《Kalifa》)Welcome… hm? You! I have seen your face in my 
dreams…\e"
M04090005,"\h(《Kalifa》)It was a dream in which someone holding a 
“Suiran Blade” beckons me into the sky…\e"
M04090006,"\h(《Kalifa》)Perhaps it was nothing… Do you wish to know of 
your fate?\e"
M04090007,"\h(《Should I have my fortune told?》)“Have my fortune told.”
“Not today.”\e"
M04090008,\h(《Kalifa》)Hmmm…\e
M04090009,\h(《Kalifa》)Haaa!!!\e
M04090010,"\h(《Kalifa》)The Red Moon has spoken! To the east of here 
lies a temple in which a sacred red jewel lies 
buried in the hot sands!\c"
M04090011,"\h(《Kalifa》)The Red Moon has spoken! Where the great winds 
blow is where you will Discover the island with 
a bird's beak!\c"
M04090012,"\h(《Kalifa》)The Red Moon has spoken! Amidst the dark winds, 
there lives a man stranded for many years!\c"
M04090013,"\h(《Kalifa》)The Red Moon has spoken! Far above the city of 
Nasrad, there is a man-made star!\c"
M04090014,"\h(《Kalifa》)Go forth, and seek your fate. And may the Red 
Moon watch over you…\c"
M04090015,"\h(《Kalifa》)I see. If ever you need the guidance of the Red
Moon, do not hesitate to return. I pray for your
safety in your travels…\c"
M04090016,"\h(《Kalifa》)Welcome… hm? You! I have seen your face in my 
dreams…\e"
M04090017,"\h(《Kalifa》)It was a dream in which someone holding a 
“Suiran Blade” beckons me into the sky…\e"
M04090018,\h(《Vyse》)A Suiran Blade? I've got one right here…\e
M04090019,"\h(《Kalifa》)What?! Then perhaps it was you who came to me
in my dreams… It appears that the Red Moon has
decided my fate.\e"
M04090020,"\h(《Kalifa》)I cannot go against the will of the Moon.
I am henceforth at your service.\e"
M04090021,"\h(《Kalifa》)I am Kalifa, Seer of the Red Moon. I am the most
renowned fortuneteller in all of Nasr. There is
no future that I cannot see.\e"
M04090022,\h(　)Kalifa has joined you as a “Merchant.”\c
M04100000,\h(《Dhabu》)Grrfa!\e
M04110000,"\h(《Trainer》)Welcome my friend! Are you planning on crossing 
to the other part of the city? Perhaps you wish 
to ride a Dhabu?\e"
M04110001,"\h(《Trainer》)The sands of the desert are too hot to walk
upon. It's best to take a Dhabu.\e"
M04110002,"\h(《Will you take a Dhabu?》)“Sure, I'll take one.”
“No thanks.”\e"
M04110003,"\h(《Trainer》)Dhabu stands are marked with red poles. You
can dismount from your Dhabu wherever you see
those red poles.\c"
M04110004,"\h(《Trainer》)Alright, but I've warned you… You'll burn your 
feet on the scorching sands if you don't take a 
Dhabu, so I cannot let you outside the fence.\c"
M04120006,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)You are a sailor, are you not? I could tell by 
your smell. Hmph… You sailors are nothing but 
trouble.\e"
M04120007,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)I had a daughter, but she fell in love with this
sailor who drifted into town one day.\e"
M04120008,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)The next thing I knew she ran off with this 
good-for-nothing sailor and left me here to run 
this shop by myself.\e"
M04120009,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)I have not heard from her since. Hrumph. She's 
probably lying dead in a gutter somewhere by 
now.\c"
M04120010,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)I never thought she'd grow up to be the kind of 
girl that would abandon her parents to elope 
with a sailor. Stupid girl.\c"
M04120011,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)I remember you. You were that sailor that came 
in here a little while ago. What is your wish?\e"
M04120012,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)What?! M, my daughter? She's still alive?!\e"
M04120014,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)…Well, good for her. Not that it means anything
to me anymore. She does not expect me to forgive
her and take her back now, does she?\e"
M04120015,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)Hrumph! She's a stupid girl. She is my daughter 
no more. Leave my shop!\c"
M04120016,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)Hrumph! She's a stupid girl. She is my daughter 
no more. Leave my shop!\c"
M04120017,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)You are persistent, I will give you that. What 
is it this time? What? You wish me to taste 
something?\e"
M04120018,\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)But it's... it's a Kabal Skewer!\e
M04120019,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)What? You're telling me that that
good-for-nothing girl who ran away from home
made this Kabal Skewer?\e"
M04120020,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)Y, you expect me to believe that? Hah! Well,
let's at least see what it tastes like.\e"
M04120005,\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)…\e
M04120021,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)No, it's nothing like the Kabal Skewer I make.
The person who made this can't be my daughter…
I taught her better than this…\e"
M04120022,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)It has an odd smell, the seasonings are bland, 
and worst of all, the meat just is not of the 
same quality.\c"
M04120023,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)That Kabal Skewer has an odd smell, the
seasonings are bland, and worst of all, the meat
just isn't of the same quality.\c"
M04120024,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)You're back?! I said you were persistent, but 
this is ridiculous… What? You wish me to taste 
ANOTHER Kabal Skewer?\e"
M04120002,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)Alright, alright… I give in. Let me taste it.\e"
M04120000,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)I, I can't believe it. Th, this tastes exactly
like my Kabal Skewer!\e"
M04120025,"\h(《Aika》)Your daughter says she never once forgot about
the times she spent with you… and she hasn't
forgotten anything you've ever taught her.\e"
M04120026,"\h(《Aika》)And the proof is in that Kabal Skewer. She tried
so hard to make it just like yours. Please…
she's begging for your forgiveness…\e"
M04120003,\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)…\e
M04120027,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)…Tell her that it'll taste even better if she
leaves it on the fire for another 30 seconds.\e"
M04120001,"\h(《Aika》)Huh? What do you mean by that? Are you forgiving
her?\e"
M04120004,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)Yes, you've won me over. I didn't think I could 
ever forgive her, but perhaps I was wrong. 
Perhaps I was at fault, as well…\c"
M04120028,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)You won me over. I didn't think I could ever
forgive her, but perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps I
was at fault somewhere, as well…\c"
M04120029,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)Welcome, sailor. Thank you for all that you have
done for my daughter… and for me…\e"
M04120030,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)That foolish daughter of mine says she's going 
to start making Kabal Skewers for her tavern in
Esparanza.\e"
M04120031,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)So if you're ever in Esparanza, stop by for one 
of my daughter's Kabal Skewers.\c"
M04120032,"\h(《Kabal Skewer Lady》)So if you're ever in Esparanza, stop by for one 
of my daughter's Kabal Skewers.\c"
M04130000,\h(《Dhabu》)Grrfa!\e
M04140000,"\h(《Trader》)Welcome, travelers, to the beautiful and
ever-warm lands of Nasr!\e"
M04140001,"\h(《Trader》)Enjoy Maramba, the oasis of the desert. And fear
not while you are here, the Red Moon watches
over us all in the lands of Nasr!\e"
M04140002,\h(《Vyse》)Thanks. I feel welcome already.\e
M04140003,"\h(《Trader》)The warmth of the Moon warms our hearts here in
Nasr. I wish only to share with you that which
I have been blessed with myself.\e"
M04140004,"\h(《Trader》)Welcome, travelers, to the beautiful and
ever-warm lands of Nasr!\e"
M04140005,"\h(《Trader》)Hello there! Perhaps you've heard of this news
already, but I recently spoke with a merchant
from Valua and he told me something interesting.\e"
M04140006,"\h(《Trader》)Apparently there's a vast green continent beyond
the South Ocean that's covered by a deep forest.\e"
M04140007,"\h(《Trader》)Of course, there've long been rumors about such
a place. Sailors have spoken of strange leaves
that are carried in the winds from the south…\e"
M04140008,"\h(《Trader》)Apparently there's a vast green continent beyond
the South Ocean that's covered by a deep 
forest.\c"
M04140009,"\h(《Trader》)Hello there! You seem well-traveled enough to
know this, but I have heard rumors of a land
covered completely in ice south of South Ocean.\e"
M04140010,"\h(《Trader》)Here in Nasr, we almost never see ice at all.
It's hard to imagine an entire continent covered
in ice.\e"
M04140011,"\h(《Trader》)Just think of the money you could make if you
could bring all that ice back to Nasr!\e"
M04140012,"\h(《Trader》)I have heard rumors of a land covered completely
in ice south of South Ocean.\e"
M04140013,"\h(《Trader》)Recently, there's been an increase in trade 
caravans to Esparanza.\e"
M04140014,"\h(《Trader》)In fact, not so long ago, I made the trip
myself, and I was surprised at how lively the
market there was.\e"
M04140015,"\h(《Trader》)They need much material to rebuild their city, 
so I think they'll make great trading partners.\e"
M04140016,"\h(《Trader》)Come to think of it, a young lady I saw in a
tavern there said she was born in this city.\c"
M04140017,"\h(《Trader》)Come to think of it, a young lady I saw in a
tavern there said she was born in this city.\c"
M04140018,"\h(《Trader》)Hello! I noticed that there haven't been any 
trade ships from Valua coming here in a while. 
Did something happen?\e"
M04140019,"\h(《Trader》)What?! Valua was destroyed by the Rains of 
Destruction? Is it really so? I always thought 
of the Rains of Destruction as legend.\c"
M04140020,"\h(《Trader》)Is it true that the Rains of Destruction fell 
upon Valua?\c"
M04150000,"\h(《Young Maiden》)In the desert, water is life. That is why we
must carry water every day from the well.\e"
M04150001,"\h(《Young Maiden》)There is a well in the other part of the city,
but it has been dry for a long time now.\c"
M04150002,"\h(《Young Maiden》)There is a well in the other part of the city,
but it has been dry for a long time now.\c"
M04150003,"\h(《Young Maiden》)Esparanza is a town on the southern edge of this
continent. I understand that it was once a
flourishing city… \e"
M04150004,"\h(《Young Maiden》)But there is a sky rift between us, so you
cannot reach it by ship.\e"
M04150005,"\h(《Young Maiden》)In olden days, Dhabu caravans plied the route
over the mountains, but I have not heard of any
caravans traveling that way lately. \c"
M04150006,"\h(《Young Maiden》)Esparanza is a town on the southern edge of this
continent. There is a sky rift between us, so
you cannot reach it by ship. \c"
M04150007,"\h(《Young Maiden》)The other day I saw a caravan from Esparanza for
the first time in ages.\e"
M04150008,"\h(《Young Maiden》)I have heard rumors of an oasis somewhere along
the finger of desert that leads to Esparanza.\e"
M04150009,"\h(《Young Maiden》)If you find it, you should visit the Sailors'
Guild. I am sure that they will pay you well for
such valuable information. \c"
M04150010,"\h(《Young Maiden》)If you find the oasis, you should visit the
Sailors' Guild.\c"
M04160000,"\h(《Boy》)My dad's a merchant! My grandpa was a merchant!
And my great-grandpa was a merchant, too!\e"
M04160001,"\h(《Boy》)I'm going to become a merchant and travel the
desert on a Dhabu, just like everyone else in
my family!\c"
M04160002,"\h(《Boy》)Nasrad's really going through some tough times!
Nasrad burned to the ground! Nasrad suffers from
shortages of every kind!\e"
M04160003,"\h(《Boy》)It's the perfect chance to make lots and lots of
money! My dad's all excited about it!\c"
M04160004,"\h(《Boy》)Valua's really going through some tough times! 
Valua was hit by the Rains of Destruction! 
Valuan goods are so expensive now!\e"
M04160005,"\h(《Boy》)It's the perfect chance to make lots and lots of
money! My dad's all excited about it! …But what
are the Rains of Destruction?\c"
M04170000,\h(《Village Elder》)And one… and two… and one… and two…\e
M04170001,"\h(《Village Elder》)Welcome, traveler! Here, here, young desert
traveler. Stay a moment and listen to what I
have to tell you!\e"
M04170002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay and listen.”
“Make an excuse and hurry on.”\e"
M04170003,"\h(《Village Elder》)I've spent more than half of my lifetime at war
with Valua!\e"
M04170004,"\h(《Village Elder》)The Nasultan, our king, charged me with leading
his fleet in an attack on the Valuan mainland.\e"
M04170005,"\h(《Village Elder》)But those yellow-bellied Valuans hid within 
their Grand Fortress and refused to come out.\e"
M04170006,"\h(《Village Elder》)That's why I'm working out, so that one day I 
can break through the gate of the Grand Fortress
myself!\c"
M04170007,"\h(《Village Elder》)That's the problem with young people today!
Don't they know they should listen to what their
elders have to say?\e"
M04170008,\h(《Village Elder》)And one… and two… and one… and two…\e
M04170009,"\h(《Village Elder》)I understand that Nasr's capital, Nasrad, was
destroyed by the Valuans! Stay a moment and
listen to what I have to tell you!\e"
M04170010,"\h(《Hmm, should I?》)“Stay and listen.”
“Make an excuse and hurry on.”\e"
M04170011,"\h(《Village Elder》)Did I ever tell you about how I fought with the
Nasr forces against Valua?\e"
M04170012,"\h(《Village Elder》)I remember the Valuan fleet had this admiral…
although he was still relatively young,
he was sharp as a Dhabu's tooth!\e"
M04170013,"\h(《Village Elder》)He was bold but also cautious. Whether mounting
a frontal assault or surprise attack,
he was a true master of strategy.\e"
M04170014,"\h(《Village Elder》)I think his name was Galcian, and I understand
he now commands the entire Armada!\e"
M04170015,"\h(《Village Elder》)With a man like that in command of the Armada,
it's no surprise that our capital fell so
easily.\e"
M04170016,"\h(《Village Elder》)That's the problem with young people today!
Don't they know they should listen to what their
elders have to say?\e"
Ms008a000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a well. It must be rare to find a place
where you can dig a well here. That's probably
why this town can survive this harsh weather.\c"
Ms008a001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a jar. I suppose it's for drawing water
from the well. It looks completely dry… it
probably dries quickly in this heat.\c"
Ms008a002,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a really heavy door… I don't think I'll
be able to move this thing with just my
strength alone…\c"
Ms008a003,"\h(《Vyse》)This must be a feeding station for the Dhabu.
Man! What do they feed them?!
It stinks over here!!\c"
Ms008a004,"\h(　)Dhabu Stand
Please hail the trainer.\c"
Ms008a005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's some sort of ruins…

coming up from below.\c"

Ms008a007,"\h(《Vyse》)“Dhabus like to be clean.
After any long journey,
remember to let them bathe in water.”\c"
Ms008a008,\h(《Vyse》)“Dhabu Rider's Club Newsletter”\e
Ms008a009,"\h(《Vyse》)“Dhabus love sweet fruit. Try mixing some in
with their food. But be careful, Dhabus are
known to run away if the fruit isn't ripe.”\c"

I can't get through!\c"
Ms008a013,\h(　)You received ＊＊＊＊!\c
Ms008a014,"\h(《Vyse》)Spears, bows, cudgels… All sorts of weaponry.
But, to be honest… I prefer using a swords over
anything else.\c"
Ms008a015,"\h(《Vyse》)They're using quite a few Red Moon Stones to
create those intense flames. Maybe that's the
secret to roasting them just right.\c"
Ms008a016,"\h(《Vyse》)Ah, spices. I can't quite place the smell, but
it's rather pungent. And yet, sweet, somehow…\c"

Ms008a019,"\h(《Vyse》)There's some Relik Loqua in here.
I guess the people here like their
loqua spicy.\c"
Ms008a020,"\h(《Vyse》)It's filled with loqua. Yikes! They put some
sort of insect in the bottle! It gives me
shivers all over just thinking about the taste…\c"
Ms008a021,"\h(《Vyse》)Smoked Kabal meat… It smells like it's seasoned
with Khale. It looks pretty spicy, but it's sure
got my mouth watering.\c"
Ms008a022,"\h(《Vyse》)Ugh! What's this smell?!
I've never smelled anything so strong before…\c"
Ms008a023,"\h(《Vyse》)Ack! I saw something moving inside. D, don't
tell me this is food… I think I'll just pretend
I didn't see anything.\c"
Ms008a024,"\h(《Vyse》)It contains a very strange-looking, slimy pink
liquid. I wonder what it could be for?\c"
Ms008a025,"\h(《Vyse》)There's some incense burning. The sweet scent in
the air is so thick it's nearly choking me.\c"
MD0030000,"\h(《Dancer》)Why, hello there, handsome.
I've never seen you around here before.\e"
MD0030001,"\h(《Dancer》)You must be tired.
Sit down and stay a while.\e"
MD0030002,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Sure!”
“We're a little busy right now…”\e"
MD0030003,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure!
I suppose we could use some rest.\e"
MD0030004,"\h(《Dancer》)Great! Sit back and enjoy the show. 
I hope you like what you see.\e"
MD0030005,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm…
We're a little busy right now…\e"
MD0030006,"\h(《Dancer》)There is a saying here in Maramba,
“Drink water whenever you get the chance.”\e"
MD0030007,"\h(《Dancer》)You never know whenever you'll get another
chance to relax.
I suggest that you take it easy while you can.\e"
MD0030008,"\h(《Aika》)Oh…
In Nasr, I guess they just sit on the ground. \e"
MD0030009,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, it feels good to finally sit down.\e"
MD0030010,"\h(《Aika》)Well, we shouldn't rest too long, we gotta go
look for a ship. I wonder where we can find one.
Maybe we should try the docks.\e"
MD0030011,"\h(《Aika》)I can't believe that Cap'n Drachma just left us
here…\e"
MD0030012,"\h(《Aika》)I'm sure he had his reasons to leave, but I wish
he said something sooner. He didn't have to
leave us here in the desert, right Vyse?\e"
MD0030013,\h(《Vyse》)……\e
MD0030014,\h(《Aika》)… Vyse?\e
MD0030015,\h(《Aika》)……\e
MD0030016,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!!!
Have you heard a single word I've said?!\e"
MD0030017,"\h(《Vyse》)Um…
Y… yeah. I'm listening… 
You were talking about the desert.\e"
MD0030018,"\h(《Aika》)You're acting like you've never seen a girl
before… If you could pry your eyes away from
that dancer for a few seconds…\e"
MD0030019,"\h(《What do you say?》)“Hehe… Okay, I'll stop staring.”
“I have no idea what you're talking about…”\e"
MD0030020,"\h(《Vyse》)Okay, okay. It's just that she's such a good
dancer… I didn't want to insult her by uh…
looking away. New lands, new customs y'know.\e"
MD0030021,"\h(《Aika》)What kind of excuse was that!? You're undressing
her with your eyes, not that it would take that
long. You weren't zooming in, were you?\e"
MD0030022,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But, seriously… don't you
think she's looked over here more than just a
few times? I think she likes me.\e"
MD0030023,\h(《Vyse》)I have no idea what you're talking about…\e
MD0030024,"\h(《Aika》)I swear…
The second a beautiful girl walks into the room,
you turn into a babbling idiot.\e"
MD0030025,"\h(《Vyse》)But, hey… I've caught her looking at me more
than a few times. I think she likes me.\e"
MD0030026,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah, right.
Fina, will you try and talk some sense into him?\e"
MD0030027,\h(《Fina》)… Do you really find it that hard to believe?\e
MD0030028,"\h(《Fina》)Well, Vyse is very attractive…
I don't think it would be strange at all if
that dancer was looking at him.\e"
MD0030029,"\h(《Aika》)Haha… You're kidding right? 
Vyse wouldn't want someone like her… I mean…
Who knows where she's been?\e"
MD0030030,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, umm… I, so umm… Do you travel a lot?\e"
MD0030031,"\h(《Dancer》)Tell me something… You wouldn't happen to be
the group of Air Pirates that escaped from
the Grand Fortress now, would you?\e"
MD0030032,"\h(《Vyse》)Huh?!
How did you know about that?\e"
MD0030033,"\h(《Dancer》)Well, if you hang out in places like this,
you overhear all kinds of things… rumors,
local gossip, news about the other lands…\e"
MD0030034,"\h(《Dancer》)… you even hear stories about Air Pirates
needing a ship.\e"
MD0030035,"\h(《Dancer》)If you want, I can give you a lift.
What do you say?\e"
MD0030036,"\h(《Vyse》)Really?!
Thanks! That'll help us a lot!\e"
MD0030037,"\h(《Aika》)Wait a second.
Why would you help us?
You don't even know who we are.\e"
MD0030038,"\h(《Dancer》)Let's just say that anyone who can escape from
the Valuan Grand Fortress, interests me.\e"
MD0030039,"\h(《Dancer》)My name is Bellena. I'll begin making
preparations. Meet me at the port first thing
tomorrow morning. See you around, handsome.\e"
