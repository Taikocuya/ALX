M01270000,"\h(《Vyse》)So this is the world beneath the clouds…
It's kinda creepy…\e"
M01270001,"\h(《Enrique》)The surface is covered with a thick layer
of mud. Fina's ship is probably stuck in
it somewhere.\e"
M01270002,"\h(《Aika》)How are we supposed to look for Fina's ship
down here? It could be anywhere!\e"
M01270003,"\h(《Enrique》)Don't worry. Brabham told me before we left that
he installed something he called “Moon Stone
Sonar” into the Delphinus.\e"
M01270004,"\h(《Enrique》)It's a device that uses the energy from Moon
Stones to detect physical objects. You can use
it by pressing the B button.\e"
M01270005,"\h(《Enrique》)Once you press the button, the sonar will send
out a wave of energy. If it detects anything,
a “?” will appear on the map.\e"
M01270006,"\h(《Enrique》)But, if it doesn't find anything, nothing will
happen.\e"
M01270007,"\h(《Enrique》)You'll need to send out a few sonar waves as we
move around in order to try and pinpoint where
the object is.\e"
M01270008,"\h(《Enrique》)Then, once we've narrowed the location down,
press the A button to lower the crane.\e"
M01270009,"\h(《Enrique》)If there's something under the mud,
the crane should pull it out.\e"
M01270010,"\h(《Vyse》)I see…
Find it with the sonar,
then pull it out with the crane, huh?\e"
M01270011,"\h(《Enrique》)The sonar uses a lot of energy,
so we can only use it 10 times.\e"
M01270012,"\h(《Enrique》)But if we go back above the clouds, we can
recharge the sonar to be able to use it for
10 more tries.\e"
M01270013,"\h(《Aika》)So if we run out of sonar charges,
we just go back up, huh?
Okay, let's start searching!\c"
M01270014,\h(　)…Grrrrrr!\e
M01270015,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, no!
The crane grabbed some kind of
strange creature!\e"
M01270016,"\h(《Vyse》)I must've searched in the wrong place!
Battlestations, everyone! It looks like it's
going to attack!!!\c"
M01270017,\h(　)…Grrrrrr!\e
M01270018,"\h(《Aika》)Oh no, not again!\e"
M01270019,"\h(《Vyse》)We're going to get attacked again!
Battlestations, everyone!\c"
M01270020,\h(　)…Grrrrrr!\e
M01270021,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! You idiot!!!
I can't believe this!
Don't you know how to use that thing?!\e"
M01270022,"\h(《Vyse》)Great, looks like this wasn't the right place,
either… Well, you all know the routine…
Battlestations…\c"
M01270023,\h(　)…Grrrrrr!\e
M01270024,"\h(《Aika》)Come on, Vyse!
I'm getting tired of this!
Maybe I should be captain!\e"
M01270025,"\h(《Vyse》)S, sorry Aika.
Hate to put you all through this again, but…
battlestations, everyone.\c"
M01270026,\h(　)…Grrrrrr!\e
M01270027,\h(《Aika》)…………………\e
M01270028,"\h(《Vyse》)Um…
Sorry… um… well… yeah.
Battlestations…… Please?\c"
M01270029,\h(　)You received 1 piece of “Velorium.”\c
M01270030,\h(　)You received 1 piece of “Velorium.”\c
MJ0140000,\h(《Aika》)The crane grabbed onto something!\e
MJ0140001,\h(《Vyse》)Pull it up!\e
MJ0140002,"\h(《Aika》)We did it!!!
It's Fina's ship!\e"
MJ0140003,"\h(《Vyse》)Great job!
Aika, hurry and get it on board!\e"
MJ0140004,\h(《Aika》)Aye aye!\e
MJ0140005,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, you'll finally be able to get home with
this!\e"
MJ0140006,"\h(《Fina》)Yes.
Thank you very much.\e"
MJ0140007,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MJ0140008,\h(《Fina》)This means that I'll have to leave you…\e
MJ0140009,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, Fina… I…\e"
MJ0140010,"\h(《Vyse》)Aaahh!
What was that?!\e"
MJ0140011,\h(《Aika》)There was an explosion off the port bow!\e
MJ0140012,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!
Something's coming!\e"
MJ0140013,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehehe…
I found you, Vyse!\e"
MJ0140014,"\h(《De Loco》)I still haven't forgotten what you did to 
my ship, the Chameleon, at Ixa'taka!\e"
MJ0140015,"\h(《De Loco》)This underworld will be your grave!
I shall have my revenge!
REVENGE!!!\e"
MJ0140016,"\h(《Vyse》)That was the ship that De Loco was building at
Dangral.\e"
MJ0140017,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika, did you secure Fina's ship?\e"
MJ0140018,\h(《Aika》)Yes. It's onboard already.\e
MJ0140019,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright! All hands to battlestations!
Here is our chance to finally rid the world of
that psycho!\e"
MJ0140020,"\h(《Vyse》)Visibility is poor, so it'll be hard to hit him
when he's far away! Try and attack from close
range!\e"
MJ0180000,"\h(《De Loco》)No! No! NO! How… how could the Chameleon be 
defeated three times?! Not one time, not two 
times, but THREE TIMES!!!\e"
MJ0180001,"\h(《De Loco》)This can't be! This can't be!
This is all just a dream! Just an illusion!
I… I refuse to believe it!\e"
MJ0180002,"\h(《Vice Captain》)Admiral!
Get a hold of yourself!\e"
MJ0180003,\h(《De Loco》)……\e
MJ0180004,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehe…
Hehehehe…\e"
MJ0180005,"\h(《Vice Captain》)Admiral?
Are you alright?\e"
MJ0180006,"\h(《De Loco》)MWAHAHAHA!!!
This time, dear little Vyse, I've prepared 
something special just for you!\e"
MJ0180007,"\h(《De Loco》)It's not over yet, Vyse!
I still have one last trick up my sleeve!!!\e"
MJ0180008,\h(《De Loco》)Fire the De Loco Harpoon Cannon!!!\e
MJ0180009,\h(《Vyse》)What was that?!!!\e
MJ0180010,"\h(《De Loco》)Mwahahahaha!!!
I shall defeat you with a Harpoon Cannon, 
just like you defeated me!!!\e"
MJ0180011,"\h(《De Loco》)I'll get you this time, Vyse!
I'll get you!
I'll get you!\e"
MJ0190000,"\h(《De Loco》)Aahhhh!!
Hot! Hot! Hot!\e"
MJ0190001,"\h(《De Loco》)Somebody help me!!!
Somebody tell me this is just a bad dream!!\e"
MJ0190002,\h(《Aika》)It looks like that's the end of bubble head…\e
MJ0190003,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah… but that was a tough fight. 
If we took on too much damage, 
we would have been stuck down here.\e"
MJ0190004,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we retrieved Fina's ship… 
Let's go back up! This place 
gives me the creeps!\e"
