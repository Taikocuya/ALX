MI0120001,"\h(《Fina》)That is Yeligar, the Yellow Gigas.\e"
MI0120002,\h(《Vyse》)Hrmph…\e
MI0120003,"\h(《Fina》)Silvite Mages managed to put him to sleep. Then
they sealed him in here. Yeligar is extremely
powerful, so it's best that we don't wake him.\e"
MI0120004,"\h(《Fina》)The Crystal is in Yeligar's possession. We have
to find a way to remove it, without waking him.\e"
MI0120005,"\h(《Vyse》)Great…
He's awake!\e"
MI0120006,"\h(《Vyse》)If we stay here, we won’t be able to dodge 
the lightning! We have to get away from him! 
Engines, Full Reverse!\e"
MI0120007,\h(《Aika》)This is bad.\e
MI0120008,"\h(《Fina》)He made breaking the seal look easy. 
This isn't a good sign…\e"
MI0120009,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like we're going to have to fight him
to get the Crystal.\e"
MI0120010,"\h(《Vyse》)Battlestations!
Let's take that thing down!\e"
