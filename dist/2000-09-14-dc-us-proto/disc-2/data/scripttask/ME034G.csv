Ms034a008,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the emblem of the Valuan royal family.
Heh… I think it's time to cover it up with the
flag of the Blue Rogues!\c"
Ms034a009,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the flag that I designed…
I always wondered if I'd ever get to be the
captain of my own ship since I was a kid…\c"
Ms034a010,"\h(《Vyse》)This is our new flag. Heh… Leave it to Aika to
design a flag like this.\c"
Ms034a011,"\h(《Vyse》)This is our new flag. Fina's just makes me think
of flying freely through the skies… It's a
refreshing feeling.\c"
Ms034a012,"\h(《Vyse》)This is where Marco snuck aboard the Delphinus.
Heh… Maybe that kid is cut out to be an Air
Pirate after all…\c"
Ms034a013,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the captain's chair. I guess that means
it's mine… I'd rather be at the helm, though. I
wouldn't feel right just sitting here.\c"
Ms034a014,"\h(《Vyse》)There sure didn't spare any expenses building
this thing. All of the gauges are brand new.
Well, it WAS meant for the prince, I suppose…\c"
Ms034a015,"\h(《Giler》)Hey, Vyse… Before we set sail, there was
something that I wanted to talk to you about.\c"
Ms034a016,"\h(《Vyse》)Well… I suppose it's about time
we set sail again…\e"
Ms034a017,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ms034a018,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright!
Delphinus, full speed ahead!\c"
Ms034a019,"\h(《Vyse》)Actually, now that I think about it, there
were a few more things I wanted to take care
of first…\c"
Ms034a020,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\c"
Ms034a021,"\h(《Vyse》)It's too dangerous to try and maneuver while
the enemy's ship is latched onto ours…
I need to get out on deck first!\c"
M01110000,"\h(《Lawrence》)Damn… the ship has taken a lot of damage. 
Captain, I think I can fix it. Do you want to 
take the wheel for now?\e"
M01110001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
M01110002,"\h(《Lawrence》)Very well. I leave the ship in your hands.
Be careful.\c"
M01110003,"\h(《Lawrence》)Very well. But do not waste time. I need to fix 
the ship as soon as possible.\c"
M01110004,"\h(《Lawrence》)I'll take care of business in here. You need to 
get yourself on deck.\c"
M01140000,"\h(《Pinta》)No matter how much I fix, there's always more! 
This isn't good…\c"
M05100000,"\h(《Hans》)The ship has taken a lot of damage, Captain!
She'll hold up for a little while, but we should
fix the damage as soon as possible!\c"
M07060000,"\h(《Don》)Heh… She's taken quite a beating. Captain,
hurry up and fix the ship, will ya?\c"
M07060001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\c"
M07060002,"\h(《Don》)Good! Be careful, though… The Delphinus has 
taken quite a bit of damage…\c"
M07060003,"\h(《Don》)Alright. The ship'll hold up for a little while
longer. But you really need to repair the damage
soon.\c"
M08070000,\h(《Moegi》)\eCough cough\e I can't get the fire out!We're… we're going to crash if this keeps up!\c
M14000000,"\h(《Brabham》)Shiver me timbers, Captain! We've taken too much
damage! We should stop with the fightin'…
and start with the fixin'.\c"
Mp0010000,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, Vyse! Quit wasting time and fix the ship 
already!\c"
Mp0020000,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse!
The ship has taken too much damage!
Please, we must repair the ship soon!\c"
