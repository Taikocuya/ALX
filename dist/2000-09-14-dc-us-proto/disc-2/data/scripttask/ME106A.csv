MC0080000,"\h(《Marco》)Wait, Vyse!\e"
MC0080001,"\h(《Vyse》)Marco… you followed us?
What's wrong?\e"
MC0080002,"\h(《Marco》)Vyse…
Don't go… please…\e"
MC0080003,"\h(《Marco》)My… my mother… and father… were both killed
by Valuan soldiers while they were trying to
escape from this city!\e"
MC0080004,"\h(《Marco》)There's no way out!
Trying to get through the Grand Fortress… 
It's impossible!\e"
MC0080005,"\h(《Marco》)No one has ever escaped from Valua! 
You're gonna die this time! 
I just know it!\e"
MC0080006,"\h(《Vyse》)Your parents…
I'm… I'm sorry to hear that, Marco.\e"
MC0080007,"\h(《Vyse》)But, I have to go… I don't have a choice. And 
every time I hear the word “impossible”… it 
makes me want to prove everyone wrong.\e"
MC0080008,"\h(《Vyse》)A long time ago, a handful of sailors took a 
small boat out into uncharted skies.\e"
MC0080009,"\h(《Vyse》)They had no idea what they would find…
Monsters… a maelstrom… the end of the world…\e"
MC0080010,"\h(《Vyse》)It was because these sailors challenged the
unknown, that new lands were discovered.\e"
MC0080011,"\h(《Vyse》)If we challenge ourselves, and never give up,
our own horizons will broaden… in our hearts,
and in our minds…\e"
MC0080012,"\h(《Vyse》)I need to push myself every day. I have to know 
what I can accomplish… I never give up, and so 
far, nothing has ever stopped me.\e"
MC0080013,\h(《Marco》)But… but… Vyse…\e
MC0080014,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't worry about me.
I believe that we'll make it out… I will find a
way… that's what's keeping me going.\e"
MC0080015,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm going to prove that it's not impossible to 
escape. Impossible is just a word to let people 
feel good about themselves when they quit.\e"
MC0080016,\h(《Marco》)……\e
MC0080017,"\h(《Marco》)Vyse…
Do you think I could ever be a sailor?
If I could ever… sail the skies?\e"
MC0080018,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh, of course! You've got what it takes…
I'll be waiting for you… out there!\e"
MC0080019,\h(《Marco》)Thank you…\e
M01060000,"\h(《Marco》)Hey… You really did it. You rescued your
friends. I can't believe it. You really are
something…\e"
M01060001,"\h(《Vyse》)Marco!
What are you doing here?\e"
M01060002,"\h(《Marco》)I told you before, right? I live here.
I know everything about these sewers.\e"
M01060003,"\h(《Marco》)This wall was built with a secret door.
I took your friends into the secret room just
behind me.\c"
M01060004,"\h(《Marco》)Your friends are waiting in the room right
behind me. Hurry up before the guards get smart
and come looking through this area.\c"
M01060005,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Alright, we managed to get out of the Coliseum,
but now what? We still have to get out of Valua.
And that's no easy task by any measure.\c"
M01060006,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Heh… It's been a while since I've had so much
fun! How often do we get to pound on Valuans in
their own country?\c"
M01060007,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)When they were moving us, they put us on some
sort of rail car. I've never seen anything like
that before in my whole life.\e"
M01060008,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)They got these metal boxes all lined up
one after the other, like some big, long
bug… That's one strange way to get places.\c"
M01060009,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)I can't believe you actually did it, Vyse!
You showed those Valuans a thing or two!
Haha… You were great!\c"
M01060010,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)You never cease to amaze me.
I never would have thought
I'd see you here.\e"
M01060011,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)But I'm glad you showed up.
We all owe you one.\c"
M01060012,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)There are no signs of anyone following us. But,
it's probably just a matter of time before they
find this place, too.\e"
M01060013,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)Now we just have to try and figure a way to get
out of Valua. Heh… Easier said than done, I
suppose. But, we've made it this far, at least…\c"
M01060014,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse! What are you doing? We need to decide on
some sort of plan here! Everyone's lives are at
stake! Don't go wandering around!\c"
M01060015,"\h(《Vyse》)… Hm? Is it just me, or is the color of
the wall here a little different from
everywhere else? It's probably nothing.\c"
M01060016,"\h(《Vyse》)This is where the secret door that led to Upper
City was, but it won't budge.\e"
M01060017,"\h(《Vyse》)Marco is probably the only person who knows how
to open it. Oh well… I guess there isn't much I
can do.\c"
M01060020,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like this ladder leads straight up into
the Coloseum…\e"
M01060021,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Break into the Coloseum!”
“Finish up some preparations first.”\c"
M01060018,"\h(《Vyse》)The Coloseum is in a state of confusion right
now. We really need to get everyone out of here
while we have the chance.\c"
M01060019,"\h(《Vyse》)The Coloseum is probably crawling with guards.
I'd rather not get caught right now, so it's
probably better not to climb up the ladder.\c"
