ME0170000,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it looks like the Crystal is probably
sealed in here…\e"
ME0170001,"\h(《Aika》)Hey everyone… Look over here!
The person on this wall looks like Fina!\e"
ME0170002,"\h(《Vyse》)You're right…
I wonder if this is that “Quetya” the villagers
were talking about…\e"
ME0170003,"\h(《Fina》)“We, who have come from the Temple of the
Silver Moon…”\e"
ME0170004,\h(《Vyse》)… Fina?\e
ME0170005,"\h(《Fina》)“We, who have come from the Temple of the
Silver Moon…”\e"
ME0170006,"\h(《Fina》)“have sealed within the forests, after the Rains
of Destruction washed away the lands, the
unsleeping giant, Grendel…”\e"
ME0170007,"\h(《Fina》)“And upon his sealing, the Green Crystal was
kept within these walls…”\e"
ME0170008,"\h(《Fina》)This is written in the holy language of the
Silver Temple. The Silvites must have inscribed
these words when they were here.\e"
ME0170009,"\h(《Vyse》)These are the ruins of Ixa'taka, right?
Why would Silvites come here?\e"
ME0170010,"\h(《Fina》)The Rains of Destruction nearly destroyed the
Green Civilization.\e"
ME0170011,"\h(《Fina》)But even after the Rains fell, Grendel still
terrorized the lands for many generations to
follow. The Silvites came here to contain him.\e"
ME0170012,"\h(《Fina》)But they came too late. The Green Civilization
was destroyed and the people were reduced to a
few primitive tribes of scavengers.\e"
ME0170013,"\h(《Drachma》)The people from that village probably thought
the Silvites were Gods because they were able
to contain Grendel.\e"
ME0170014,"\h(《Aika》)It all makes sense now… That's why they thought
Fina was one of the “Quetya”.\e"
ME0170015,"\h(《Vyse》)But… it says the Green Crystal is kept 
within these walls, right?\e"
ME0170016,"\h(《Vyse》)But I don't see the Crystal anywhere. 
I wonder where it is…\e"
ME0170017,\h(《Fina》)You're right… it should be here.\e
ME0170018,\h(《Drachma》)Who's there?!\e
ME0170019,"\h(《Drachma》)Don't let him get away!
He might have the Crystal!\e"
ME0280000,\h(《Vyse》)What's that rumbling sound?\e
ME0280001,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, no… not again!!!\e"
ME0280002,\h(《Fina》)Someone is summoning Grendel!\e
ME0290000,"\h(《Fina》)Why would they awaken him?
Don't they understand that the entire Valuan
Armada will retaliate against them?\e"
ME0290001,"\h(《Vyse》)Everyone! Back to the Little Jack!
We have to stop that thing!\e"
ME0300000,\h(《Aika》)So this is the “ghost”…\e
ME0300001,"\h(《Drachma》)Who are you?
And why are you following us?\e"
ME0300002,"\h(《High Priest》)Please don't kill me!!!
I'm a High Priest of Ixa'taka!\e"
ME0300003,"\h(《Vyse》)A High Priest?
So you followed us all the way from Horteka?\e"
ME0300004,"\h(《High Priest》)No… I didn't follow you.
I… I've been here… for a long time.
It is my duty to guard these ruins.\e"
ME0300005,"\h(《High Priest》)If anyone tries to loot what's in these ruins, 
or steal the Sacred Green Stone, 
I contact King Ixa'taka.\e"
ME0300006,"\h(《Aika》)Wait a minute… you mean to tell me that the
king knew where the Lost City was all
this time?\e"
ME0300007,"\h(《High Priest》)Yes.
We figured out Isapa's riddle… 
and we found Rixis.\e"
ME0300008,"\h(《High Priest》)And here, we found the Sacred Green Stone. The 
king and Isapa were very happy, because we 
could use the Stone to stop the Valuans.\e"
ME0300009,"\h(《Fina》)Stop the Valuans?
You aren't going to…\e"
ME0300010,\h(《High Priest》)……\e
ME0300011,"\h(《Drachma》)Tell us!
Or do you want me to crack your skull?\e"
ME0300012,"\h(《High Priest》)Alright, alright!
I'll tell you!\e"
ME0300013,"\h(《High Priest》)The king and Isapa said that the Sacred Green
Stone had the power to awaken the Giant.\e"
ME0300014,"\h(《High Priest》)If the Giant were to come, he would chase the
Valuans back to the eastern skies and we would
be safe.\e"
ME0300015,\h(《Vyse》)What?!\e
M01120000,"\h(《Fina》)“We, who have come from the
Temple of the Silver Moon…”\e"
M01120001,"\h(《Fina》)“… have sealed within the forests, after the
Rains of Destruction washed away the lands,
the unsleeping giant, Grendel…”\e"
M01120002,"\h(《Fina》)“And upon his sealing, the Green Crystal was
kept within these walls…”\c"
M01120003,"\h(《Fina》)This is written in the holy language
of the Silver Temple.\e"
M01120004,"\h(《Fina》)The Silvites must have inscribed these
words when they were here.\c"
M01120005,"\h(《Vyse》)So, this Quetya person that all the Ixa'takans
keep talking about was probably a Silvite just
like Fina.\e"
M01120006,"\h(《Aika》)That would explain why everyone mistook Fina
for Quetya… whoever he or she is.\c"
M01120007,"\h(《Vyse》)There some kind of writing on the walls, but
I can't read it. I have no idea what it says…\c"
M01120008,"\h(《Vyse》)There are pictures of people wearing masks.
They're probably ancestors of the Ixa'takans.\c"
M01120009,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the pedestal where the Moon Crystal was.
There's an empty spot where it used to be.\c"
ME0150000,"\h(《Vyse》)There's an indentation just big enough
to fit a small gem…\e"
ME0150001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Let's try putting in the Golden Man's Eye gem.”
“Let's try putting in the Great Bird's Eye gem.”
“It might be dangerous… let's not touch it.”\e"
ME0150002,"\h(《Vyse》)The Golden Man's Eye is giving off a strange
light now…\e"
ME0150003,"\h(《Vyse》)The Great Bird's Eye is set into an indentation
in the statue…\e"
ME0150004,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Switch it with the Golden Man's Eye.”
“Just take the Great Bird's Eye out.”
“Leave it as it is.”\e"
ME0150005,"\h(《Vyse》)There's an indentation just big enough
to fit a small gem…\e"
ME0150006,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Let's try putting in the Golden Man's Eye gem.”
“Let's try putting in the Great Bird's Eye gem.”
“It might be dangerous… let's not touch it.”\e"
ME0150007,"\h(《Vyse》)The Golden Man's Eye is set into an indentation

ME0150008,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Just take the Golden Man's Eye out.”
“Switch it with the Great Bird's Eye.”
“Leave it as it is.”\e"
ME0150009,"\h(《Vyse》)The Great Bird's Eye is giving off a strange
light now…\e"
M01120010,"\h(《Vyse》)This statue…
It looks like the statues that were at the
entrance to Rixis…\c"
M01120011,"\h(《Vyse》)……!
Who's that!?\e"
M01120012,"\h(《Aika》)That's it!
That's the ghost that
I saw earlier!\c"
M01120013,"\h(《Fina》)Oh…
It's running away!\e"
M01120014,"\h(《Drachma》)Who'd be lurkin' around in a place like this?!
Don't let him get away, boy!\c"
M01120015,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay in Rixis a little while longer.”\c"
M01120016,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay in Rixis a little while longer.”\c"
M01120017,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take out the Golden Man's Eye gem.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
M01120018,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take out the Great Bird's Eye gem.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
