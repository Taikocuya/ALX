Temple of the Silver Moon…”\e"
M01120001,"\h(《Fina》)“… have sealed within the forests, after the
Rains of Destruction washed away the lands,
the unsleeping giant, Grendel…”\e"

M01120004,"\h(《Fina》)The Silvites must have inscribed these
words when they were here.\c"
M01120005,"\h(《Vyse》)So, this Quetya person that all the Ixa'takans
keep talking about was probably a Silvite just
like Fina.\e"
M01120006,"\h(《Aika》)That would explain why everyone mistook Fina
for Quetya… whoever he or she is.\c"
M01120007,"\h(《Vyse》)There some kind of writing on the walls, but
I can't read it. I have no idea what it says…\c"
M01120008,"\h(《Vyse》)There are pictures of people wearing masks.
They're probably ancestors of the Ixa'takans.\c"

ME0150001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Let's try putting in the Golden Man's Eye gem.”
“Let's try putting in the Great Bird's Eye gem.”
“It might be dangerous… let's not touch it.”\e"
ME0150002,"\h(《Vyse》)The Golden Man's Eye is giving off a strange
light now…\e"
ME0150003,"\h(《Vyse》)The Great Bird's Eye is set into an indentation
in the statue…\e"
ME0150004,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Switch it with the Golden Man's Eye.”
“Just take the Great Bird's Eye out.”
“Leave it as it is.”\e"

M01120012,"\h(《Aika》)That's it!
That's the ghost that
I saw earlier!\c"
M01120013,"\h(《Fina》)Oh…
It's running away!\e"
M01120014,"\h(《Drachma》)Who'd be lurkin' around in a place like this?!
