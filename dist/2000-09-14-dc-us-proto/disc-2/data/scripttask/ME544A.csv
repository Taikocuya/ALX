“I quit.”\c"
MA5440000,"\h(《Galcian's Elite Vessel》)Infidels! We will not let you past here!
You will get no closer to Lord Galcian!\e"
MA5440001,"\h(《Galcian's Elite Vessel》)All hands to battlestations!
Do whatever you have to do, just
make sure they don't get past us!\c"
MA5440002,"\h(《Aika》)Look!
The enemy's running away!\e"
MA5440003,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Pursue and attack!”
“Stay put. We shouldn't just rush in…”\e"
MA5440004,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright, let's go after them!
Full speed ahead!\c"
MA5440005,"\h(《Galcian's Elite Vessel》)Alright, they've taken the bait!
Slow to half speed, and prepare to attack!\e"

Prepare yourselves, Air Pirates!\c"

Maintain present course and speed,
and continue attacking.\e"
MA5440008,"\h(《Gilder》)You're right. There's no way that
an elite unit like that
would just turn tail and run.\e"
MA5440009,"\h(《Aika》)So that was just a trick
to try and lure us in?\e"
MA5440010,"\h(《Gilder》)Yep. But we've got the upper hand now.
Now's our chance to attack!\c"
