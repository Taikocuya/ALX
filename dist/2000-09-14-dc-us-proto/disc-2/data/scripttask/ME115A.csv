MF0400000,"\h(《Vyse》)This door is huge!
I don't know how the two of us can open it.\e"
MF0400001,"\h(《Gilder》)There's probably some sort of trick to opening 
it.\e"
MF0400002,"\h(《Gilder》)What?!
What was that!?\e"
MF0400003,\h(《Fina》)Aaaahhhh!\e
MF0400004,\h(《Aika》)What was that!?\e
MF0400005,"\h(《Fina》)Whatever it was, it just opened the door.\e"
MF0400006,\h(《Aika》)I don't know if that's good or bad.\e
MF0400007,\h(《Vyse》)I didn't touch anything… Did you?\e
MF0400008,"\h(《Gilder》)Hmm…
The map said something like…
“When the two pieces come together…”\e"
MF0400009,"\h(《Gilder》)I wonder if anyone else is here?
Heh… nevermind… what are the chances of that?\e"
MF0400010,\h(《Fina》)Aika… what do you think we should do?\e
MF0400011,"\h(《Aika》)I'm not sure how, but the door opened, and 
there's treasure inside. We should go!\e"
M01150000,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! Why won't this door open?! It won't even
budge!!\e"
M01150001,"\h(《Fina》)There's something written here… It's an old
language, but I think I can read it…\e"
M01150002,"\h(《Fina》)“When the two become one, the path will
reveal itself to you…”\e"
M01150003,"\h(《Aika》)What's that supposed to mean?! Why is Daccat
being so stingy?! It's not like any of his gold
means anything to him anymore!!!\c"
M01150004,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, great! More doors that won't open!
I really don't get what Daccat was thinking when
he built this place…\c"
M01150005,"\h(《Vyse》)Another door…
Damn… This one won't budge either.\c"
M01150006,\h(《Vyse》)A lever? I wonder what it's for…\c
M01150007,"\h(《Aika》)Doors that open by themselves… Levers that we
have no idea what they do… I really, really
don't get this place.\c"
M01150008,"\h(《Aika》)Another door?  Just great… But wait, what's
this stone tablet on the ground for?\c"
M01150009,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… There's probably some trick to opening
this door, too.\c"
M01150010,"\h(《Aika》)Another door with a stone tablet on the ground.
Well, it worked when we stepped on the tablet
last time…\c"
M01150011,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like I have to step on this tablet
to open the door. I think I just have to stand
here for a certain length of time or something…\c"
M01150012,"\h(《Aika》)Another door with a stone tablet on the ground.
Well, it worked when we stepped on the tablet
last time…\c"

M01150016,"\h(《Vyse》)It seems like the legendary Air Pirate
Daccat had a pretty good sense of humor.\c"
M01150017,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)“Return to your ship.”
“Stay here for a little while longer.”\c"
