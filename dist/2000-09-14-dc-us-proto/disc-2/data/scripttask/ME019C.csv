M08120000,"\h(《Cleaning Lady》)Princess Moegi has really been down in the dumps
lately. I wonder if it's because she's worried
about her brother?\e"
M08120001,"\h(《Cleaning Lady》)Goodness me, why am I rattling on about to a
visitor from abroad who I've only met for the
first time. Please pay no attention.\c"
M08120002,"\h(《Cleaning Lady》)Is that right? Foreign ships have filled the
harbor… Oh dear. Now Princess Moegi has one
more thing to worry about.\e"
M08120003,"\h(《Cleaning Lady》)But its really not something that we commoners
should concern ourselves with, is it? I think
the princess will get through this just fine.\c"
M08120004,"\h(《Cleaning Lady》)Now the princess can finally begin thinking
about her own happiness. I'm really glad.\e"
M08120005,"\h(《Cleaning Lady》)It's good to see you again. How has Princess
Moegi been since we last met?\e"
M08120006,"\h(《Cleaning Lady》)Even though she has been away from us, we
Yafutomans have never stopped thinking about our
beloved princess.\c"
M08130000,"\h(《Girl》)You know, sir, my big sister spends all her time
worrying about how our princess is doing.\c"
M08130001,"\h(《Girl》)Did you know, sir? A foreign fleet has sailed
into the harbor. Maybe I'll go have a look.\c"
M08130002,"\h(《Girl》)Say, is it true the foreign fleet has gone home
already? I was planning to go have a look at it.\c"
M08130003,"\h(《Girl》)You know, sir, when I grow up, I think I want to
go sailing on a ship, too.\e"
M08130004,"\h(《Girl》)When Princess Moegi went abroad, she went on a
ship, right? I want to do the same thing.\c"
M08140000,\h(《Koketa》)Food! Food!\e
M08150000,"\h(《Kirala》)Oh, you must be the Westerners they're all
talking about. I'm Kirala.
I'm the best builder in the country.\e"
M08150001,"\h(《Kirala》)So what do you think of our town?
I bet you don't see such fine structures in your
country.\e"
M08150002,"\h(《Well…》)“You're right about that.”
“Nah, it's nothing special.”\e"
M08150003,"\h(《Vyse》)You're right about that. What a difference
between seeing something and only hearing about
it. You've really got a fine-looking town here.\e"
M08150004,"\h(《Kirala》)Ha ha, do you really think so? Well, it sure
warms my heart to hear you say that.\e"
M08150005,"\h(《Kirala》)Say! Maybe I should go back west with you and
visit your country.\e"
M08150006,"\h(《Kirala》)I could probably show you Westerners a thing or
two that would really amaze you.\e"
M08150007,"\h(《Vyse》)H, hey… What're you going to do about this
place then? It's still under construction!\e"
M08150008,"\h(《Kirala》)Ha ha, not to worry. This is my own house.
It was getting pretty old, so I decided to
remodel.\e"
M08150009,"\h(《Kirala》)Well, then, it's decided.
I'll go back with you to your country and build
all sorts of things for you.\e"
M08150010,\h(　)Kirala has joined your crew as a “Builder.”\e
M08150011,"\h(《Kirala》)Incidentally, I have a little sister named
Urala.
You might want to give her a holler, too.\e"
M08150012,"\h(《Vyse》)Nah, it's nothing special. We've got plenty of
structures back home that look more impressive
than these.\e"
M08150013,"\h(《Kirala》)What?! You're telling me that the homes and
buildings you have back west are better than
mine?\e"
M08150014,"\h(《Kirala》)Hrumph! I can't let a remark like that go
unchallenged. I'm going to have to do something
about it.\e"
M08150015,"\h(《Kirala》)I say I should go back with you to your country
and build all sorts of things to show you just
what I can do.\e"
M08150016,"\h(《Vyse》)H, hey… What're you going to do about this
place then? It's still under construction!\e"
M08150017,"\h(《Kirala》)Ha ha, not to worry. This is my own house.
It was getting pretty old, so I decided to
remodel.\e"
M08150018,"\h(《Kirala》)Well, then, it's decided.
I'll go back with you to your country and build
all sorts of things for you.\e"
M08150019,\h(　)Kirala has joined your crew as a “Builder.”\e
M08150020,"\h(《Kirala》)Incidentally, I have a little sister named
Urala.
You might want to give her a holler, too.\e"
Ms019c000,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… Those birds are sorta cute. The babies are
following the parent around. I wonder what those
birds are called…\c"
Ms019c001,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a vegetable that looks sort of like the
turnips that we grow back home. It looks like
they've been cut into long, thin strips, though.\c"
Ms019c002,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, these fish look delicious.
They look like they've been properly dried, too.
I wonder who they're for…\c"
Ms019c003,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow… This lumber is perfectly smooth.
It looks like the work of a master craftsman…\c"
Ms019c004,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like Yafutoman is written from top to
bottom. I wonder how you're supposed to read
it then…\c"
Ms019c005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's Mur Loqua. The loqua here must be better
than anywhere else in the world, considering the
abundance of Blue Moon Stones around here.\c"
Ms019c006,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't know what to make of this… plant.
It looks almost like a big seed… or little tree
or something… Some sort of vegetable, maybe?\c"
Ms019c007,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… I wonder what this drink is made of.
It doesn't smell quite like loqua…
and it's green, too.\c"
Ms019c008,"\h(《Vyse》)What the…?! It looks like there's dirt inside
this pot! And they're boiling vegetables inside
of it, too!\c"
Ms019c009,"\h(《Vyse》)What's this? It almost looks like candy inside
this small bottle…\c"
Ms019c010,"\h(《Vyse》)It's some kind of cloudy soup… It's brown, too.
I don't know if I even want to try drinking
some of that…\c"
