M01000000,"\h(《Polly》)This place isn't bad. It sort of reminds me
of my tavern back on Sailors' Island.\e"
M01000001,\h(《Polly》)I think I'll be able to cook here… \e
M01000002,"\h(《Polly》)But, the kitchen could use a little work.
It needs some remodeling if I'm going to make
some of my more popular dishes.\c"
M01000003,"\h(《Polly》)If you let me remodel the place, I'll be able 
to open a tavern here on your island.\c"
M01000004,"\h(《Polly》)Well, now that I have a kitchen that I can use,
I'll just need some cooking supplies so I can
get started.\e"
M01000005,"\h(《Polly》)Hmm… I can get everything that I need for 
1,000 gold.\e"
M01000006,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Give 1,000 gold to Polly.”
“Not right now.”\e"
M01000007,"\h(　)You gave Polly 1,000 gold.\e"
M01000008,"\h(《Polly》)Thank you, Vyse! You won't be disappointed.
I'll start to get things ready right away!\c"
M01000009,"\h(《Polly》)Thanks for the offer, but you don't have enough
gold right now. I'd be more than happy to start
cooking if you can get the gold.\e"
M01000010,"\h(《Polly》)As soon as I can get 1,000 gold, I'll be able to
start cooking for everyone. I can't wait!\c"
M01000011,"\h(《Polly》)If you come back a little later, 
I'll have some food ready for you.\c"
M01000100,"\h(《Polly》)Now that my kitchen is fully stocked, 
I can start cooking the good stuff.\e"
M01000101,"\h(《Polly》)Actually, would you like me to make something
for you that will help you on your mission?\e"
M01000102,"\h(《Polly》)All the sailors used to call it a 
“Polly Special.” I just need 10 “Grules”.
They're a specific type of flying fish.\e"
M01000103,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Order a Polly Special.”
“Come back some other time.”\e"
M01000104,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, I've got 10 Grules right here.\e"
M01000105,"\h(《Polly》)Wow, you're always prepared, aren't you Vyse?
Just sit tight, one “Polly Special” comin' right
up!\e"
M01000106,"\h(《Polly》)… Thanks for waiting!
Here you go!\e"
M01000107,"\h(《Polly》)It will heal your wounds, as well as replenish 
your magic, but it takes a little while to take 
effect, so don't eat it during a battle.\e"
M01000108,\h(　)You received a “Polly Special.”\c
M01000109,"\h(《Polly》)Sorry, Vyse, but it looks like you don't have
enough Grules. It's alright, though. Just come
back when you do.\c"
M01000110,"\h(《Polly》)If you bring me 10 Grules, I'll make you a
“Polly Special.” You'll love it!\c"
M01000111,"\h(《Polly》)Hm? You already have more than enough to eat!
Come back once you've finished what I've cooked
for you already.\c"
M01000023,"\h(《Polly》)Hello, Vyse. What can I do for you?\e"
M01000024,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Have Polly cook some food.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M01000025,"\h(《Polly》)You want to eat some good old-fashioned sailor
food? Leave it to me!\c"
M01000026,"\h(《Polly》)Yafutoman food tastes pretty good, too!\e"
M01000027,"\h(《Polly》)I was watching Urala cook earlier. She makes the
broth for her soup from fish.
It tastes great!\c"
M01000028,"\h(《Polly》)I'll be able to open my kitchen in a little 
while. Don't worry about a thing!\c"
M01000029,"\h(《Polly》)Hello, Vyse. Do you want something?\e"
M01000030,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Have Polly cook some food.”
“Come back later.”\e"
M01000031,"\h(《Polly》)You want to eat some good old-fashioned sailor
food? Leave it to me!\c"
M01000032,"\h(《Polly》)I never thought that I'd ever see Robinson
again.\e"
M01000033,"\h(《Polly》)Thank you for everything you've done for me,
Vyse. I'm so glad that I came with you…\c"
M01000034,"\h(《Polly》)I'll be able to open my kitchen in a little 
while. Don't worry about a thing!\c"
M01000043,"\h(《Polly》)It's nice to take a break from cooking and eat
some of Urala's food. It's great!\c"
M01140032,"\h(《Pinta》)Alright, if I can catch any of them, I'll bring
them back to Crescent Isle, okay?\c"
M01140033,"\h(《Pinta》)I've found a lot of islands where some really
interesting animals live!\e"
M01140034,"\h(《Pinta》)Where is the island, you ask? Heh… It's a
secret. Well, if you're only interested in
the animals, I can bring some back here.\e"
M01140035,"\h(《Pinta》)It will take 500 gold to pay for their food and
stuff. Do you still want me to catch some for
you?\e"
M01140036,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Go ahead and catch some for me, Pinta.”
“On second thought, never mind.”\e"
M01140037,"\h(《Vyse》)Some animals, huh? Hmm… It might be nice to
have some pets around here. Well, why not.
Go ahead and catch some for the island, okay?\e"
M01140038,"\h(《Pinta》)Aye aye!
But first, what kind of animals would you like?\e"
M01140039,"\h(《What kind do you want?》)“Something cute from the east.”
“Something colorful from the south.”
“Something scary-looking from the west.”\e"
M01140040,"\h(《Pinta》)You don't have enough money!
Well, just come back when you do and I'll take
care of everything for you, okay?\c"
M01140041,"\h(《Pinta》)Well, alright. I think having some pets around
here would be nice, though. Just let me know if
you change your mind, okay?\c"
M01140042,"\h(《Pinta》)Hey! Do you like the little animals that I
caught for you?\e"
M01140043,"\h(《What will you say to Pinta?》)“They're perfect!”
“Hmm… I'd like to see a different one.”\e"
M01140044,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, they're perfect!
I like them a lot. Thanks for catching them,
Pinta.\e"
M01140045,"\h(《Pinta》)That's great! I'm glad you like them.
Well, just in case you ever want to have some
different animals here, just let me know!\c"
M01140046,"\h(《Vyse》)I like the animals that you brought, Pinta, but
I was wondering what the other animals looked
like…\e"
M01140047,"\h(《Pinta》)Well, if you want me to get another kind of
animal, it will cost 500 gold.\e"
M01140048,"\h(《Pinta》)And, if we mix the different types of animals on
this island, they might fight, so I'll have to
return these animals to their island, okay?\e"
M01140049,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Hm… Forget about it then.”
“Sure, bring something different this time.”\e"
M01140050,"\h(《Pinta》)Well, just in case you ever want to have some
different animals here, just let me know!\c"
M01140051,"\h(《Pinta》)You don't have enough money!
Well, just come back when you do and I'll take
care of everything for you, okay?\c"
M01140052,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright. I'm counting on you, Pinta.\e"
M01140053,"\h(《Pinta》)Aye aye!
But first, what kind of animals would you like?\e"
M01140054,"\h(《What kind do you want?》)“Something colorful from the south.”
“Something scary-looking from the west.”\e"
M01140055,"\h(《What kind do you want?》)“Something cute from the east.”
“Something scary-looking from the west.”\e"
M01140056,"\h(《What kind do you want?》)“Something cute from the east.”
“Something colorful from the south.”\e"
M01140057,"\h(《Pinta》)Well, just in case you ever want to have some
different animals here, just let me know!\c"
M01140058,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess I'll go with the cute ones. Otherwise,
Aika will probably start complaining.\e"
M01140059,"\h(《Pinta》)Aye aye!
I'll go catch some right away!\e"
M01140060,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I think we need a little color around
here. Go catch some colorful little creatures
for me, okay?\e"
M01140061,"\h(《Pinta》)Aye aye!
I'll go catch some right away!\e"
M01140062,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… Well, since we're Air Pirates, we should
probably get some scary looking pets.\e"
M01140063,"\h(《Pinta》)Aye aye!
I'll go catch some right away!\e"
M02000000,"\h(《Marco》)I never thought that I would ever be able to get
out of Valua. And I never knew the outside
world was so big!\e"
M02000001,"\h(《Marco》)After your little pep talk, I've been wanting to
see as much of the world as I can. Thanks, Vyse!
I can't wait to go sailing again!\c"
M02000002,"\h(《Marco》)Heh… The biggest surprise for me after getting 
out of Valua was probably the sky… It's blue. 
I've never seen a blue sky before…\e"
M02000003,"\h(《Marco》)And the clouds are white! I thought they were 
all dark like the ones in Valua!\e"
M02000004,"\h(《Marco》)Hey, don't laugh! If you lived in Lower City 
your whole life, you'd understand!\c"
M02000005,"\h(《Marco》)So, how's the ship's new engine doing?\e"
M02000006,"\h(《Marco》)Heh… Who'd have thought that I'd become an 
engineer… I actually help build that thing! I 
did a pretty good job if I do say so myself.\c"
M02000007,"\h(《Marco》)Welcome back, Vyse! I bet you were surprised to 
find the island all fixed up, weren't you?\e"
M02000008,"\h(《Marco》)I helped Izmael a lot, too! Okay, well… I only 
painted the walls, but it was still a lot of
work!\c"
M02000009,"\h(《Marco》)Hey, you guys saw the shooting stars that were
falling over Valua, right?\e"
M02000010,"\h(《Marco》)Ever since that happened, you and Aika have been
looking pretty upset. What's up? Did something
bad happen?\c"
M02000011,"\h(《Marco》)The Armada made the Moon Stones fall on Valua,
huh?\e"
M02000012,"\h(《Marco》)I… I didn't really like the place, but… I grew
up there. It makes me sad that it's all gone.\e"
M02000013,"\h(《Marco》)Vyse, promise me that we'll beat the Armada. 
We can't let them get away with what they've
done.\c"
M02000014,"\h(《Marco》)We have to stop them before they destroy all of
the other lands. There's so much I haven't seen
yet.\c"
M04090000,"\h(《Kalifa》)Welcome. Listen to my words and the path of
light will be shown to you…\e"
M04090001,"\h(《Will you have your fortune told?》)“Pay 10 gold for your fortune.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M04090002,"\h(《Kalifa》)Remember my words and heed them carefully.
Now go forth and fulfill your destiny.\c"
M04090003,"\h(《Kalifa》)One more thing… the Red Moon requires a better
tent to properly bestow its wisdom unto me. I
cannot work well in these… conditions.\c"
M04090004,"\h(《Kalifa》)Welcome. Heed my words and the future will be
known…\e"
M04090005,"\h(《Will you have your fortune told?》)“Pay 10 gold for your fortune.”
“Pay 100 gold for your fortune.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M04090006,"\h(《Kalifa》)Welcome. Listen to my words and the path of
light will be shown to you…\e"
M04090007,"\h(《Will you have your fortune told?》)“Pay 10 gold for your fortune.”
“Pay 100 gold for your fortune.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M04090008,\h(　)You gave 10 gold to Kalifa.\e
M04090009,"\h(《Kalifa》)Very well.
Let us begin.\c"
M04090010,\h(《Kalifa》)Hmmm…\e
M04090011,\h(《Kalifa》)Haaaa!!!\e
M04090012,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Remember to chew your
food well before swallowing!\e"
M04090013,"\h(《Kalifa》)That way you won't choke on it, 
and it also aids the digestion process.\c "
M04090014,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Having a low
“Swashbuckler Rating” will affect your mission!\e"
M04090015,"\h(《Kalifa》)When you have a low rating, it will become
easier to run from fights and easier to avoid
them all together!\c"
M04090016,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Hmm… it looks like
tomorrow will be partly cloudy and there is
chance of rain in some areas.\e"
M04090017,"\h(《Kalifa》)So, if you have any laundry out to dry, you
better bring it inside today!\c"
M04090018,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Having a high
“Swashbuckler Rating” will affect the morale
of your crew in a positive manner.\e"
M04090019,"\h(《Kalifa》)Your courage will inspire them, and they will 
fight harder! You will be more successful 
in battle!\c"
M04090020,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! On… Pirate Isle…
the little girl named Lindsi… Oh, no!
She will be playing on the dock and… and…\e"
M04090021,"\h(《Kalifa》)… and she's going to get a splinter in her
finger!\c"
M04090022,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! A woman from a tavern
and a man who sits alone in silence will be
reunited!\e"
M04090023,"\h(《Kalifa》)And they will live happily ever after once 
they are together again as husband and wife. 
Such a happy ending…\c"
M04090024,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Your lucky number is
81. Your lucky color is white.\e"
M04090025,"\h(《Kalifa》)Couples should spend more time outdoors!
It's more romantic outside…\c"
M04090026,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! On Sailors' Island,
there are some rare items for sale.\e"
M04090027,"\h(《Kalifa》)So, be sure to check back there as often as
possible to see what new wares are in the
merchants' possession!\c"
M04090028,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! You will meet many
people during your travels. You will also part
with many people…\e"
M04090029,"\h(《Kalifa》)What? You say that could be anyone's fortune?!
Skeptic! You must learn to accept your own fate.
Then you will learn your true purpose.\c"
M04090030,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! In this world, there
are 3 special Chams called Abirik Chams.\e"
M04090031,"\h(《Kalifa》)You never know where you'll get them from, so
make sure to be nice to people… they may
surprise you with a gift.\c"
M04090032,"\h(《Kalifa》)Defensive techniques only last for one round,
but their effect is guaranteed.\e"
M04090033,"\h(《Kalifa》)So, if you can anticipate your enemies moves,
you will be able to render their attacks
ineffective.\c"
M04090034,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Once you are the
captain of your own ship and your Spirits
are as high as they can be…\e"
M04090035,"\h(《Kalifa》)You will gain the power to call forth all of
your allies to battle by your side.\c"
M04090036,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Your crew will react
differently depending on the condition of your
ship.\e"
M04090037,"\h(《Kalifa》)Once you have a crew, talk to them often.
Especially when all seems lost.\c"
M04090038,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! If you want to
make your cannons more effective, seek out
a “Gunner” for your crew.\e"
M04090039,"\h(《Kalifa》)On the other hand, if you wish to increase the
defensive power of your ship, then you should
find an “Engineer” to help maintain it.\c"
M04090040,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Princess Moegi will 
find love. But that love will cause her great
pain.\e"
M04090041,"\h(《Kalifa》)I… I cannot see more. The future hangs in the
balance. You must be strong, for you carry the
the fate of the world on your shoulders.\c"
M04090042,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! If you always stand
your ground in a fight, word will spread
amongst the people of your bravery.\e"
M04090043,"\h(《Kalifa》)On the other hand, if you always flee from your
adversaries, the people will learn of your
cowardice. Be careful in your actions.\c"
M04090044,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! When a Moon Stone 
becomes contaminated, it becomes a “Chom.”
The have the opposite effect as “Chams.”\e"
M04090045,"\h(《Kalifa》)Giving Cupil a Chom will result in him
regurgitating all of the Chams that he has eaten
up until that point. Use them wisely.\c"
M04090046,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Tonight, you must
avoid eating fish at all costs!\e"
M04090047,"\h(《Kalifa》)If you do, it will upset your stomach and you
will feel a sickness many times worse than that
caused by air travel.\c"
M04090048,\h(《Kalifa》)… Nothing. I see nothing.\e
M04090049,"\h(《Kalifa》)Well, just consider the gold that you spent as
an investment in your future.\c"
M04090050,\h(《Kalifa》)… Nothing. I see nothing.\e
M04090051,"\h(《Kalifa》)Well, just consider the gold that you spent as
an investment in your future.\c"
M04090052,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!\e"
M04090053,"\h(《Kalifa》)Ancient wisdom will fall because of what a young
heart feels.\c"
M04090054,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!
I see great danger in your immediate future!\e"
M04090055,"\h(《Kalifa》)A great evil takes many shapes, 
but in reality… It has none.
That is all I can say, for now.\c"
M04090056,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!
But it is cloudy… Perhaps another 10 gold 
tomorrow will clear things up!\e"
M04090057,"\h(《Kalifa》)Hey, fortune tellers have to eat too, you know.
\c"
M04090058,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!
I see a Moon Stone! But, it's color is…\e"
M04090059,"\h(《Kalifa》)Hard to see. It's not red. Nor is it purple, 
blue, or green. Nor is it yellow, or silver. 
It's a color that I've never seen.\c"
M04090060,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!\e"
M04090061,"\h(《Kalifa》)There is more to Deep Sky, than meets the eye!
Use caution, Vyse, for there is great evil under
the clouds.\c"
M04090072,"\h(《Kalifa》)The Red Moon has spoken.
Remember my words and heed them carefully.
Now go forth and fulfill your destiny.\c"
M04090073,\h(　)You gave 100 gold to Kalifa.\e
M04090074,"\h(《Kalifa》)Very well.
Let us begin.\c"
M04090075,\h(《Kalifa》)Hmmm…\e
M04090076,\h(《Kalifa》)Haaaa!!!\e
M04090077,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere above the
skies of Valua, there lives a man who studies
for the betterment of the world.\e"
M04090078,"\h(《Kalifa》)If you show this man the wisdom in your souls,
perhaps he will join you on your quest and aid
your cause.\c"
M04090079,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere in the
lands to the east, there exists an island
populated by curious little creatures.\e"
M04090080,"\h(《Kalifa》)Search for this island to the north of the great
mountain. Perhaps you will find something useful
there.\c"
M04090081,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere in the dark
storm, there are strange stones that give off a
black light.\e"
M04090082,"\h(《Kalifa》)Perhaps these stones are a window to the past
and speak of untold tragedies of the days of
old.\c"
M04090083,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere beneath the
clouds of the dark storm, there exists a type of
fish that has remained unchanged over the ages.\e"
M04090084,"\h(《Kalifa》)Perhaps these fish will be of some use to you.
Go forth and seek them out.\c"
M04090085,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! To the north of
Yafutoma, there lives a man, who's soul burns
with the fires of his forge.\e"
M04090086,"\h(《Kalifa》)He is a proud old man. Do not expect his help
unless you believe yourself truly worthy of his
craftsmanship.\c"
M04090087,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere in the
skies above the desert, there exists a cold,
unburning star of metal.\e"
M04090088,"\h(《Kalifa》)The people of the ancient world built this
star with their own hands. What purpose it
served is not known even to me.\c"
M04090089,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! South of the forest
islands, there is a being that forever looks to
the skies.\e"
M04090090,"\h(《Kalifa》)Search near the island that is divided by stone
reefs. Perhaps you will find what you seek.\c"
M04090091,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! South of the forest
islands, there is a being that forever looks to
the skies.\e"
M04090092,"\h(《Kalifa》)Search near the island that is divided by stone
reefs. Perhaps you will find what you seek.\c"
M04090093,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! The man who seeks
nothing more than food can help you in your
search for exotic ingredients.\e"
M04090094,"\h(《Kalifa》)It would appear that he used to be an Air Pirate
himself. Go forth and seek him out.\c"
M04090095,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! In the place of your
birth… in your father's study… there is a
secret pathway behind his bookshelf.\e"
M04090096,"\h(《Kalifa》)If you have not found it yet, that probably
means that you're not a very good treasure
hunter, I suppose.\c"
M04090097,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Aika… your secret
stash of gold is hidden…\e"
M04090098,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! You don't have to tell everyone! What's the
point of having a secret stash if you're just
going to tell everyone where it is?!\c"
M04090099,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! There is a place upon
which the Moons cast their shadows.\e"
M04090100,"\h(《Kalifa》)It is located high above the clouds. You will
know that you have reached the area when
everything around you grows dark.\c"
M04090101,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Once you connect with
the “other world,” a strange island will appear
above the dark storm.\e"
M04090102,"\h(《Kalifa》)The island is beautiful in a mysterious way…
Perhaps you should seek this island out.\c"
M04090103,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Far above the skies
of Ixa'taka, stands a building of ancient
design!\e"
M04090104,"\h(《Kalifa》)The people of the Old World worked wonders with
their technology and power. Perhaps we can all
learn from their success… and their failure.\c"
M04090105,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! In the city of the
forests, there is a woman who vows vengeance on
those who have wronged her.\e"
M04090106,"\h(《Kalifa》)She awaits the person that will answer her
prayers. But she will need proof that you are
that answer.\c"
M04090107,"\h(《Kalifa》)… I see nothing.
Come back another time.
I must rest.\e"
M04090108,"\h(《Kalifa》)Can you blame me? It is impossible to work all
the time. I suppose that even you, the great
Vyse, must stop and rest on occasion, right?\c"
M04090109,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere above the
clouds, a ship without a crew aimlessly wanders
through the skies.\e"
M04090110,"\h(《Kalifa》)I see beneath the ship, I see nothing but
darkness… Perhaps you should try searching
somewhere above the Dark Rift.\c"
M04090111,"\h(《Kalifa》)Somewhere, you found a single coin bearing the
mark of a legend.\e"
M04090112,"\h(《Kalifa》)The Guildmaster in Nasrad has been searching for
such a coin for a very long time. Perhaps he
will be willing to pay handsomely for it.\c"
M04090113,"\h(《Kalifa》)My skills do not end with fortune-telling. 
Take me onboard your ship once in a while.\e"
M04090114,"\h(《Kalifa》)If you win a ship battle with me onboard, I will
find rare items for you… if I feel you are
worthy.\c"
M04090115,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! In the ruins of
Nasrad, there is a once-proud woman, sitting
amidst the ashes of her store.\e"
M04090116,"\h(《Kalifa》)Perhaps she would be of some use in your crew.
She is quite skilled in acquiring rare and
unusual items after ship battles.\c"

Come back another time.
I must rest.\e"

M04090138,\h(　)You gave 100 gold to Kalifa.\e
M04090139,"\h(《Kalifa》)Very well.
Let us begin.\c"
M04090140,\h(《Kalifa》)Hmmm…\e
M04090141,\h(《Kalifa》)Haaaa!!!\e
M04090142,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! There are monsters in
this world that cannot be defeated by a blade.
These giant beasts must be fought by ship.\e"
M04090143,"\h(《Kalifa》)One of them lives in the Lands of Ice.
It appears to be some sort of giant insect…\c"
M04090144,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! The young man named
Pinta will travel the known lands in search of
items for you!\e"
M04090145,"\h(《Kalifa》)So, the more land you map and the further you
travel, the more valuable items Pinta will be
able to find!\c"
M04090146,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! You will encounter
the treasure thief, Zivilyn Bane, eight times
throughout your adventures.\e"
M04090147,"\h(《Kalifa》)He only goes after treasures of legend. Whenever
you encounter him, rest assured, you will find
valuable treasure nearby.\c"
M04090148,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! If you are trying to
save up some money, you should fight plenty of
Kanezls.\e"
M04090149,"\h(《Kalifa》)The “Gold Pollen” of these creatures fetches a
high price on the market. If you happen to
acquire some, be sure to sell it immediately.\c"

M04090151,"\h(《Kalifa》)I'm sorry, but perhaps you should come back
another day. I shall keep your 100 gold to
help clear my mind…\c"
M04090152,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! The necessary
materials to build a great sword rest far
beneath the clouds.\e"
M04090153,"\h(《Kalifa》)If you pass those materials onto the right
person, he will forge for you a blade unlike
any other in this world.\c"
M04090154,"\h(《Kalifa》)There is a ring called the “Phantom Ring” that
allows the wearer to hide himself from the eyes
of any potential attackers.\e"
M04090155,"\h(《Kalifa》)So, by wearing this ring, you would be able to
make it safely through even the most monster-
infested lands unharmed.\c"
M04090156,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! I have seen where the
3 Abirik Chams of this world are located.\e"
M04090157,"\h(《Kalifa》)One is somewhere in the skies of Ixa'taka,
another is somewhere in Esparanza, and the last
is in Nasrad. Find out who has them!\c"
M04090158,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! The Red spell
“Increm” also works to help boost the offensive
power of you ship's cannons!\e"
M04090159,"\h(《Kalifa》)Be sure to use it to your advantage as often as
possible.\c"
M04090160,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Your ship has an
attribute called “Value.”\e"
M04090161,"\h(《Kalifa》)Depending on what parts you have equipped on
your ship, it will rise and fall, but it does
not have any effect on your ship's power.\c"
M04090162,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! When you connect with
the “other world,” a humongous monster will
appear!\e"
M04090163,"\h(《Kalifa》)It will be a much larger version of a beast that
you have already encountered numerous times.
Will you be able to defeat it?\c"
M04090164,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! On occasion, Cupil
will grow very hungry and behave strangely.\e"
M04090165,"\h(《Kalifa》)If you were to give him an Abirik Cham at that
point, he will change in ways that you would not
normally be able to see.\c"
M04090166,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! When you connect with
the “other world,” you will find a new weapon to
aid you in your fight against evil!\e"
M04090167,"\h(《Kalifa》)Hmm… Wait. I sense something more…
For some reason… the weapon… smells. Hmm…\c"
M04090168,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! There are 30 Chams in
this world.\e"
M04090169,"\h(《Kalifa》)Go forth and find all of them. Perhaps you will
be able to raise Cupil well enough to help him
reach his true form.\c"
M04090170,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! I'm sure that you
know some monsters carry items on them.\e"
M04090171,"\h(《Kalifa》)However, sometimes those very same monsters
carry extremely rare items that cannot be found
in any store anywhere.\c"
M04090172,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!
On occasion, you will encounter a mysterious
travelling merchant.\e"
M04090173,"\h(《Kalifa》)That merchant travels the world and acquires
rare and unusual items unavailable anywhere
else!\c"
M04090174,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Speed plays an
important factor in ship battles.\e"
M04090175,"\h(《Kalifa》)If you have a fast ship, you will have a better
chance of attacking first, and your cannons
will also have a better chance of hitting.\c"
M04090176,"\h(《Kalifa》)… Hmm. Nothing. My Moon Stone is not responding
to me at all.\e"
M04090177,"\h(《Kalifa》)I'm very sorry, but you will have to come back
another time. I cannot see anything if my Moon
Stone is not responding properly.\c"
M04090178,"\h(《Kalifa》)In this world, there is an item called the
“Berserker Ring.”\e"
M04090179,"\h(《Kalifa》)It will increase the wearer's aggressiveness,
causing him to get into more fights than usual.
It has its uses…\c"
M04090180,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! On occasion, Cupil
will grow very hungry and behave strangely.\e"

do not hesistate to come back.\c"

Remember my words and heed them carefully.
Now go forth and fulfill your destiny.\c"

stage for me to dance on, but he does not

take 500 gold to build.\e"

“Nothing.”\e"

Thank you! I will tell Izmael right now!\c"

your victory to come!
You will win!!\c"

traditional clothes for Yafutoman women when
they have celebrations.\e"
M05030008,"\h(《Merida》)I would like to wear this while dancing, but it
does not move well enough. Kirala said it would
take 500 gold to fix it. Do you have the money?\e"

I will give the money to Kirala right away!\c"

It is a traditional Yafutoman dance!
I love it!\c"
M05100000,"\h(《Hans》)I'm learning all about shipbuilding from Brabham
right now.\e"
M05100001,"\h(《Hans》)Brabham is an expert on all kinds of engines, 
from old models to new models, so I learn a lot 
from him!\e"
M05100002,\h(《Hans》)He let me see the Yaftoman Book on Polarity.\e
M05100003,"\h(《Hans》)I learned how to build an engine using wave 
motion technology, and how to rig the sail 
so your ship can hover.  I learned so much!\c"
M05100004,"\h(《Hans》)Building that new engine was quite a bit of
work. That old man Brabham is a machine! I
can't believe how hard he works!\e"
M05100005,"\h(《Hans》)He must be tired from all those all-nighters, 
but he doesn't show it.  He is so energetic, 
especially at his age!\c"
M05100006,"\h(《Hans》)Well, we've managed to rebuild the base, but we
still need to get ready for the assault on
the Armada.\e"
M05100007,"\h(《Hans》)Did you notice how fast some of those ships 
were, and the ones that can dive below the
clouds?\e"

people…\c"

side of us!\e"

from up here.\e"
M05210001,"\h(《Tikatika》)Nothing special happened today. Well, except
that Ismael took some of Brabham's food when
he wasn't looking.\c"
M05210002,"\h(《Tikatika》)Nothing to report today. Well, except that Marco
has a stomach ache. I think he drank water from
the pond…\c"
M05210003,"\h(《Tikatika》)Stay away from the pond. Prince Enrique and 
Princess Moegi are saying their final farewells 
before he leaves. Do not invade their privacy.\c"
M05210004,"\h(《Tikatika》)Nothing to report today. But, I did notice that 
Princess Moegi seems to be going to the pond 
every day to pray…\c"
M05210005,"\h(《Tikatika》)Welcome back, Captain. I was trying to see where
you were going in that little boat, but…\e"
M05210006,"\h(《Tikatika》)I can't quite see the silver shrine, even with 
my eyes.  It must be standing at a very high 
place.  I am a little surprised.\e"
M05210007,"\h(《Tikatika》)I can't quite see that island that rose up 
from under the clouds from here… 
even with my eagle-like eyes.  \e"
M05210008,"\h(《Tikatika》)But, I can sense the fear of the birds that come
from the direction of Ocean.  It's a very bad
feeling.\e"
M05210009,"\h(《Tikatika》)Nothing to report today. Heh… I can see
everyone from here!\e"
M05210010,"\h(《Tikatika》)Everyone is so energetic! I can feel their 
spirit. I'm sure we will win the battle 
against the Armada!\c"
M07060000,"\h(《Don》)When I heard this place used to be a desert
island, I figured it would be even more
depressing than Esparanza.\e"
M07060001,"\h(《Don》)But, you've got a good variety of food and 
drinks here, and you've assembled quite a crew. 
You're doing a great job!\c"
M07060002,"\h(《Don》)Polly is the best cook ever!
The stuff she makes is amazing!\e"
M07060003,"\h(《Don》)If it wasn't for you, I'd still be wallowing in 
self pity back on Esparanza.\c"
M07060004,"\h(《Don》)I've never had Yafutoman food before. It's 
great! If I made it through the Dark Rift, 
I would have discovered it a long time ago.\e"
M07060005,"\h(《Don》)I'm glad that I came with you, Vyse. 
Sailing with your crew is the most fun I've ever
had.\c"
M07060006,"\h(《Don》)Into Deep Sky, huh? I couldn't even make it 
through the Dark Rift. Now I'm about to sail 
into the underworld with you.\e"
M07060007,"\h(《Don》)Vyse, I gotta tell ya. There's never a dull 
moment when you're around. To say that you are 
inspirational would be an understatement.\e"
M07060008,"\h(《Don》)We all would have made it through the Dark Rift
if you were around back then.\c"
M07060009,"\h(《Don》)Hey, I really want to hear about the Great
Silver Shrine!\e"
M07060010,"\h(《Don》)While you were off adventuring, I was bustin' 
my butt working on these buildings.\c"
M07060011,"\h(《Don》)Hey, something happened to the Yellow Moon. 
It rained Moon Stones on Valua. Then there were
some explosions.\e"
M07060012,"\h(《Don》)I want to put my past behind me, but I'm worried
about the Valuans. They're not all bad, you
know.\c"
M07060013,"\h(《Don》)So, this is it, huh?  
If we all make it back, we're going to
celebrate!\e"
M07060014,\h(《Don》)I got my bottle of loqua ready!\e
M07060015,"\h(《Don》)Let's get 'em, Vyse!\c"
M08030000,\h(《Urala》)Oh… Vyse. Um… this is a really nice tavern.\e
M08030001,"\h(《Urala》)I wish I could serve Yafutoman food to everyone
on the island…\e"
M08030002,"\h(《Urala》)But, I guess that's impossible without
renovating the kitchen…\e"
M08030003,"\h(《Urala》)Oh, don't worry about it. 
I just miss my kitchen back home.\c"
M08030004,"\h(《Urala》)A lot of the ingredients that I normally use in
Yafutoma are really hard to get over here.\e"
M08030005,"\h(《Urala》)I wanted everyone to get a taste of Yafutoman
food!\e"
M08030006,"\h(《Urala》)But the ingredients are so expensive here…
It will take at least 1,000 gold…\c"
M08030007,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Give Urala 1000 gold.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M08030008,"\h(　)You gave 1,000 gold to Urala.\e"
M08030009,\h(《Urala》)Um… Are you sure about this?\e
M08030010,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure, don't worry about it. 
But you'd better make us some really good food!\e"
M08030011,"\h(《Urala》)Thank you very much!
I'll get started right away!\c"
M08030012,"\h(《Urala》)Um… it was nice of you to offer, 
but you don't have enough gold.\c"
M08030013,"\h(《Urala》)I guess I won't be able to make Yafutoman food
for anyone.\c"
M08030014,"\h(《Urala》)Um, Vyse… Thank you very much!
I'll get started right away!\c"
M08030015,"\h(《Urala》)Welcome, what can I do for you?\e"
M08030016,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Have Urala cook some food.”

M08030018,"\h(《Urala》)Thank you so much! 
I'll get started right away!\c"
M08030019,"\h(《Urala》)Umm… Polly's a really good cook!
We don't have this kind of food in Yafutoma.\e"
M08030020,"\h(《Urala》)It's a little more filling than what I'm used
to, but I think it's great!.\c"
M08030021,"\h(《Urala》)Umm… I'd be more than happy to make some 
Yafutoman food for you. Stop by later, 
when you get the chance.\c"
M08030100,"\h(《Urala》)Oh… Welcome!
I have been doing my best to cook for the crew!
I hope they like it!\e"
M08030101,"\h(《Urala》)Um… if you like, I could make you lunches that
you could take with you on your travels…\e"
M08030102,"\h(《Urala》)All I need is 10 “Romuhai Fish.” They're a type
of fish that's common back home in Yafutoma…\e"
M08030103,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Have Urala make lunch.”
“Come back some other time.”\e"
M08030104,"\h(《Vyse》)Actually, if it's Romuhai Fish you need, I have
10 right here.\e"
M08030105,"\h(《Urala》)Really? That's great! I can get started right
away!\e"
M08030106,"\h(《Urala》)… Thank you for waiting. I really hope you like
it.\e"
M08030107,"\h(《Urala》)It will heal all of your wounds and replenish
your magic… but takes a little while to start
working, so you can't eat it during a battle.\e"
M08030108,\h(　)You received “Urala's Lunch.”\c
M08030109,"\h(《Urala》)Um… I, I'm sorry.
You don't have the 10 Romuhai Fish that I need.
I can't make the dish without them…\c"
M08030110,"\h(《Urala》)If you bring me 10 Romuhai Fish, 
I'll be able to make you something special!\c"
M08030111,"\h(《Urala》)Um… Sorry, but it looks like you still have the
lunch I made for you earlier. It will heal you
all the way, so you don't need more than one.\c"
M08030043,"\h(《Urala》)Um… I heard that Polly own's her own tavern
back in her home town.\e"
M08030044,"\h(《Urala》)Wow… Polly really is something else. I'm glad
she's letting me help out here in her new
tavern!\c"
M08070000,"\h(《Moegi》)This is a very beautiful island that you've 
found, Vyse. This pond reminds me of home. 
It's relaxing.\e"
M08070001,"\h(《Moegi》)I wish that I can just stay here like this 
forever…\c"
M08070002,"\h(《Moegi》)Something seems to be bothering Prince Enrique…
\e"
M08070003,"\h(《Moegi》)I wish he would tell me what it was. Perhaps 
there is something that I could do to calm him
down…\c"
M08070004,"\h(《Moegi》)Prince Enrique, I know your decision is final. 
I… I understand your loyalty and love for your
country.\e"
M08070005,"\h(《Moegi》)I cannot stop you. But… please, return safely
to me. I could not bear the pain if something
were to happen to you…\c"
M08070006,"\h(《Moegi》)Ever since the island was attacked, I have been
worried about Prince Enrique. 
I hope that he is safe…\e"
M08070007,"\h(《Moegi》)I know that he is strong, but he's all alone. 
I am trying to hope for the best, 
but I fear the worst.\e"
M08070008,"\h(《Moegi》)Please, Prince Enrique, please… 
come back to me.\c"
M08070009,"\h(《Moegi》)I have a really bad feeling about that island 
that rose from Deep Sky.\e"
M08070010,\h(《Moegi》)I get the chills just thinking about it.\c
M08070011,"\h(《Moegi》)I thought I heard Prince Enrique scream when the
Moon Stones fell on Valua.
I hope he is safe.\e"
M08070012,"\h(《Moegi》)Captain Vyse, you believe that Prince Enrique is
safe, right?\c"
M08070013,"\h(《Moegi》)I am so happy that Prince Enrique came back 
safely. I don't know what I would have done if 
something happened to him.\c"
M08070014,"\h(《Moegi》)Captain Vyse, can you please take me with you 
when you fight against the Armada?\e"
M08070015,"\h(《Moegi》)I don't think I can stand being apart from 
Prince Enrique again… \c"
M08070016,\h(《Moegi》)Perhaps I might be able to help in some way…\e
M08150000,"\h(《Kirala》)Captain, need anything remodeled?
I'd be more than happy to add a little Yafutoman
flavor to our base.\e"

“Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150008,"\h(《Kirala》)Ok, leave it to me!  I'll have it remodeled 
Yafutoman style by the time you come back to
this island again.\c"

by the time you get back. Maybe she'll actually 
start giving us some useful information.\c"

What do you want?\e"

M08150031,"\h(《Kirala》)So, do you want a fountain built in praise of
the Moons instead? It'll cost you 5,000 gold.
Is that okay?\e"
M08150032,"\h(《Do you want to do this?》)“Sure, remodel the fountain”

of natural beauty, just like the fountains we
have back home in Yafutoma!\c"
M08150038,"\h(《Kirala》)Hey, as great as I am, I can't do much without
enough gold. Come back later when you have

Let me know when you decide on what you want.\c"
M08150040,"\h(《Kirala》)Well, to tell you the truth, 
I really like it like that. 
I don't feel like remodeling it.\c"

time you return to the island.\c"
M08150042,"\h(《Kirala》)Oh wait… weren't you already going to have
Izmael remodel that for you?\e"
M08150043,"\h(《Kirala》)If you want, I can remodel it instead.

Izmael to take care of that.\e"
M08150046,"\h(《Kirala》)Hahaha… it's quite alright.
Well, if you ever want me to remodel it later,
just let me know. I'd be happy to do it.\c"
M08150047,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah… but actually, I was having second
thoughts about the whole thing. I decided that I
want you to remodel it.\e"
M08150048,"\h(《Kirala》)Hahaha… I guess you can't deny true 
craftsmanship, huh? I'll just let Izmael
know and I'll get the money from him.\e"

I'll show you the beauty of Yafutoman
architecture!\c"
M08150050,"\h(《Kirala》)The fountain? Well, it looks like ol' Izmael
is taking care of that already. Sorry, but it's
a little late for me to take over the job.\c"
M08150051,"\h(《Kirala》)Well, Izmael has already begun his preparations
for remodeling that. I think it's a little late
for me to do anything about it. Sorry.\c"

Need something remodeled?\e"

Where should I start?\e"

What kind do ya want?\e"

It would be an honor to sculpt ya. 
I'll make ya look legendary.\c"

tough, but I love a challenge!\c"

sculpt such a rare beauty!\c"
M14010026,"\h(《Izmael》)Vyse, that face is already on the wall! 
Stop and smell the flowers once in a while. 
You're working too hard.\e"

If ya change your mind, gimmie a holler!\c"
M14010028,"\h(《Izmael》)Captain, you don't have enough money. I'd do it 
for free, but I need to buy supplies and stuff. 
Come back when you have the gold.\c"
M14010029,"\h(《Izmael》)Vyse, I already remodeled that. 
You shouldn't mess with perfection.\c"

Looks like you're getting forgetful in your old
age there! Hahahaha!\e"

I'll get to work right away!\e"
M14010037,"\h(《Izmael》)I'll get the money from Kirala. You don't worry
about a thing, okay? Leave everything up to me!
\c"

I realized just how important Polly was to me.\e"

long time, but it's good to know that Polly
hasn't lost her touch in the kitchen.\e"

learned to appreciate a great meal.\c"
Mp0010000,"\h(《Aika》)Now that we've got our own island base, 
I bet you finally feel like a real captain.
Captain Vyse… I like the sound of that.\e"
Mp0010001,"\h(《Aika》)You've sailed around the world in your own ship!
Not many people can say that they've made their
childhood dreams come true, you know.\e"
Mp0010002,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika, you make it sound like I'm ready to
retire. There's still so much that I haven't
seen yet.\e"
Mp0010003,"\h(《Vyse》)And there's still lots of undiscovered treasure 
to be found. We've got a long way to go!\e"
Mp0010004,"\h(《Aika》)Haha, that's so like you! Don't worry, I'll be
right there with you! Especially, if there's
treasure involved.\c"
Mp0010005,"\h(《Aika》)I'll do my best, Captain Vyse. Haha… 
I like the sound of that. It makes me laugh.\c"
Mp0010006,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, now that we can go higher and lower than 
we ever have before, we can explore all of the 
places where we haven't been yet!\c"

Delphinus by now!\e"

'Prince Pukey', because he was always 
barfing over the side of the ship…\e"

Mp0010011,"\h(《Aika》)I didn't want to believe that my mom and dad 
went to such a horrible place after they died…\e"
Mp0010012,"\h(《Aika》)So, I promised myself that someday, I would
travel to Deep Sky and see it for myself. I
wanted to prove everyone wrong.\c"
Mp0010013,"\h(《Aika》)I hope Fina is ok…
She says she is, 
but she looks really sad… \e"
Mp0010014,"\h(《Aika》)Wasn't Elder Prime like a grandfather to her?
Losing him must have been really hard on her.\c"
Mp0010015,"\h(《Aika》)I never thought Galcian would actually use the
Rains of Destruction!\e"
Mp0010016,"\h(《Aika》)And he did it on his own country, too! 
I can't belive how many people he killed. 
We have to find a way to stop him!\c"
Mp0010022,"\h(《Aika》)So, it all comes down to this battle…
I was so nervous last night that I could barely
sleep.\e"
Mp0010023,"\h(《Aika》)In fact, I was a little scared at first, but
when I thought about all of the Air Pirates that
are here to fight with us, I felt much better.\e"
Mp0010024,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, Vyse, everyone's waiting for us at the
Delphinus! Let's hurry back to the port!\c"
Mp0010025,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, Vyse, everyone's waiting for us at the
Delphinus! Let's hurry back to the port!\c"
Mp0010026,"\h(《Aika》)Good morning Vyse!
Thanks for that little talk last night.
I was able to relax enough to get some sleep.\e"
Mp0010027,"\h(《Aika》)I know we can beat Galcian. I have faith in
everyone… And I have faith in you.\e"
Mp0010028,"\h(《Aika》)I'd face anyone if you were fighting by my side.
I'm sure the rest of the Air Pirates feel the
same way.\e"
Mp0010029,"\h(《Aika》)Heh heh… Let's do out best.
Everyone's counting on you, Vy… I mean
Cap'n Vyse!!!\c"
Mp0010030,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, Vyse, everyone's waiting for us at the
Delphinus! Let's hurry back to the port!\c"
Mp0010017,"\h(《Aika》)I thought everything would be over once we 
defeated Galcian, but it looks like I was wrong,
huh?\e"
Mp0010018,"\h(《Aika》)I'm not scared though, since you're here with
me… and we've made it this far together, right?\e"
Mp0010019,"\h(《Aika》)Ok, let's go beat the snot out of Ramirez so we 
can hurry back to Crescent Isle and throw the
biggest party in history!\c"
Mp0020000,"\h(《Fina》)It's… a very nice island. 
And you even had a room made for me, too.\e"
Mp0020001,"\h(《Fina》)I can't believe it… I actually have my own 
room in your home base…\e"
Mp0020002,"\h(《Fina》)I feel like I am really a member of the 
Blue Rogues. I… I'm so happy. 
Thank you, Vyse.\c"
Mp0020003,"\h(《Fina》)When we last saw him, Drachma said that it
wasn't going to be easy for him to start his
life over…\e"
Mp0020004,"\h(《Fina》)Do you think he will rejoin us, 
when he feels better?\c"
Mp0020005,"\h(《Fina》)We've finally gathered all of the Moon Crystals.
My mission is finally over.
Thank you for all your help.\c"
Mp0020006,"\h(《Fina》)We can finally get into Deep Sky? 
I don't know much about it. 
I'm a little scared… \e"
Mp0020007,"\h(《Fina》)I suppose it's time to look for my ship…
Thank you for all you've done for me…\c"
Mp0020020,"\h(《Fina》)So, the Delphinus will be able to sail into
Deep Sky… I never dreamed that I'd have to go
down there.\c"
Mp0020008,"\h(《Fina》)Enrique is going back to his homeland, Valua…\e"
Mp0020009,"\h(《Fina》)I, too, must return to my homeland once we find 
my ship. I… I feel almost as if I don't want 
to return.\c"
Mp0020010,"\h(《Fina》)I'm all right. I have decided that I have to 
stop mourning, and start fighting. 
We've got to stop Ramirez!\e"
Mp0020011,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez and I… We both were raised by the
Elders in the Great Silver Shrine.\e"
Mp0020012,"\h(《Fina》)Among the Elders, Elder Prime was the most
knowledgable. He knew everything, from 
historical records to current world affairs.\e"
Mp0020013,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez was always the most interested in 
Elder Prime's stories about the Chronicles 
of Arcadia. They'd spend hours together.\e"
Mp0020014,"\h(《Fina》)I think it was Elder Prime's stories that
inspired Ramirez to search for the Crystals. 
I can't believe Ramirez… killed him… \c"
Mp0020015,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse, so many people were killed when the Rains
of Destruction fell on Valua.\e"
Mp0020016,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez and the Silver Gigas, Zelos, are
responsible for this.\e"
Mp0020017,"\h(《Fina》)As a Silvite, I… I should have stopped
Ramirez…\c"
Mp0020021,"\h(《Fina》)The time has come at last to face Ramirez.
To be completely honest, it… it's a little hard
for me to fight him.\e"
Mp0020022,"\h(《Fina》)But, as a Silvite… I must stop him. It is my
duty.\e"
Mp0020023,"\h(《Fina》)I'll do my best to fight. We must not let
Galcian and Ramirez destroy this world.\c"
Mp0020024,"\h(《Fina》)Galcian and Ramirez must be stopped, 
before more innocent lives are lost.\c"
Mp0020025,"\h(《Fina》)Good morning, Vyse.
Um… thank you for everything last night.\e"
Mp0020026,"\h(《Fina》)To be completely honest, it's a little hard for
me to fight against Ramirez. But…\e"
Mp0020027,"\h(《Fina》)I want to fight. I want to help save this world.
I… I want to fight along side of you.\e"
Mp0020028,"\h(《Fina》)That's why I'll try my best. As long as you are
there fighting with me, somehow I believe we'll
win.\c"
Mp0020029,"\h(《Fina》)Let's go, Vyse. Everyone is probably waiting at
the Delphinus for us.\c"
Mp0020018,"\h(《Fina》)Let's go Vyse, we've got to stop Ramirez.\e"
Mp0020019,"\h(《Fina》)For the sake of this world… and for the memory
of Elder Prime, Ramirez must be stopped.\c"
Mp0040000,"\h(《Enrique》)Oh, hello Vyse. For a hidden base, this is most
impressive.\e"
Mp0040001,"\h(《Enrique》)As we acquire more crew members, the base, as
well as the Delphinus, will run more smoothly.\e"
Mp0040002,"\h(《Enrique》)You are the only one, who has the experience 
and the determination to lead this crew to 
victory. We all look up to you, Vyse!\e"
Mp0040003,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, I have entrusted you with the 
Delphinus. Please take good care of it,
I may want it back someday.\c"
Mp0040004,"\h(《Enrique》)I always wondered when I would return to Valua…
But somehow, this isn't quite what I imagined…\c"
Mp0040005,"\h(《Enrique》)We have obtained all the Moon Crystals at last. 
Now I can finally put an end to my mother's
tyranny.\e"
Mp0040006,"\h(《Enrique》)Although we fight on opposing sides, 
she is still my mother.\e"
Mp0040007,"\h(《Enrique》)I hope that I can convince her that what she is 
doing is wrong, and we can come to some
agreement.\c"
Mp0040008,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse… I'm sorry, but could you leave me alone
for a while?\c"
Mp0040015,"\h(《Enrique》)The modifications on the Delphinus should be
complete. Let us return to the port, Vyse.\c"
Mp0040009,"\h(《Enrique》)Come now, Vyse. Do not be so worried. I shall
be fine. I do not plan to die just yet. I
still have a country to lead.\e"
Mp0040010,"\h(《Enrique》)I… I just have one request to ask of you, Vyse.
Please… look after Princess Moegi while I am
gone. She… she means so much to me.\c"
Mp0040011,"\h(《Enrique》)So, it's time to confront Galcian. I shall 
accompany you in the Delphinus.\e"
Mp0040012,"\h(《Enrique》)Galcian must pay for destroying my 
homeland, and killing my mother… 
and Gregorio…\c"
Mp0040013,"\h(《Enrique》)This is it… If we win, the world will 
be at peace. We must win this battle!\e"
Mp0040014,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, you must lead us… lead us to victory!\c"
M01000012,"\h(《Polly》)Welcome, Vyse!
I've prepared all of your favorite dishes!\e"
M01000013,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy food”
“Talk to Polly”
“Leave”\e"
M01000035,"\h(《Polly》)Actually, would you like me to make something
for you that will help you on your mission?\e"
M01000036,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Order a Polly Special.”
“Come back some other time.”\e"
M01000037,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, I've got 10 Grules right here.\e"
M01000038,"\h(《Polly》)Wow, you're always prepared, aren't you Vyse?
Just sit tight, one “Polly Special” comin' right
up!\e"
M01000039,\h(　)You received a “Polly Special.”\c
M01000040,"\h(《Polly》)If you bring me 10 Grules, I'll make you a
“Polly Special.” You'll love it!\c"
M01000041,"\h(《Polly》)Hm? You already have more than enough to eat!
Come back once you've finished what I've cooked
for you already.\c"
M01000042,"\h(《Polly》)Really? Alright. If you ever get hungry, don't
hesitate to come and ask me to make something
for you, okay?\c"
M01000014,"\h(《Polly》)Oh, by the way, I have a special recipe that 
will give you an energy boost, but the 
ingredients are hard to find.\e"
M01000015,"\h(《Polly》)They're “Fang of Urobokos” “Root of Mandragoro”
“Pollen of Blue Rose…”\e"
M01000016,"\h(《Polly》)If you can find these ingredients for me, 
I can make you an elixir that will increase your
Stamina.\c"
M01000017,"\h(《Polly》)You were able to find the ingredients?!
That's great!\e"
M01000018,"\h(《Polly》)I'll make you an elixer that will give you 
a little extra stamina!\e"
M01000019,"\h(《Polly》)Here you go, one Stamina Boost!\e"
M01000020,\h(　)You got 1 Stamina Boost!\e
M01000021,"\h(《Polly》)I'll make you one any time as long as you have
the ingredients!\e"
M01000022,"\h(《Polly》)Drop by any time! I love cooking for people who
appreciate good food.\c"
M08030022,"\h(《Urala》)Um… I just finished making lunch. 
Come in and stay a while.\e"
M08030023,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)“Buy or sell lunch”
“Just talk”
“Exit the shop”\e"
M08030034,"\h(《Urala》)Um… Lunch?
I'll need ＊＊ gold for the ingredients to make
it. Is that alright?\c"
M08030035,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Have Urala make lunch.”
“Come back some other time.”\e"
M08030036,\h(《Vyse》)Sure! I'll take one of your delicious lunches!\e
M08030037,"\h(《Urala》)Really?
Thank you! I'll make it right away!\e"
M08030038,\h(　)You received 1 “Urala's Lunch.”\c
M08030039,"\h(《Urala》)Well… I will make whatever you want, Vyse.
Please feel free to visit anytime.\c"
M08030040,"\h(《Urala》)Um… I'm sorry Vyse, but you don't seem to have
enough gold. Please come back and visit when you
do, okay?\e"
M08030041,\h(《Urala》)Oh… I see…\e
M08030042,"\h(《Urala》)Well… I will make whatever you want, Vyse.
Please feel free to visit anytime.\c"
M08030024,"\h(《Urala》)Um…  don't you visit a lot of places, Vyse?\e"
M08030025,"\h(《Urala》)Um, these are all ingredients, but do you know
what “Mermaid's liver,” “Tsubakurame's Nest,”
and “Winter Insect Summer Grass” are?\e"
M08030026,"\h(《Urala》)If you can find these, I can make you a recipe
that is very good for your health…\e"
M08030027,"\h(《Urala》)Oh, you found all the ingredients for the health
recipe?\e"
M08030028,"\h(《Urala》)Um, thank you very much. I am grateful that you 
went through all of this trouble to collect
ingredients for me… \e"
M08030029,"\h(《Urala》)I will make this recipe for you, Vyse.
Please wait for a while until I am done.\e"
M08030030,"\h(《Urala》)Thank you for waiting.  This is Urala's special
“Life Prolonging medicine.”\e"
M08030031,\h(　)You got one Life Prolonging medicine!\e
M08030032,"\h(《Urala》)Um, I could make this any time as long as you
have the ingredients.\e"
M08030033,"\h(《Urala》)Um…  I'll have your favorite dishes prepared,
so please visit whenever you feel like it.\e"
Ms017f000,"\h(《Vyse》)Gonzales… Your memory will always
be with us. Please watch over us
in our times of need…\c"
Ms017f001,"\h(《Vyse》)Gardens are vital to any sailor.
A lack of vegetables on any voyage can almost
guarantee death to the crew.\c"
Ms017f002,"\h(《Vyse》)Thanks to these guys,
we can eat fresh eggs every day.
And meat once in a while, too.\c"
Ms017f003,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… It'd be nice if we could build
a fountain right around here…\c"
Ms017f004,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
Izmael sure did a good job building
this fountain…\c"
Ms017f005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's hard to think that a girl like
Kirala made this fountain. It certainly
is… interesting.\c"
Ms017f006,"\h(《Vyse》)So this is the Cupil-shaped fountain
that Kirala made. Well, I'm sure at
least Fina likes it.\c"
Ms017f007,"\h(《Vyse》)For some reason, a lot of my crew members don't
like loqua, so we have a lot of juices and
nectars here. Maybe it's a little too bitter…\c"
Ms017f008,"\h(《Vyse》)We've got juices from all over the world and
an assortment of different loquas. Marco
insists that he get his own bottle of nectar…\c"
Ms017f009,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… Looks like stews for dinner tonight.
I'm sure nobody will mind if a have a taste…
Mmm! Pretty good!\c"
Ms017f010,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like Urala has got some vegetables
sitting in this bean paste. It sure looks awful,
but it tastes great when it's done!\c"
Ms017f011,"\h(《Vyse》)Although Yafutoman condiments look a little
strange at first, they're actually quite good
once you get used to them.\c"
Ms017f012,"\h(《Vyse》)There's random piles
of Nasr rugs, small boxes
and other things.\c"
Ms017f013,"\h(《Vyse》)There's polished stones and
booklets with strange designs inside.
Maybe they're used for fortunetelling.\c"
Ms017f014,"\h(《Vyse》)The smoke smells kinda sweet. The smell's
getting stronger… My head's getting woozy…
Okay… maybe I should stop.\c"
Ms017f015,"\h(《Vyse》)There's salt on a small plate.
I wonder what this is for?\c"
Ms017f016,\h(《Vyse》)Maybe I'll rest for a little bit.\e
Ms017f017,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take a short break.”
“Rest later.”\e"
Ms017f018,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I'm not really that tired right now.
Resting can wait.\c"
Ms017f019,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh heh… Enrique's got a picture of
Moegi on his desk!\c"
Ms017f020,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh heh… Enrique's got a picture of
Moegi on his desk!\c"
Ms017f021,"\h(《Vyse》)Someone put my shirt in Enrique's chest
again. Whose turn was it to do
the laundry, anyway?\c"
Ms017f022,"\h(《Vyse》)This is Enrique's diary. Hmm… Nah, it would be
rude to read it. I'm sure there's plenty of
interesting things written in there, though.\c"
Ms017f023,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a picture of Moegi stuffed
inside this box! I think Enrique's in love…\c"
Ms017f024,"\h(《Vyse》)What's this? Aika's got a picture
of me on her desk.
That's kinda embarassing…\c"
Ms017f025,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! What exactly do you think you're doing?
Are you trying to go through my stuff?!\c"
Ms017f125,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a small bandana…
This is the one I gave her when we were kids.
Heh… I didn't know she still had it.\c"
Ms017f026,"\h(《Vyse》)It's Aika's diary…
If I opened it she'd probably
beat me to a pulp.\c"
Ms017f027,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! What exactly do you think you're doing?
Are you trying to go through my stuff?!\c"
Ms017f127,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a small bandana…
This is the one I gave her when we were kids.
Heh… I didn't know she still had it.\c"
Ms017f028,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a stuffed animal.
Aika has loved stuffed animals
ever since she was a kid.\c"
Ms017f029,"\h(《Vyse》)Why does Fina have a picture of me on her desk?
It's a little embarassing…\c"
Ms017f030,"\h(《Fina》)Um, Vyse…
I would appreciate it if you didn't
go through my stuff…\c"
Ms017f130,"\h(《Vyse》)I've always wondered why all of Fina's
clothes are white… Maybe that's just
how Silvites dress…\c"
Ms017f031,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina's mirror… I suppose it's just a little
strange seeing a mirror here… Not too many Air
Pirates care about the way they look, I guess.\c"
Ms017f032,"\h(《Fina》)Um, Vyse…
I would appreciate it if you didn't
go through my stuff…\c"
Ms017f132,"\h(《Vyse》)I've always wondered why all of Fina's
clothes are white… Maybe that's just
how Silvites dress…\c"
Ms017f033,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a book filled with random-looking lines
and badly written letters.\e"
Ms017f034,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess Marco's been trying hard to learn
how to write. Good for him…\c"
Ms017f035,"\h(《Vyse》)I love the smell of roasting sausages
by the fireplace…\c"
Ms017f036,"\h(《Vyse》)This must be the crew's sleeping area.
Once in a while, you can hear someone
fall out of their hammock at night.\c"
Ms017f037,"\h(《Vyse》)I love the smell of roasting sausages
by the fireplace…\c"
Ms017f038,"\h(《Vyse》)Some members of the crew sleep here.
Sometimes you can hear Marco talking
in his sleep… something about Flying Fish…\c"
Ms017f039,"\h(《Vyse》)I love the smell of grilled fish
coming from the fireplace… Makes me
hungry just thinking about it.\c"
Ms017f040,"\h(《Vyse》)This is where the crew sleeps. Even with these
bars, people still somehow manage to fall out
of their hammocks sometimes.\c"
Ms017f050,"\h(《Vyse》)It doesn't look like there's anyone here…
Well, it is a little late. Maybe I'll look
around a little bit more…\c"
Ms017f051,"\h(《Vyse》)Everyone's probably resting up for the big
battle tomorrow. I should probably them
them sleep…\c"
Ms017f052,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey… Aika's not here after all…
I wonder where she's gone off to…\c"
Ms017f053,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder if Aika's gone to sleep yet…
Hmm… I probably shouldn't disturb her. She's
gonna need her rest for tomorrow's battle.\c"
Ms017f054,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina's not in her room…
I guess she isn't asleep after all.
I wonder where she is…\c"
Ms017f055,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder if Fina's gone to sleep yet…
Hmm… I probably shouldn't disturb her. She's
gonna need her rest for tomorrow's battle.\c"
Ms017f056,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… It sounds like Enrique and Moegi are
talking. I probably shouldn't disturb them… I'm
sure they want to be alone…\c"
Ms017f057,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay up a little while longer.”
“Rest up for the big battle.”\e"
Ms017f058,"\h(《Vyse》)I think I'll stay up a little while longer. I
really don't think I could sleep right now if I
tried, anyway…\c"
Ms017f059,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, tomorrow's the big battle…
I should probably try and get some rest.\c"
Ms017f060,"\h(《Vyse》)It's sort of refreshing to see our flag flapping
in the wind like that…\e"
Ms017f061,"\h(《Change the flag?》)“Change it to Aika's design.”
“Change it to Fina's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017f062,"\h(《Change the flag?》)“Change it to my design.”
“Change it to Fina's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017f063,"\h(《Change the flag?》)“Change it to my design.”
“Change it to Aika's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017f065,"\h(《Gilder》)Vyse, I heard a rumor concerning Dangral Island
a little while ago…\e"
Ms017f066,"\h(《Gilder》)According to my sources, Galcian's built some
sort of elevator that leads down beneath the
Great Cloud Sea…\e"
Ms017f067,"\h(《Aika》)Do you think they built it to try and get
to Soltis?!\e"
Ms017f068,"\h(《Gilder》)Probably. And I bet they're heading there with
the Moon Crystals as we speak.\e"
Ms017f069,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, then it looks like we know where we need
to go. Let's try and get to Soltis through
Dangral Island. We need to stop Galcian!\c"
Ms017f073,"\h(　)This feeld belongs to evrybody! So you beter
not be taking any vegetubles without permishun!\e"
Ms017f074,"\h(《Vyse》)Hahaha… Looks like Marco made this sign. He's
been working so hard tending to the garden…
Heh… His spelling could still use some work…\c"
Ms017f075,"\h(　)“Coqueta Coop”
Crew members must take weekly
shifts to care for the Coquetas.\c"
Ms017f076,"\h(《Vyse》)These are Coquetta eggs. They've become a
regular part of our diet here. I like them
scrambled, but Aika likes them sunny-side up.\c"
Ms017f077,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Head for the Great Silver Shrine.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms017f078,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… I don't know if we should head to the
Great Silver Shrine right now. Besides, it's
getting a little late, anway…\c"
MJ0220000,"\h(《Vyse》)Modifications to the Delphinus began on that
day.\e"
MJ0220001,"\h(《Vyse》)We needed 10 days to complete our preparations.
Crescent Isle began to bustle with activity…\e"
MJ0220002,"\h(《Vyse》)Using the blueprints that we took from Valua, 
Brabham was hard at work rebuilding the engine
of the Delphinus.\e"
MJ0220003,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't wait to see what Deep Sky looks like 
with my own eyes.\e"
MJ0220004,"\h(《Vyse》)Far beneath the great, blue sky… beneath the 
clouds… I imagine that the atmospheric
pressure must be high…\e"
MJ0220005,"\h(《Vyse》)We must reinforce the Delphinus' hull to make 
sure that it doesn't collapse under the 
pressure…\e"
MJ0220006,"\h(《Vyse》)Ever since that day…
Enrique began to spend more and more time by 
himself.\e"
MJ0220007,"\h(《Vyse》)Looking back…
Losing Gregorio must have been the hardest thing
Enrique has ever faced…\e"
MJ0220008,"\h(《Vyse》)And then, on the tenth day, night fell on 
Crescent Isle… I remember lying awake in my bed
for a long time before I finally fell asleep.\e"
MJ0220009,"\h(《Vyse》)Ugh… I still don't feel rested. Maybe because I
stayed up all night the day before yesterday 
working on the Delphinus…\e"
MJ0220010,"\h(《Vyse》)I should head over to the port.
If everything went according to schedule, 
the modifications should be finished by now.\e"
ML0040000,\h(《Vyse》)…Who could it be at this time of night?\e
ML0040001,"\h(　)It's me, Vyse.\e"
ML0040002,"\h(《Vyse》)Belleza?
What are you doing up at this time of…\e"
ML0040003,"\h(《Belleza》)I…
I've come to say good-bye.\e"
ML0040004,"\h(《Vyse》)Good-bye?!
You're not going to fight with us?\e"
ML0040005,"\h(《Belleza》)I'm afraid not.
You can't expect me to fight my own men.\e"
ML0040006,"\h(《Belleza》)And besides…
There's something else that I have to take care 
of.\e"
ML0040007,\h(《Vyse》)Something else?\e
ML0040008,\h(《Belleza》)……\e
ML0040009,"\h(《Belleza》)…That reminds me.
I took a peek into Aika and Fina's room earlier.\e"
ML0040010,\h(《Belleza》)Neither of them were there.\e
ML0040011,\h(《Vyse》)Huh? Are you serious?\e
ML0040012,"\h(《Belleza》)They were probably unable to sleep… You know…
the night before a battle… They aren't as tough
as they pretend to be… \e"
ML0040013,\h(《Belleza》)A good captain would find them and comfort them.\e
ML0040014,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh, alright.
I'll go check up on them.\e"
ML0040015,\h(《Belleza》)Heh heh… I figured you would.\e
ML0040016,"\h(《Belleza》)Well then…
I must be on my way.\e"
ML0040017,"\h(《Belleza》)I know you'll grow to be a great leader. 
And try not to break too many hearts. 
Good-bye, Vyse.\e"
ML0050000,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, Aika.\e"
ML0050001,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, hey Vyse.\e"
ML0050002,"\h(《Aika》)It looked like you were talking to Fina… 
How's she doing?\e"
ML0050003,\h(《Vyse》)She seemed a little worried about tomorrow… \e
ML0050004,"\h(《Aika》)Hm…
Fina, too, huh?\e"
ML0050005,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse?
What are you doing up this late?\e"
ML0050006,"\h(《Vyse》)Shouldn't I be asking you that question? 
What are you doing out here?\e"
ML0050007,"\h(《Aika》)Haha… Good point…
I should answer you first, I suppose…\e"
ML0050008,"\h(《Aika》)I don't know…
I crawled into bed, but I couldn't sleep.\e"
ML0050009,"\h(《Aika》)Maybe I'm just scared.
Heh… This isn't like me, I guess…\e"
ML0050010,"\h(《What will you say to Aika?》)“Hey, I'm scared, too.”
“Yeah, it isn't like you at all…”\e"
ML0050011,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, don't worry about it. I'm scared, too.
Tomorrow is going to be our toughest battle, 
yet.\e"
ML0050012,"\h(《Aika》)Really?
I didn't think you ever got scared.\e"
ML0050013,"\h(《Vyse》)Just because I've been placed in charge of 
tomorrow's assault, doesn't mean that 
I'm not afraid of anything anymore… \e"
ML0050014,"\h(《Aika》)Haha… I'm sorry.
We've been through so much. I guess it's hard 
for me to remember you as the kid next door.\e"
ML0050015,"\h(《Aika》)That makes me feel a little better…
that I'm not the only one who's scared
around here… \e"
ML0050016,"\h(《Aika》)There's a lot riding on tomorrow's battle… 
I guess it's normal to be scared.\e"
ML0050017,"\h(《Vyse》)I feel the same way.
Hey, I'll bet Galcian is scared, too.\e"
ML0050018,"\h(《Aika》)Hahaha!
I bet he is!\e"
ML0050019,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, it isn't like you at all. Maybe you should
hide under your bed.\e"
ML0050020,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! I said maybe! I didn't come right out and 
say it. And you don't have to make fun of me.\e"
ML0050021,"\h(《Vyse》)I didn't realize that you had a sensitive side, 
too. I think I like it, though.\e"
ML0050022,"\h(《Aika》)…Heh. The only reason why you didn't realize 
that is because every time I try to talk to you,
this is the kind of reaction that I get.\e"
ML0050023,"\h(《Aika》)I'm starting to feel better. Thanks Vyse. 
You've always known how to cheer me up.\e"
ML0050024,"\h(《Aika》)Maybe I'm just feeling the pressure of 
tomorrow's battle. There's a lot riding on it.\e"
ML0050025,"\h(《Aika》)Maybe I should try to relax. We'll do our best 
and whatever happens, happens… \e"
ML0050026,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah.
Just act like you always do, Aika, and 
everything will be fine.\e"
ML0050027,"\h(《Vyse》)All we have to do is fight like we always do… 
We've done pretty good so far!\e"
ML0050028,\h(《Aika》)Yeah… you're right.\e
ML0050029,"\h(《Aika》)I feel so much better now. Maybe I'll be able to
get some sleep.\e"
ML0050030,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright…
I'll see you tomorrow… \e"
ML0050031,\h(《Aika》)…Okay.\e
ML0050032,"\h(《Aika》)Thanks, Vyse.
We're gonna make history tomorrow!\e"
ML0050033,"\h(《Aika》)Good night!
You better not oversleep! Your Dad's here… 
remember?\e"
ML0060000,\h(《Vyse》)Fina…\e
ML0060001,\h(《Fina》)Vyse…\e
ML0060002,\h(《Vyse》)Can't sleep?\e
ML0060003,\h(《Fina》)I… I tried to… but…\e
ML0060004,\h(《Fina》)…I couldn't stop thinking about Ramirez.\e
ML0060005,"\h(《Fina》)I grew up with him…
My… my whole life, we were always together… 
We were best friends… \e"
ML0060006,"\h(《Fina》)It's… it's hard to think that now I'm going to
have to fight him… and one of us will die
tomorrow… \e"
ML0060007,"\h(《Fina》)As a Silvite, it is my duty, but… \e"
ML0060008,\h(《Fina》)……\e
ML0060009,\h(《Vyse》)Fina…\e
ML0060010,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse.
I have…
I have one thing to ask of you…\e"
ML0060011,\h(《Vyse》)What is it?\e
ML0060012,"\h(《Fina》)Please…
Stay by my side…\e"
ML0060013,"\h(《Fina》)If you are at my side… during tomorrow's
battle… I know I'll be able to fight him.\e"
ML0060014,"\h(《Fina》)You're a great leader… I know you will inspire 
me… \e"
ML0060015,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Say comforting words.”
“Say nothing and just put your arm around her.”\e"
ML0060016,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure.
I'll be by your side.\e"
ML0060017,\h(《Fina》)Vyse… Thank you!\e
ML0060018,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, I'll be there for you. This, I promise.\e"
ML0060019,\h(《Vyse》)We'll fight together!\e
ML0060020,\h(《Fina》)…Yes.\e
ML0060021,\h(《Fina》)Vyse…\e
ML0060022,\h(《Fina》)…Thank you.\e
ML0060023,\h(《Vyse》)…Feel better now?\e
ML0060024,"\h(《Fina》)…Yes.
Having you here means a lot to me.\e"
ML0060025,\h(《Fina》)Can we stay like this a little longer…?\e
