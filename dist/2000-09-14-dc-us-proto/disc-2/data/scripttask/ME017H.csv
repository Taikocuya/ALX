M02000000,"\h(《Marco》)No… Why…
Everything we've worked so hard for is gone.\e"
M02000003,"\h(《What will you say to Marco?》)“We'll just have to rebuild our base.”
“Stop crying.”\e"
M02000004,"\h(《Vyse》)We'll just have to rebuild our base. We did it 
before and we can do it again. The important 
thing is that no one got seriously hurt.\e"
M02000005,"\h(《Vyse》)If we all give Izmael a hand, we'll have our
base back up in no time. I'm sure Izmael sees
this as a chance to improve on the old one.\e"
M02000006,"\h(《Marco》)Yeah, you're right.
Everyone is okay. 
I guess we can just rebuild our base.\e"
M02000007,"\h(《Marco》)I'm going to do my best…
And I might learn a few more things 
from Izmael, too!\c"
M02000008,"\h(《Vyse》)Stop crying.
We've got a lot of work to do here.\e"
M02000009,"\h(《Vyse》)We just lost a few buildings. 
They can be rebuilt. You'll never be 
an Air Pirate if you act like this.\e"
M02000010,"\h(《Marco》)Yeah, you're right!
I can't let something like this stand in 
my way if I'm going to be an Air Pirate.\e"
M02000011,\h(《Marco》)I'm going to do my best!\c
M02000012,\h(《Marco》)What? I said that I'll do my best.\c
M02000001,"\h(《Marco》)You're going to the Silver Shrine?
Good luck, Vyse. I wish I could go, too.\e"
M02000002,"\h(《Marco》)But I need to stay here. 
There's a lot that we need to do.\c"
M08070000,"\h(《Moegi》)I… I am so scared…
What are we supposed to do if 
the Armada attacks us again?\e"
M08070001,"\h(《Moegi》)Oh, I wish Enrique was here… 
I know he would keep me safe.\c"
M08070004,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Moegi, you're safe now…”
“Calm down!”\e"
M08070005,"\h(《Vyse》)Moegi, you're safe now. That's what matters 
most. I had to give up the Crystals in order to 
save everyone, but we're all okay.\e"
M08070006,"\h(《Vyse》)I'll do everything I can to protect the lives of
my crew. \e"
M08070007,"\h(《Moegi》)You are right, Vyse.
I am sorry. I am just so worried about Enrique.
He is out there by himself.\e"
M08070008,"\h(《Moegi》)I will be brave. For you, your crew, 
and Enrique.\c"
M08070009,"\h(《Vyse》)Calm down, Moegi!
Enrique is in Valua right now,
by himself.\e"
M08070010,"\h(《Vyse》)He needs you to be strong for him.
You've got to have faith that he'll
come back for you.\c"
M08070011,"\h(《Moegi》)You are right. I… 
I am sorry.\e"
M08070012,"\h(《Moegi》)I will be brave, for you, your crew, 
and Enrique.\c"
M08070013,"\h(《Moegi》)I will do my best to help you.
I have faith in you, Vyse, and I know
Enrique will come back for me.\c"
M08070002,"\h(《Moegi》)I heard that you are going to the place where
Fina is from.\e"
M08070003,"\h(《Moegi》)Have a safe journey.
We will take care of the island 
while you are gone.\c"
M08150000,"\h(《Kirala》)It's frustrating… It took us so long to build 
our base, and the Armada burned it to the 
ground in a few minutes.\e"
M08150003,"\h(《What will you say to Kirala?》)“We'll all help rebuild.”
“Now we have a chance to make it better!”\e"
M08150004,"\h(《Vyse》)We'll all help rebuild our base.
We already built it once before… 
The second time should be easier!\e"
M08150005,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, Kirala, here's your chance to show everyone
the finest in Yafutoman Craftmanship. This was
just a minor setback. Don't let it get you down.\e"
M08150006,"\h(《Kirala》)Ha, sure thing.
Thanks, Captain… for cheering me up.\e"
M08150007,"\h(《Kirala》)Alright, listen up everyone! We're gonna 
rebuild this base and I'm gonna work you really
hard, but it will all be worth it! Got it?!\c"
M08150008,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, some of the crew members were complaining 
that our old roofs leaked and stuff. Now's our 
chance to build a better base!\e"
M08150009,"\h(《Kirala》)Haha…
I've met some optimistic people before, 
but Vyse, you put them all to shame.\e"
M08150010,"\h(《Kirala》)But you're right! We're gonna rebuild 
our base and it's gonna be better than ever!\c"
M08150011,"\h(《Kirala》)We've got a big job ahead of us. 
Before the sun sets, we need 
to clean up all the debris!\c"
M08150001,"\h(《Kirala》)We'll have this place fixed up 
before you guys get back 
from the Silver Shrine.\e"
M08150002,"\h(《Kirala》)Okay… now everyone's gonna see what Yafutoman
builders are made of!\c"
M14000000,"\h(《Izmael》)Shu Bum Bummm…
There's hardly anything left!
What should we do?\c"
M14000003,"\h(《Vyse》)“Izmael, you live for this kind of stuff!”
“Let's start with the debris.”\e"
M14000004,"\h(《Vyse》)Izmael, you live for this kind of stuff! Here's 
your chance to make some improvements to
the base!\e"
M14000005,"\h(《Vyse》)Bam Bam Baaam!!!  You want something built, I 
build it! You don't want something built…\e"
M14000006,"\h(《Izmael》)I build it anyway!
Thanks, Vyse. I guess I just needed a little 
reminder. I AM the greatest!\e"
M14000007,"\h(《Izmael》)Alright then, I'd better get started! You'll 
love it! Your base is going to be better 
than ever!\c"
M14000008,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's start with the debris.
Throw everything we can't use over the side, 
and start working with what's left.\e"
M14000009,"\h(《Vyse》)The important thing is that everyone is safe!
If we all work together, we can do it!\e"
M14000010,"\h(《Izmael》)Absolutely.
Brabham and I built this place from scratch,
by ourselves.\e"
M14000011,"\h(《Izmael》)If everyone helps out, we'll have this place 
looking as good as new in a jiffy!
Great, I'm starting to talk like Brabham!\e"
M14000012,"\h(《Izmael》)Alright, everyone! We can do this! The 
foundations are still intact! Let's move the 
debris out of the way so we can start building! \c"
M14000001,"\h(《Izmael》)Vyse, leave the base to us! 
It's in good hands!\e"
M14000002,"\h(《Izmael》)By the time you get back here, this place will 
look as good as new!\c"
M14000002,"\h(《Aika…》)Vyse… everyone is really upset right now. 
They could use some cheering up.\e"
Mp0010000,"\h(《Aika》)Especially Fina… She's been in our meeting 
room for a long time now. I think you 
should go check up on her.\c"
Mp0010002,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, I really think you should start comforting
your crew. They all look pretty miserable.\c"
Mp0010001,"\h(《Aika》)Fina's ship is by the flagpole! 
It's ready when you are!\c"
Mp0020000,"\h(《Fina》)Let's go, Vyse.
The Great Silver Shrine awaits us.\c"
Ms017h000,\h(《Vyse》)It's been burned beyond recognition…\c
Ms017h001,"\h(《Vyse》)Izmael's building materials are covered with
soot, but they look usable. It'll still be a
lot of work to rebuild everything, though.\c"
Ms017h002,"\h(《Vyse》)The tent and all the stuff
that was in it was burned.\c"
Ms017h003,"\h(《Vyse》)Kalifa's tent and fortunetelling
stuff were all burned. She's going
be pretty upset…\c"
Ms017h004,"\h(《Vyse》)Our house was burned down, too. Well, I'm just
glad that everyone is still okay. We can always
rebuild everything…\c"
Ms017h005,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn it!
I can't believe Ramirez burned our flag!
He's going to pay…\c"
Ms017h006,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder if Gonzales was wondering what
all the commotion was about…\c"
Ms017h007,"\h(《Vyse》)All right…
Time to head to the Great Silver Shrine!\e"
Ms017h008,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Set sail for the Great Silver Shrine.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms017h009,"\h(《Vyse》)Maybe I should check up on everyone to
see how they're doing first…\c"
MK0030000,"\h(《Vyse》)Valuan scum!
How did they find our base?!\e"
MK0030001,\h(　)If you must know…\e
MK0030002,\h(《Vyse》)Ramirez!\e
MK0030003,"\h(《Ramirez》)A patrol ship spotted the Delphinus when you 
came to Dangral… and they followed you back 
here.\e"
MK0030004,"\h(《Ramirez》)But I have no interest in you or any of your
crew… There is another　purpose for my…
visit.\e"
MK0030005,"\h(《Ramirez》)I am here for the Crystals. Hand them over, now.\e"
MK0030006,"\h(《Ramirez》)If you hand them over peacefully, I will 
call off my troops. If not, we will bombard 
your pitiful island until you are all dead.\e"
MK0030007,"\h(《What will you say?》)“You'll have to kill us!”
“I will trade them for the lives of my crew.”\e"
MK0030008,"\h(《Vyse》)Did you think we'd just hand them over?!
You'll have to kill us!\e"
MK0030009,"\h(《Ramirez》)Nothing would make me happier.
Now… you will die.\e"
MK0030010,"\h(《Vyse》)I will trade them for the lives of my crew.  
Call off your troops and I'll give them to you.\e"
MK0030011,"\h(《Ramirez》)Heh… I did not expect the Legendary Vyse of the
Blue Rogues to fold so easily. But, it is a wise
choice.\e"
MK0030012,"\h(《Ramirez》)As promised, I will spare your lives. Hand over
the Crystals.\e"
MK0040000,"\h(《Ramirez》)At last, all of the Crystals are mine!\e"
MK0040001,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez, wait!\e"
MK0040002,"\h(《Fina》)Why…?
Why are you doing this?\e"
MK0040003,"\h(《Ramirez》)Fina…
The people of this world don't deserve to live.\e"
MK0040004,"\h(《Ramirez》)Like you, I was sent to here to gather the
Crystals.\e"
MK0040005,"\h(《Ramirez》)Shortly after I arrived, I discovered the Valuan
Empire was also searching for them.
They were relentless.\e"
MK0040006,"\h(《Ramirez》)I knew they would eventually find them. After
Valua's forces retrieved the Crystals, I was
going to steal them and return to the Shrine.\e"
MK0040007,"\h(《Ramirez》)While I was in Valua, I learned a great deal 
about the people of this world… 
and what motivates them.\e"
MK0040008,"\h(《Ramirez》)Greed… Hatred… Bigotry… They only value
material items that can be bought with gold.
The people of this world are shallow and petty.\e"
MK0040009,"\h(《Ramirez》)I lost all hope for them.
I began to despise these loathsome creatures.\e"
MK0040010,"\h(《Ramirez》)But, there was one…
One that was different from all the rest… 
Lord Galcian.\e"
MK0040011,"\h(《Ramirez》)Lord Galcian was swayed neither by flattery nor
gold. He also had little faith in the people of
this world.\e"
MK0040012,\h(《Ramirez》)Only one thing mattered to him… that was power.\e
MK0040013,"\h(《Ramirez》)Lord Galcian convinced me that this world needed
a single ruler. One who could slaughter the weak
and lead the strong.\e"
MK0040014,"\h(《Ramirez》)He showed me the meaning of true power.
The one who holds all the power can end lives,
destroy cities, and change the world.\e"
MK0040015,"\h(《Ramirez》)A man like Galcian needs to rule this world.
Only he can unlock its potential. \e"
MK0040016,"\h(《Ramirez》)I swore an oath.
I would lay down my sword and my life for
Lord Galcian.\e"
MK0040017,"\h(《Ramirez》)We now hold all of the Crystals.
With these, a power greater than the the Gigas
will be brought back to this world.\e"
MK0040018,\h(《Ramirez》)Now all of you will bow before him.\e
MK0040019,"\h(《What will you say?》)“You're a fool to underestimate us.”
“What power are you talking about?!”\e"
MK0040020,"\h(《Vyse》)You're a fool to underestimate us.
Do you think we'll just let you get away with
this?\e"
MK0040021,"\h(《Ramirez》)Fools…
What can you do without the Moon Crystals?\e"
MK0040022,\h(《Ramirez》)You don't even know their true purpose… \e
MK0040023,\h(《Vyse》)What are you talking about?!\e
MK0040024,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you mean by a power greater than the
Gigas?!\e"
MK0040025,"\h(《Ramirez》)Ahh, yes… 
You were collecting the Crystals without knowing
their true purpose.\e"
MK0040026,"\h(《Ramirez》)The power to call down the Rains of Destruction
lies hidden within them.\e"
MK0040027,"\h(《Ramirez》)Fina… you knew that it was our people that
called down the Rains of Destruction,
did you not?\e"
MK0040028,"\h(《Fina》)What?!
That…
That's a lie!\e"
MK0040029,"\h(《Ramirez》)We were not sent here to prevent the Gigas from 
being revived. We were sent here so the Elders 
could unearth the Lost Continent of Soltis.\e"
MK0040030,"\h(《Ramirez》)That is our true mission!
Once the six Moon Crystals are combined, 
the Lost Continent shall rise from Deep Sky.\e"
MK0040031,"\h(《Ramirez》)But, now I work for Galcian. Together, we will 
raise the Lost Continent, and with it, unleash 
the Rains of Destruction ourselves.\e"
MK0040032,"\h(《Aika》)I don't know what you mean by Lost Continent,
but aren't you people forgetting something?\e"
MK0040033,"\h(《Aika》)You only have five of the Crystals.
The battle isn't over until you have all six!\e"
MK0040034,"\h(《Ramirez》)You are correct… 
But, you don't know about the sixth Crystal…
the Silver Crystal…\e"
MK0040035,\h(《Ramirez》)Watch closely… \e
MK0040036,\h(《Vyse》)What the?!\e
MK0040037,"\h(《Aika》)In… his hand?  
The Silver Crystal?!\e"
MK0040038,\h(《Fina》)Aahh!\e
MK0040039,\h(《Aika》)Fina!!\e
MK0040040,"\h(《Ramirez》)All Silvites are born with a piece of the Silver
Crystal within them.\e"
MK0040041,"\h(《Ramirez》)In other words… the Silver Crystal contains our
life force. Only through death, can the Crystal
be retrieved from our bodies.\e"
MK0040042,"\h(《Ramirez》)Unlike Teodora, we are not interested in Fina's
knowledge of the ancients… \e"
MK0040043,"\h(《Ramirez》)We are interested in the Crystal within her
body! Fina, you shall give me the sixth
Crystal… \e"
MK0040044,\h(《Aika》)He's killing Fina!!!\e
MK0040045,\h(《Vyse》)Fina!\e
MK0040046,"\h(《Ramirez》)Come, Fina…
Give your life to Lord Galcian!\e"
MK0040047,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh… 
It's a good thing that guy's long winded… \e"
MK0040048,"\h(《Clara》)Hang on!
We got you covered!\e"
MK0040049,\h(《Ramirez》)… Pests… \e
MK0040050,"\h(《Ramirez》)Nevertheless, I got what I came for.
I can get the Silver Crystal anytime I please…\e"
MK0040051,"\h(《Ramirez》)The Crystals are ours!!!
Farewell.\e"
MK0040052,\h(《Aika》)Fina!!!\e
MK0040053,"\h(《Vyse》)You'll pay for this Ramirez… 
You will pay… \e"
MK0040054,\h(　)You gave the 5 Moon Crystals to Ramirez.\e
MK0070000,\h(《Vyse》)We made a lot of progress in one day. \e
MK0070001,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah, but it'll be a while before we can get 
this place looking like it used to.\e"
MK0070002,"\h(《Aika》)I remember when we used to watch the sunset on 
Pirate Isle. You used to always talk about being
the Captain of your own ship… \e"
MK0070003,"\h(《Vyse》)…Hahaha… Yeah… I remember… 
And sailing beyond the sunset.\e"
MK0070004,\h(《Aika》)We've… we've come quite a long way since then.\e
MK0070005,"\h(《Aika》)And because we've come so far, we can't just 
give up now, right?\e"
MK0070006,"\h(《Vyse》)You're right.
Our journey isn't over yet.\e"
MK0070007,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse…
Aika…\e"
MK0070008,\h(《Aika》)Fina!!\e
MK0070009,"\h(《Fina》)I'm sorry… If I caused all of you to worry
about me… \e"
MK0070010,\h(《Vyse》)…Are you okay now?\e
MK0070011,"\h(《Fina》)Yes, I feel a lot better… 
Actually… I, I have a favor to ask of you.\e"
MK0070012,"\h(《Fina》)Will you…
Will both of you come with me to the Great 
Silver Shrine?\e"
MK0070013,\h(《Aika》)What?!\e
MK0070014,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez was saying that in order to call down 
the Rains of Destruction, he needs all of the 
Moon Crystals.\e"
MK0070015,"\h(《Fina》)I thought that the Crystals were only used
to control the Gigas. I didn't know that they 
could call down the Rains of Destruction.\e"
MK0070016,"\h(《Fina》)And I had no idea that my own people were the
ones who were responsible for the deaths of 
millions.\e"
MK0070017,"\h(《Fina》)…I… even have a piece of the Silver Crystal 
inside my body… \e"
MK0070018,"\h(《Fina》)Everything the Elders told me… 
My whole life… 
has been a lie.\e"
MK0070019,"\h(《Fina》)I want to know…
I need to know the truth… 
about the Crystals… about my people… \e"
MK0070020,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse… Aika…
I'll ask you again like I did so long ago… 
Will you travel with me?\e"
MK0070021,"\h(《What will you say?》)”Of course we will!”
”We'll go anywhere with you, Fina!”\e"
MK0070022,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course we will!
Even if you didn't want us to, we'd go with you
anyway!\e"
MK0070023,"\h(《Aika》)No matter what happens, Fina, we'll always be 
your friends!\e"
MK0070024,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, we'll go anywhere with you! 
Even to the Great Silver Shrine!\e"
MK0070025,\h(《Aika》)Let's figure all of this stuff out… together.\e
MK0070026,"\h(《Fina》)Thank you…
Thank you both so very much!\e"
MK0070027,"\h(　)Hey now… you guys weren't planning on leaving
me behind, were you?\e"
MK0070028,\h(《Vyse》)Gilder!\e
MK0070029,"\h(《Gilder》)I don't know, but it sounds like things are just
about to get interesting.\e"
MK0070030,"\h(《Gilder》)You didn't think that I'd just sit back and let
you have all the fun, did you?\e"
MK0070031,"\h(《Aika》)Heh… well, it looks like we've got a party 
again.\e"
MK0070032,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright… let's rest up today.
We leave for the Great Silver Shrine tomorrow!\e"
MK0070033,\h(《Aika & Fina》)Yes!\e
MK0070034,\h(　)Gilder has joined your party.\e
MK0230000,\h(《Vyse》)No!!! It's all on fire!\e
MK0230001,\h(《Aika》)Vyse! Look out!\e
MK0230002,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Heh heh heh… 
Nice place you had here.
Pity that it's burning to the ground.\e"
MK0230003,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)We would have asked you to surrender, 
but we decided that it would 
be more fun to kill you.\e"
MK0240000,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!
I just finished putting out the last fire.
This is horrible!\e"
MK0240001,"\h(《Vyse》)I know. Everything that we've worked so hard for
is… gone.\e"
MK0240002,"\h(《Vyse》)Our base…
It's in ruins… \e"
MK0240003,"\h(《Aika》)And we lost all of the Crystals. The Delphinus 
isn't powerful enough to invade Valua either. 
What are we supposed to do now?\e"
MK0240004,"\h(《What will you say?》)“I will not give up!”
“We'll steal the Crystals back!”\e"
MK0240005,\h(《Vyse》)I will not give up!\e
MK0240006,"\h(《Vyse》)We're Air Pirates, remember?
We'll just steal the Crystals back!\e"
MK0240007,\h(《Aika》)Vyse… I…\e
MK0240008,"\h(《Vyse》)It's not going to be easy, but we can rebuild 
our base. As for the Crystals… well, at least
we know they're all in the same place.\e"
MK0240009,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't give up, Aika. If we give up, then Ramirez
will destroy the entire world. We have to keep
fighting. There's always a way!\e"
MK0240010,\h(《Aika》)…Yeah.\e
MK0240011,"\h(《Aika》)You're right. At one point, this was a deserted
island… And you were stranded here by yourself.\e"
MK0240012,"\h(《Vyse》)Exactly.
That reminds me… how is Fina?\e"
MK0240013,"\h(《Aika》)Well…
Actually, ever since Ramirez left, she's been up
in the meeting room by herself…\e"
MK0240014,"\h(《Aika》)I think everything that happened yesterday was a
little too much for her. Vyse, why don't you try
and talk to her?\e"
MK0240015,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't imagine what she's going through…
Yeah, I'll go talk to her.\e"
