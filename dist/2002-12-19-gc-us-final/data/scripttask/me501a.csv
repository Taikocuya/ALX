“I quit.”\c"
MA5010000,"\h(《Valuan Cruiser》)We got a warning about you Air Pirates
from the Coliseum guards.
You're not getting through here!\c"
MA5010001,"\h(《Drachma》)Boy, the Harpoon Cannon takes a lot of Spirit
Points to fire. Also, you can only fire it
when the target is in the right place.\e"
MA5010002,"\h(《Drachma》)So, attack the enemy with your normal cannons
and build up your Spirit. And when the time is
right, unleash the Harpoon Cannon!\c"
MA5010003,"\h(《Drachma》)In order to use the Harpoon Cannon, after you've
built up enough Spirit Points, you need to use
the “S.Cannon” command.\e"
MA5010004,"\h(《Drachma》)But, regardless of your spirit level, you won't
be able to use the “S.Cannon” command
unless you have a clear shot at your enemy.\e"
MA5010005,"\h(《Drachma》)You can only use the “S.Cannon” command on
turns with a special marker at the top of the
column. So keep your eyes open!\c"
