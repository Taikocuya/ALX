ME0070000,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)I am sorry. I was not expecting guests.
I am the king of Ixa'taka.\e"
ME0070001,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)So, you are the people that have come from the
Eastern skies. The high priests informed me of
your arrival.\e"
ME0070002,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)They also told me that you drove off the fire-
breathing ship that was destroying our land.\e"
ME0070003,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)I thank you on behalf of my people, the forests,
and Quetya.\e"
ME0070004,"\h(《Aika》)It was nothing… really…
We were just doing what we thought was the right
thing to do.\e"
ME0070005,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)I was driven from my land and forced to live in 
this… hut. I am sorry, but I am not in the 
position to compensate you for your bravery.\e"
ME0070006,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)However, I will do anything that is within my 
power as king to reward you. Is there 
anything I can do for you?\e"
ME0070007,"\h(《Vyse》)Actually, your Majesty, we did have something to
ask of you. We are looking for 
the Green Moon Crystal…\e"
ME0070008,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)The Green Moon Crystal?
Perhaps you speak of the 
legendary Sacred Green Stone.\e"
ME0070009,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)The men from Valua came looking for the same 
thing, but I don't know where it is.\e"
ME0070010,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)However, if the Stone did exist, it would 
probably be located in the Lost City of Rixis.\e"
ME0070011,\h(《Aika》)Lost City?\e
ME0070012,"\h(《Fina》)Rixis…
I believe that was the name of the capital of 
Ixa'taka in the Old World.\e"
ME0070013,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)You are correct. And it is said that the 
buildings… even the streets were made 
of pure gold.\e"
ME0070014,"\h(《Aika》)Gold?!?!?!?!?
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
Let's find Rixis right now! \e"
ME0070015,"\h(《Vyse》)Calm down, Aika. You're embarassing me.
So, do you know where Rixis is located?\e"
ME0070016,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)I'm afraid not. It has been hidden for 
generations… Our people call it the 
City of Mists. It may not even exist anymore…\e"
ME0070017,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)One of my High Priests knows a great deal about
the Old World. His name is Isapa. If anyone 
would know, it would be him.\e"
ME0070018,"\h(《Vyse》)I see…
Would it be alright for us to meet Isapa?\e"
ME0070019,\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Hmm… Isapa is not here.\e
ME0070020,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)The Valuans took him to Sacred Mountain… 
In the mountain is a mine that contains 
what you call “Moon Stones”.\e"
ME0070021,"\h(《Aika》)So, the Valuans kidnapped one of your High 
Priests and he's being held prisoner in 
Moon Stone Mountain… Vyse, what should we do?\e"
ME0070022,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Let's break into the Moon Stone Mines!”
“We'll try and find Rixis by ourselves!”\e"
ME0070023,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's break into the Moon Stone Mines! 
We can try to save Isapa!\e"
ME0070024,"\h(《Drachma》)Hmm… it appears to be our only option.
Breaking into a Valuan stronghold isn't 
going to be easy.\e"
ME0070025,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)You're willing to risk your lives to save 
Isapa?\e"
ME0070026,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Our Sacred Mountain is south 
of the Horteka Village. Be careful…\e"
ME0070027,"\h(《Vyse》)Leave it to us!
Onward to Moon Stone Mountain!\e"
ME0070028,"\h(《Vyse》)Rixis has to be somewhere on this island. 
Let's try finding it ourselves!\e"
ME0070029,"\h(《Drachma》)Don't be foolish, boy.
These islands are huge, and the forests are 
thick. We'll never find it in time.\e"
ME0070030,"\h(《Drachma》)The Valuans were desperate enough to burn down
the forests, and they still couldn't find it.\e"
ME0070031,"\h(《Aika》)Looks like we have no choice but to go to
Moon Stone Mountain and save Isapa!\e"
ME0070032,"\h(《Vyse》)I suppose so…
Well, I guess we're going to have to break into 
the mines and rescue him!\e"
ME0070033,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)The Mountain is south of Horteka Village. 
May Quetya protect you.\e"
ME0140000,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Vyse!
You returned safely!\e"
ME0140001,\h(《King Ixa'taka》)I thank you for saving Isapa!\e
ME0140002,"\h(《Isapa》)Heh heh heh…
Yes, thank you for rescuing me. 
I'd love to thank you two ladies personally… \e"
ME0140003,"\h(《Isapa》)But I must return to my priestly duties… 
Well, it was nice meeting you.\e"
ME0140004,"\h(《Aika》)Not so fast! You were supposed to tell us the
location of the Lost City!\e"
ME0140005,"\h(《Isapa》)Ah, that's right.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot… Ahahahaha!\e"
ME0140006,"\h(《Vyse》)King Ixa'taka, with all due respect…
Where did you get this guy?
Is he really a High Priest?\e"
ME0140007,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Of course! He has much knowledge in ancient 
scriptures and history.\e"
ME0140008,"\h(《Isapa》)Very well… I shall pass on to you the secret of
the Lost City that has been passed down in my
family for many generations.\e"
ME0140009,"\h(《Isapa》)“The Great Bird with its wings spread and the
kneeling Golden Man will open the way.”\e"
ME0140010,"\h(《Isapa》)That is all.
So, you got it?\e"
ME0140011,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you mean, “That is all?”
I have no idea what you were talking about.\e"
ME0140012,"\h(《Isapa》)To be completely honest,
I don't know what it means either!\e"
ME0140013,"\h(《Isapa》)You need to solve the riddle on your own.
Ahahaha!!!\e"
ME0140014,"\h(《Aika》)I give up!
If you didn't know, then you should've said so
in the first place!!!\e"
ME0140015,"\h(《Fina》)Now, calm down Aika… 
Listen to what he just told us.\e"
ME0140016,"\h(《Fina》)“The Great Bird with its wings spread and the
kneeling Golden Man will open the way.”\e"
ME0140017,\h(《Fina》)I know what it means!\e
ME0140018,"\h(《Fina》)“The Great Bird with its wings spread” and
“the kneeling Golden Man” are probably
somewhere on this continent!\e"
ME0140019,"\h(《Vyse》)So, if we find them, we'll find the Lost City!\e"
ME0140020,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright, let's go find this Great Bird and the
Golden Man.\e"
ME0230000,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Vyse…
You saved my people… and our lands. 
I don't know how to repay you…\e"
ME0230001,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)We were wrong. We should have never summoned 
the Giant.\e"
ME0230002,"\h(《Vyse》)With great power, you need great responsibility.
The Gigas are far too dangerous…\e"
ME0230003,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Yes, we now realize that. And I am truly sorry…
Vyse, you have proven yourself worthy…\e"
ME0230004,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)I entrust our Sacred Green Stone unto you. 
Use it to achieve peace… 
We have faith in you.\e"
ME0230005,"\h(《Vyse》)Thank you King Ixa'taka…
We will do our best.\e"
ME0230006,"\h(《Isapa》)The Valuans have abandoned their encampments
to the north.\e"
ME0230007,"\h(《Isapa》)Now that they have left, perhaps you might
be able to travel through the Iron Net.\e"
ME0230008,"\h(《Drachma》)If we pass through there, we'll reach North
Ocean. That will take us back to Valua.\e"
ME0230009,\h(《Fina》)The Yellow Crystal should be hidden there. \e
ME0230010,"\h(《Vyse》)Okay everyone, now we'll head back to Valua.
They're really upset with us now… Getting the
Yellow Crystal isn't going to be easy.\e"
ME0230011,"\h(《Isapa》)Sounds dangerous… perhaps you ladies would like
to stay behind here in Ixa'taka?\e"
ME0230012,"\h(《Isapa》)It's an island paradise…
We've got exotic foods, nectars, waterfalls,
beautiful sunsets…\e"
ME0230013,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you say, Aika?
Who knows? Maybe you'll find some more 
ghosts, too.\e"
ME0230014,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!!! Don't even joke about them around me…
You know I'm afraid of them… I've had enough
ghosts to last me for a long time.\e"
ME0230015,\h(　)You received the “Green Moon Crystal.”\e
M05260000,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Maybe it would be best to ask the High Priest
Isapa about Rixis and the Sacred Green Stone.\e"
M05260001,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)But Isapa has been taken to Moon Stone
Mountain, which Valua has taken over. I have
been at a loss over what to do, myself.\c"
M05260002,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Thanks to you and your friends, Isapa has
returned home safely to Ixa'taka.\e"
M05260003,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Please feel free to ask Isapa anything about
Rixis that you wish to know.\c"
M05260004,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Thank you, Vyse. Your bravery has saved my
kingdom.\e"
M05260005,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)From this day forth, we will defend Ixa'taka
from all foes with our own strength! You have
given us the courage to do so, Vyse.\c"
M05260006,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Hello, Vyse! I am glad to see that you are well!
Please, take your time and enjoy our beautiful
country while you are here.\c"
M05260007,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)I see that the winds of fate have blown your
ship once again to the lands of Ixa'taka.\e"
M05260008,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)W, what?! You say that you have traveled
around the world and come from the west!?!\e"
M05260009,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)I… I cannot believe it… To think that the Wall
of Rock is not the edge of the world…\c"
M05260010,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Well, if it isn't Vyse. We are forever in your
debt, brave one. I am glad to see that fate has
left you in good health.\e"
M05260011,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Thanks to you, the forests are quiet and the
citizens of Ixa'taka can once again live in
peace. You are truly heroes.\c"
M05260012,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Vyse…
I have heard that terrible things are happening
in the east.\c"
M05270000,"\h(《High Priest》)Our kingdom has been destroyed. Even the king is
forced to live in conditions not fit for
beasts… and as old as I am, I can do nothing.\e"
M05270001,"\h(《High Priest》)Perhaps you cannot tell by looking at him, but 
Isapa is a High Priest of much higher standing 
than myself.\e"
M05270002,"\h(《High Priest》)He knows much about ancient legends and is a 
valuable member of the royal court…\e"
M05270003,"\h(《High Priest》)Your ship… it is a different ship from the one 
you came in last time you visited us. What has 
happened?\e"
M05270004,"\h(《High Priest》)Y, you stole it from Valua?!
You… you are just too much…\e"
M05270005,"\h(《High Priest》)A little while back, Valua came through here 
from the east. We were all very surprised.\e"
M05270006,"\h(《High Priest》)But, they continued on without doing anything. 
They flew to the west. What exactly were they up
to?\e"
M05270007,"\h(《High Priest》)Rumors of your exploits have traveled even to
us here in Ixa'taka. It appears that you are
quite the sailor.\c"
M05270008,"\h(《High Priest》)There was a big sound to the east of here.
What happened over there?\e"
M05280000,"\h(《High Priest》)The Valuans have made Moon Stone Mountain into
their headquarters.\e"
M05280001,"\h(《High Priest》)Moon Stone Mountain is south of Horteka.
If you plan on going, be careful.\c"
M05280002,"\h(《High Priest》)Rixis?
…I'm sorry, I… I do not know anything.\c"
M05280003,"\h(《High Priest》)We all actually knew the location of Rixis.
I'm sorry for having lied to you.\e"
M05280004,"\h(《High Priest》)I thank you for facing the Giant of the Forest.
If he was left unchallenged, he would have 
destroyed us all.\e"
M05280005,"\h(《High Priest》)There is a country to the west?
I don't believe you!\e"
M05280006,"\h(《High Priest》)The Wall of Rock to the west is the edge of the
world. There can't be anything on the other side
of it!\e"
M05280008,\h(《High Priest》)I feel a great power from the east…\e
M05280009,"\h(《High Priest》)It feels even more powerful than when Grendel
was summoned. Much, much more powerful…\c"
M05290000,"\h(《Isapa》)“The Great Bird with the spread wings and the
kneeling Golden Man point the way to Rixis.”\e"
M05290001,"\h(《Isapa》)This is the legend of Rixis that has been
passed down from the ancients.\e"
M05290002,"\h(《Isapa》)The Valuans escaped these lands to the northeast
between the mountains.\e"
M05290003,"\h(《Isapa》)Before, we weren't able to get into Valua 
because of the Iron Net, but now we should be 
able to.\e"
M05290004,"\h(《Isapa》)Ladies, although sailing is fine in its own 
ways, perhaps you would consider settling down 
in our green and fertile lands?\e"
M05290005,"\h(《Isapa》)Our king is still single and he is looking for
an elegant young lady… Fina, perhaps you would
consider joining the royal family?\e"
M05290006,"\h(《Fina》)What?!
I… I'm sorry, but I…\e"
M05290007,"\h(《Aika》)H, hey!
Who ever said Fina was interested in becoming 
queen?!\e"
M05290008,\h(《Aika》)And why just her?! What am I?! Huskra food?\e
M05290009,"\h(《Isapa》)Gahahaha! I'm very sorry…
If you were to marry the king, you'd probably
take over as king and order HIM around!!\e"
M05290010,\h(《Aika》)What?! Why does everyone think that way of me?!\e
M05290011,"\h(《Isapa》)Come back any time you wish, ladies! We'll 
always be more than happy to give you a warm 
welcome! Gahahahaha!!!\e"
M05290012,"\h(《Isapa》)There was a great disturbance in the wind. I 
felt a strong power emerge in the east…\e"
M05290013,"\h(《Isapa》)Lord Vyse… I pray to Quetya that he watches
over you and your companions…\e"
Ms235a000,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms235a001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
