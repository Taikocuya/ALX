MI0040000,\h(《Vyse》)This looks like it's the last door.\e
MI0040001,"\h(《Aika》)The fog is so thick… I can barely see what's in
front of me…\e"
MI0040002,\h(《Fina》)It's so cold… even the air is freezing…\e
MI0040003,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we can't let that stop us.\e"
MI0040004,\h(《Vyse》)Aaaahhh!!!\e
MI0040005,\h(《Fina》)…Vyse?\e
MI0040006,"\h(《Aika》)… Hey!
Where'd Vyse go?\e"
MI0040007,\h(《Vyse》)… I'm down here…\e
MI0040008,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse?!
What happened?!\e"
MI0040009,\h(《Vyse》)That was close… \e
MI0040010,"\h(《Vyse》)If we can see the sky through the floor… that
means we're at the bottom!\e"
MI0040011,\h(《Fina》)Hey… the fog is starting to lift.\e
MI0040012,\h(《Enrique》)Oh… I never imagined that we'd find this…\e
MI0040013,"\h(《Aika》)Wow…

from the ceiling!\e"
MI0040014,"\h(《Fina》)…This is Glacia. In the Old World,
it was the capital of this region.\e"
MI0040015,"\h(《Fina》)The people that lived here were powerful mages…
Using the powers of the Purple Moon, they built
this city.\e"
MI0040016,"\h(《Fina》)And because this city was built below the ice,
it was unharmed by the Rains of Destruction.\e"
MI0040017,"\h(《Fina》)So, Glacia is as it was during the time of the
Old World.\e"
MI0040018,"\h(《Aika》)But wait…
Then what happened to the people that were
living here?\e"
MI0040019,"\h(《Fina》)… I, I don't know.
According to the legends, the people of Glacia
just disappeared.\e"
MI0040020,"\h(《Fina》)Nobody knows where they went, or why they left.\e"
MI0040021,"\h(《Fina》)Maybe they left their city to invade another
land… \e"
MI0040022,\h(《Fina》)And they perished in the war and in the Rains…\e
MI0040023,"\h(《Aika》)I can't imagine an entire culture becoming
extinct.\e"
MI0040024,"\h(《Aika》)Think of all of the knowledge that was lost… 
Everything that these people worked so hard for
is going to stay buried here forever.\e"
MI0040025,"\h(《Vyse》)…Let's go.
We should find the Purple Moon Crystal, 
before we get buried here forever.\e"

I can't tell what…\c"
