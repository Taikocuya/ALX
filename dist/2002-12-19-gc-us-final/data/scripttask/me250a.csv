MQ0080002,"\h(《Vyse》)You're the one that put out that Black Spot and
called me out here?\e"
MQ0080003,"\h(《Young Female Voice》)Yes, you are correct. You've been quite the
popular Air Pirate around these parts lately,
you know.\e"
MQ0080004,"\h(《Young Female Voice》)However, I cannot sit idly while Air Pirates fly
the skies freely and do as they please!\e"
MQ0080005,"\h(《Young Female Air Pirate》)My name is Piastol. I am a bounty hunter... And
I specialize in finishing off Air Pirates!\e"
MQ0080006,"\h(《Piastol》)I am feared amongst even the most hardened Air
Pirates. They have dubbed me... the Angel of
Death!\e"
MQ0080007,"\h(《Piastol》)And the Angel has come for you, Vyse!\e"
MQ0080008,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow... imagine that! We've actually become
famous enough to have real bounty hunters come
after us.\e"
MQ0080009,"\h(《Aika》)Oh grow up, Vyse! It's not a good thing when
bounty hunters start coming after you!
Especially ones called “The Angel of Death”!!!\e"
MQ0080010,"\h(《Piastol》)You seem... confident. Perhaps you truly are as
strong as they say. I suppose this is why you've
been able to stand toe to toe with Valua.\e"
MQ0080011,"\h(《Piastol》)However, you are still just an Air Pirate! I'll
send you and your mangy crew to the bottom of
the clouds!\c"
MQ0090000,"\h(《Piastol》)How... how could this be?! How could I lose to a
lowly Air Pirate?!\e"
MQ0090001,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm sorry, but I'm a tad too young to die just
yet. Come back in... maybe 50 or 60 years? I
might be ready to keel over by then.\e"
MQ0090002,"\h(《Vyse》)But, in the meantime, we're gonna continue
sailing. I think it's time for you to get back
to your own ship.\e"
MQ0090003,\h(《Piastol》)Grr...\e
MQ0090004,\h(《Piastol》)...!\e
MQ0090005,"\h(《Piastol》)That scar... the one on your cheek!
And your goggles!!!\e"
MQ0090006,\h(《Vyse》)...Huh? What're you mumbling about now?\e
MQ0090007,"\h(《Piastol》)It... it can't be! No... I'd recognize you
anywhere! It is you!!!\e"
MQ0090008,"\h(《Piastol》)As I have told you, I am known across the skies
as the Angel of Death.\e"
MQ0090009,"\h(《Piastol》)I swear upon that cursed name that I will hunt
you down and finish you off!\e"
MQ0090010,"\h(《Piastol》)I will find you again... and your deaths I shall
bring!!\e"
MQ0090011,"\h(《Piastol》)Until then, I will let you live. However, the
next time we meet, it will be the end of you!\e"
MQ0090012,"\h(《Aika》)What's her problem?! She just says whatever she
wants and takes off like that! I'd like to give
her a piece of my mind!!\e"
MQ0090013,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't waste your energy. She'll be back.
In the meantime, we've got an adventure to
get back to.\c"
MQ0100000,"\h(《Piastol》)I've been waiting for you, Vyse.
I assume that you remember me?\e"
MQ0100001,"\h(《Piastol》)I am Piastol...
I am the hunter of Air Pirates. I am…
the Angel of Death!\e"
MQ0100002,"\h(《Piastol》)I have come to deliver death unto you.
This very place shall become your grave.\e"
MQ0100003,"\h(《Aika》)You call us out here and then you start spouting
all this nonsense? You have problems, lady.\e"
MQ0100004,"\h(《Aika》)And so we beat you once... Who cares?! Just give
it a rest already, will ya? Why are you being so
persistent?!\e"
MQ0100005,"\h(《Piastol》)...You speak as if my search for you has been a
recent phenomenon, oh red-headed one.\e"
MQ0100006,"\h(《Piastol》)These past 7 years... I have been searching the
world for you. Looking for any trace of your
passing I could find... Vyse.\e"
MQ0100007,\h(《Vyse》)Huh? What're you talking about?\e
MQ0100008,\h(《Piastol》)...I have no other words for you!\e
MQ0100009,"\h(《Piastol》)Today I will have my revenge! En garde, Vyse!\e"
MQ0110000,"\h(《Piastol》)Wh, why?! Why is it that I finally fight the man
I have been searching for all these years and
yet... I cannot win??\e"
MQ0110001,"\h(《Vyse》)H, hey... Okay, seriously... what're you talking
about?\e"
MQ0110002,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah! What exactly were you talking about when
you said that you've been chasing us for 7
years?? That's a really long time, you know!\e"
MQ0110003,"\h(《Piastol》)S, silence!
You could never understand my pain!\e"
MQ0110004,"\h(《Piastol》)Remember this, Vyse!
I swear that someday, I will defeat you!\e"
MQ0110005,"\h(《Piastol》)Don't think you can escape your fate!
I shall never forgive you!\e"
MQ0120000,"\h(《Piastol》)Vyse, today is the day that I take your life.\e"
MQ0120001,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, now you just wait a second there. You mind
telling us exactly why you hate Vyse so much??\e"
MQ0120002,"\h(《Piastol》)I despise all Air Pirates. That is why I became
a hunter of you despicable people.\e"
MQ0120003,"\h(《Piastol》)It all started 7 years ago... when my family was
brutally murdered by Air Pirates.\e"
MQ0120004,"\h(《Piastol》)And that is where I saw you, Vyse, among the Air
Pirate scum that took my family from me.\e"
MQ0120005,"\h(《Vyse》)H, huh?!\e"
MQ0120006,\h(《Aika》)You've gotta be mistaken!!\e
MQ0120007,"\h(《Aika》)We're Blue Rogues!
We'd never do something like that!\e"
MQ0120008,"\h(《Piastol》)Silence! Blue, Black... you're all the same!
You all deserve to die!\e"
MQ0120009,"\h(《Piastol》)My only purpose in life since then has been to
deliver justice unto the Air Pirates that
destroyed my life.\e"
MQ0120010,"\h(《Piastol》)Vyse, it is time for me to have my revenge!
Have at you!\e"
MQ0130000,"\h(《Piastol》)F... Father... am I doomed... to never win?
To... never avenge your death?\e"
MQ0130001,"\h(《Vyse》)Piastol, tell me. Tell me what happened to you
7 years ago.\e"
MQ0130002,"\h(《Vyse》)I want to know. I need to know why you think I
killed your family.\e"
MQ0130003,\h(《Piastol》)......\e
MQ0130004,"\h(《Piastol》)...Very well. Perhaps it will help jog your
memory, as well.\e"
MQ0130005,\h(《Piastol》)7 years ago... I was a young girl of 10 years.\e
MQ0130006,"\h(《Piastol》)My father was a soldier in the Valua Armada.
My entire family lived aboard his ship as we
sailed the Valuan skies... together.\e"
MQ0130007,"\h(《Piastol》)One night, I was awakened by a loud explosion
and rumbling.\e"
MQ0130008,"\h(《Piastol》)I rushed to the deck, and found nothing but a
sea of flames.\e"
MQ0130009,"\h(《Piastol》)But, I could see through the flames that an Air
Pirate ship was fast approaching.\e"
MQ0130010,"\h(《Piastol》)The rest of my family was on the bridge of our
ship... but the flames were too strong. I
couldn't get through to them.\e"
MQ0130011,"\h(《Piastol》)My father used to always tell me that in
situations like this, to “save myself first.”\e"
MQ0130012,"\h(《Piastol》)I was so worried about my father... and my baby
sister... but instead, I rushed to the room
where we kept the life boats.\e"
MQ0130013,"\h(《Piastol》)That is where I ran into an Air Pirate... A red-
haired Air Pirate girl!\e"
MQ0130014,"\h(《Aika》)...!
Wait a second... that was you?!\e"
MQ0130015,"\h(《Piastol》)Yes, it was I. And for whatever reason, even
though you were invading our ship, I found you
unarmed.\e"
MQ0130016,"\h(《Piastol》)I reacted, as the soldier my father had raised
me to be. Without a second thought, I drew my
knife... I threw it with the intention to kill.\e"
MQ0130017,"\h(《Piastol》)But, my knife missed its mark. It's because
you, Vyse, jumped in the way to protect her.\e"
MQ0130018,"\h(《Piastol》)And my knife struck your cheek. Yes, that scar
on your cheek is from the knife that I threw.\e"
MQ0130019,"\h(《Piastol》)And while you were both still disoriented, I
made away on a lifeboat and left you to burn on
the ship that you destroyed.\e"
MQ0130020,"\h(《Piastol》)I later learned that the flagship “Aquila” did
not sink...\e"
MQ0130021,"\h(《Piastol》)And that they... found my father's corpse. The
doctors say that it was not the fire that had
killed him... but a sword wound.\e"
MQ0130022,"\h(《Piastol》)I also heard that my sister was alive,
but I have no idea where she is now.\e"
MQ0130023,"\h(《Piastol》)That is when I swore that I would have vengeance
on the Air Pirates that destroyed my life.\e"
MQ0130024,\h(《Piastol》)That is when I became a hunter of Air Pirates.\e
MQ0130025,"\h(《Piastol》)Now do you understand, Vyse?
Now do you understand why I hate you so?\e"
MQ0130026,"\h(《Aika》)...Piastol, I hate to tell you this,
but you've got a few things mixed up.\e"
MQ0130027,\h(《Aika》)We weren't the ones that attacked you.\e
MQ0130028,"\h(《Aika》)We just happened to be in the area when we saw
that your ship was in trouble. We boarded your
ship to try and help.\e"
MQ0130029,"\h(《Piastol》)How dare you?!
You think your lies will fool me?!\e"
MQ0130030,"\h(《Aika》)I remember that incident, too.
I remember everything that happened...\e"
MQ0130031,"\h(《Aika》)When we were getting prepared, I just figured
it was a rescue mission... I was careless and
didn't think I would need my weapons.\e"
MQ0130032,"\h(《Aika》)And... because of me... because of my
stupidity... Vyse got hurt. All because of my
carelessness.\e"
MQ0130033,\h(《Vyse》)Aika...\e
MQ0130034,"\h(《Aika》)...Piastol. You've gotta believe me. We weren't
the ones who attacked your ship.\e"
MQ0130035,"\h(《Aika》)I would never lie about that day. Not after what
happened to Vyse. I... I wouldn't be able to
forgive myself if I did.\e"
MQ0130036,\h(《Piastol》)......\e
MQ0130037,\h(《Piastol》)Is that all you have to say?\e
MQ0130038,\h(《Aika》)Piastol...\e
MQ0130039,"\h(《Piastol》)...Vyse.
I will come for you one last time.\e"
MQ0130040,"\h(《Piastol》)And then, I will put everything on the line.
I will put an end to this cat and mouse game.\e"
MQ0130041,"\h(《Vyse》)...Understood. Just call me at the
Sailors' Guild, like always.\e"
MQ0140000,\h(《Piastol》)Vyse... This will be our final battle!\e
MQ0140001,"\h(《Aika》)Piastol! Wait a second!!
There's something we need to tell you!!\e"
MQ0140002,"\h(《Piastol》)Nothing can save you now. The only thing I
desire is to watch Vyse fall by my hand. That is
all I live for.\e"
MQ0140003,"\h(《Piastol》)I will defeat you. The last 7 years of my life
rests on the outcome of this very battle!\e"
MQ0150000,\h(《Piastol》)......\e
MQ0150001,\h(《Vyse》)Piastol...\e
MQ0150002,"\h(《Piastol》)...I knew I would lose. Having fought you three
times already, I knew that I was no match for
you. Only a fool would think otherwise.\e"
MQ0150003,\h(《Piastol》)And... I know that you weren't lying.\e
MQ0150004,\h(《Aika》)Then... then why?! Why'd you still fight?!\e
MQ0150005,"\h(《Piastol》)If it wasn't you Air Pirates that took my
father's life, then what have the last 7 years
of my life been for??\e"
MQ0150006,"\h(《Piastol》)For what reason have I fought... alone... All
these long years?\e"
MQ0150007,"\h(《Piastol》)I lost my reason for living. No... it was wrong
for me to only live for revenge in the first
place.\e"
MQ0150008,"\h(《Piastol》)That is why I thought that I deserved to die by
your hand... To cleanse myself of this lie that
I have lived.\e"
MQ0150009,\h(《Aika》)Piastol...\e
MQ0150010,"\h(《Vyse》)...Piastol. Near Sailors' Island, there is a
small doctor's ship.\e"
MQ0150011,"\h(《Vyse》)Go find it. Doc, and your sister, Maria, are
aboard that ship.\e"
MQ0150012,"\h(《Piastol》)W, what?! If you're lying to me, I shall make
you pay with your life!\e"
MQ0150013,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey now, didn't you just say that you believed
us? You better do something about that temper
of yours...\e"
MQ0150014,\h(《Piastol》)Vyse... Is it really true? Can I trust you?\e
MQ0150015,"\h(《Piastol》)But... no! I can't see them! Not like this. Not
as the Angel of Death. I can't let them know
what has become of me.\e"
MQ0150016,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, come on! Relax, Piastol!
Just go see them already!\e"
MQ0150017,"\h(《Fina》)I'm sure that Doc and Maria would be more than
happy to see you, too.\e"
MQ0150018,"\h(《Vyse》)Now get going! We don't have time to sit here
and smell the roses! We've got sailing to do!\e"
MQ0150019,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, I almost forgot.
I wanted to tell you one thing.\e"
MQ0150020,"\h(《Vyse》)Piastol...
You're not the Angel of Death.
You never were.\e"
MQ0150021,"\h(《Vyse》)You've always been Maria's older sister. Just
ask her... I'm sure she'll tell you the same.\e"
MQ0150022,\h(《Piastol》)Vyse... I... I don't know what to say...\e
MQ0150023,"\h(《Vyse》)Maybe we'll see you again somewhere out in this
big blue sky! Until then, Piastol!\c"
MQ0180000,"\h(《Tara》)What is this thing?
I've never seen a ship like this before!\e"
MQ0180001,\h(《Lira》)I wonder if there are men aboard this ship...\e
MQ0180002,"\h(《Pera》)Shall we attack this ship as usual?
I'm sure someone will come out then.\e"
MQ0180003,"\h(《Vyse》)What's all the noise?!
Hey! Who are you??\e"
MQ0180004,\h(《Tara》)Hey!\e
MQ0180005,\h(《Lira》)Wow!\e
MQ0180006,\h(《Pera》)Oh my!\e
MQ0180007,\h(《Tara》)He's actually kinda cute!\e
MQ0180008,\h(《Lira》)We haven't caught one this cute in a while!\e
MQ0180009,\h(《Pera》)Maybe today's our lucky day!\e
MQ0180010,"\h(《Lira》)But what's with that eye patch thing? He's got
no fashion sense.\e"
MQ0180011,"\h(《Tara》)What're you talking about! I think it gives
him some flair!\e"
MQ0180012,"\h(《Pera》)Wow, Tara, you really have bad taste!\e"
MQ0180013,\h(《Tara》)Fine then. I'll just keep him all to myself!\e
MQ0180014,"\h(《Lira》)Hey, that's not fair!\e"
MQ0180015,"\h(《Pera》)Hey, that's not fair!\e"
MQ0180016,"\h(《Vyse》)Wh, who are these girls?!\e"
MQ0180017,"\h(《Aika》)I know! They've gotta be those girls that I read
about at the Sailors' Guild! You know, the
“Ixa'ness Demons”!!!\e"
MQ0180018,"\h(《Aika》)But who'da thought that the Ixa'ness Demons
would be three little girls?? Kinda
anticlimactic if you ask me.\e"
MQ0180019,"\h(《Tara》)Hey, who are these two ugly girls?
They're starting to get on my nerves.\e"
MQ0180020,"\h(《Lira》)They're probably just jealous because we're
so much younger and prettier.\e"
MQ0180021,\h(《Pera》)That's why I hate old hags like them.\e
MQ0180022,"\h(《Aika》)These three are really getting on my nerves!
And why would we be jealous of you little twerps
in the first place??\e"
MQ0180023,"\h(《Aika》)And Fina! Don't just stand there! Say something!
They're insulting us!!!\e"
MQ0180024,"\h(《Fina》)...
Aika? What's an old hag?\e"
MQ0180025,\h(《Aika》)Go figure.\e
MQ0180026,"\h(《Tara》)Well then, everyone... I hope you're ready!\e"
MQ0180027,\h(《Lira》)Of course!\e
MQ0180028,\h(《Pera》)I'm always ready!\e
MQ0180029,"\h(《Tara》)Well, Mr. Handsome, you best prepare yourself!
Because if we beat you, you'll have to marry one
of us!!!\e"
MQ0190000,"\h(《Tara》)H, how could this be??\e"
MQ0190001,\h(《Lira》)We're the Ixa'ness' most powerful warriors!!\e
MQ0190002,\h(《Pera》)I can't believe we lost!!\e
MQ0190003,"\h(《Aika》)Now that that's settled, you guys have to
promise not to cause any more trouble.\e"
MQ0190004,\h(《Tara》)Hmph!\e
MQ0190005,\h(《Lira》)Hmph!\e
MQ0190006,\h(《Pera》)Hmph!\e
MQ0190007,"\h(《Tara》)...Defeat is defeat. You won fair and square, so
we promise that we'll behave.\e"
MQ0190008,"\h(《Lira》)But, finding a good and strong man to marry is
one of the traditions of the Ixa'ness warriors!\e"
MQ0190009,"\h(《Pera》)One day, we all hope to find a man like you!\e"
MQ0190010,"\h(《Vyse》)Like me? Well, uh, best of luck to ya.\e"
MQ0190011,"\h(《Tara》)Next time you come through this area, you best
be careful! We just might come after you again!\e"
MQ0190012,"\h(《Lira》)As for you, old hags, you best be careful, too.\e"
MQ0190013,"\h(《Pera》)If you don't keep an eye on your man, we just
might snatch him away from you both!\e"
MQ0190014,"\h(《Aika》)H, hey! Just get out of here already, will ya?!
I'm getting tired of hearing your jabbering!\e"
MQ0190015,"\h(《Tara》)Farewell, Mr. Handsome!
Don't be afraid to come back and play!\e"
MQ0260000,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright, everyone! We're home! Get some rest
while we have the chance!\e"
MQ0260001,"\h(《Aika》)It really is nice to come home once in a while.
Finally, I can have some time to unwind!\e"
MQ0260002,"\h(《A Vaguely Familiar Voice》)Heeeey, baby!
How've ya been, Red? Ya miss me??\e"
MQ0260003,"\h(《Fina》)Oh! It sounds like there's someone out on the
deck. Aika, is it a friend of yours?\e"
MQ0260004,"\h(《Aika》)That crude voice... That musky smell...
Could it be...?\e"
MQ0260005,"\h(《A Really Familiar Voice》)Heh heh, I'm touched, baby! You remembered me!
I'm back for ya! And this time, I'm not takin'
“no” as an answer!\e"
MQ0260006,"\h(《Vigoro》)Vyse! Show yourself! Air Pirate Vigoro is here
to greet you!\e"
MQ0260007,"\h(《Aika》)I knew it... That would explain why I've been
feeling nauseous all day.\e"
MQ0260008,"\h(《Vyse》)Vigoro...
You're alive!!\e"
MQ0260009,"\h(《Vigoro》)As much as ever.
Since the last time we met, I've become an Air
Pirate, as you can see.\e"
MQ0260010,"\h(《Vigoro》)And I've searched the world for the strongest
sailors I could find, and picked fights with
all of them.\e"
MQ0260011,"\h(《Vigoro》)Fight after fight, I emerged victorious! And
I am stronger than ever! With this strength, you
won't stand a chance against me!\e"
MQ0260012,"\h(《Vyse》)W, wait a second there, Vigoro...
Are you saying that you want to fight? Again?!\e"
MQ0260013,"\h(《Vigoro》)Of course! And I even did everything the proper
Air Pirate way! I boarded your ship, and now
I'm challenging you to a fight!\e"
MQ0260014,"\h(《Vigoro》)Come on, Vyse! Once I defeat you, I will become
the king of all Air Pirates!\c"
MQ0270000,\h(《Vigoro》)Heh... You truly are... strong.\e
MQ0270001,"\h(《Vigoro》)Even after all that traning, I still can't beat
you ...\e"
MQ0270002,\h(《Vyse》)Vigoro...\e
MQ0270003,"\h(《Vigoro》)But, by fighting with you, I discovered
something, and I've decided to make it my new
motto.\e"
MQ0270004,"\h(《Vigoro》)I decided to adopt your policy of “no matter
what happens, never give up.”\e"
MQ0270005,"\h(《Vigoro》)I'm not giving up on defeating you. I'm going to
become stronger, and next time we meet, I will
surely beat you!\e"
MQ0270006,"\h(《Vyse》)...Understood.
Whenever you're ready, come find me.\e"
MQ0270007,"\h(《Aika》)I swear, he sure is persistent.\e"
MQ0270008,"\h(《Vigoro》)With that, I must go. My dear lovely crew
members await me aboard the Draco.\e"
MQ0270009,"\h(《Vigoro》)Someday, I'll have my own headquarters like
this! And I'll fill it up with the most
beautiful women from around the world!\e"
MQ0270010,"\h(《Vigoro》)So long, Vyse! You better take care of those two
pretty ladies until next time we meet!
Especially Red!\c"
MQ0220000,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Ho ho! So this is the ship of the
infamous Vyse, eh?\e"
MQ0220001,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Not bad, not bad!! Of course, I would have it
painted in gold and purple. Gold makes
everything look better.\e"
MQ0220002,"\h(《Vyse》)Someone sounded the alarm? Is someone raiding
our ship or something??\e"
MQ0220003,\h(《Aika》)Vyse! Over there!\e
MQ0220004,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Vyse, I presume? My name is Daikokuya. Very nice
to finally meet your acquintance.\e"
MQ0220005,"\h(《Aika》)What?! You mean to tell me that you're the same
Daikokuya that's got a bounty on his head?!\e"
MQ0220006,"\h(《Daikokuya》)As the wealthiest man in Yafutoma, I lived a
life of luxury. I had no want of material
possessions. And yet, I felt... unsatisfied.\e"
MQ0220007,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Then I heard about your adventures in Yafutoma.
I realized then that the life of an Air Pirate
was the life that I had been craving!\e"
MQ0220008,"\h(《Daikokuya》)So, I bought a ship, got together a crew, and
built this machine, “Tama,” for my personal
use.\e"
MQ0220009,"\h(《Daikokuya》)I wanted to travel the skies in search of fun
and excitement, just like you, Vyse!\e"
MQ0220010,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it's not all fun and games, you know...\e"
MQ0220011,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Nevertheless, I believe that it was fate that
we have met this day.\e"
MQ0220012,"\h(《Daikokuya》)I think your head would make a fine trophy for
me to take home.\e"
MQ0220013,"\h(《Vyse》)Sounds good. Only problem is you'll have to beat
me first!\e"
MQ0220014,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Heh heh... Fool! There is nothing in this world
that money can't buy!\e"
MQ0220015,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Very well, en garde, Vyse!
I shall make you remember this day!\e"
MQ0230000,"\h(《Daikokuya》)I give up! You win!
I wouldn't have expected any less of you!
I think I'm smitten with you!\e"
MQ0230001,"\h(《Daikokuya》)That power... That strength!
I guess there really are things in this world
that money can't buy!\e"
MQ0230002,"\h(《Aika》)You've learned quite an important lesson!
So, why don't you just stop wasting your money
and quietly go home?\e"
MQ0230003,\h(《Daikokuya》)You are speaking to the one and only Daikokuya!\e
MQ0230004,"\h(《Daikokuya》)While I promise to cause no more trouble, I will
not discontinue my travels around the world!\e"
MQ0230005,"\h(《Vyse》)Hahaha, you're an energetic old guy, aren't ya?\e"
MQ0230006,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Well well, if it isn't Vyse.
We managed to get ourselves lost in this frigid
place.\e"
MQ0230007,"\h(《Daikokuya》)I'm frozen stiff. I was hoping that you would
warm me up, Vyse...\e"
MQ0230008,"\h(《Vyse》)W, warm you up?! Uh... you're joking, right??\e"
MQ0230009,"\h(《Daikokuya》)Only partly, but I know your love belongs to
someone else. I guess this means I've found yet
another thing that money cannot buy.\e"
MQ0230010,"\h(《Aika》)Ahahaha! Well, Vyse, you sure are popular these
days!\e"
MQ0230011,"\h(《Vyse》)All hands on deck! Prepare for emergency
escape!\e"
MQ0160000,"\h(《Large Man》)Hmm, you have the look of a sailor about you.
Today is your lucky day. We're feeling generous,
so leave all your money and we'll let you live.\e"
MQ0160001,"\h(《Large Man》)Do not attempt to resist! We are the legendary
Air Pirates of the Larso Clan!\e"
MQ0160002,"\h(《Vyse》)So... You're Rupee Larso, eh? Good timing.
We were just looking for you.\e"
MQ0160003,"\h(《Vyse》)You've made quite a name for yourself, robbing
innocent sailors and all. As Blue Rogues, we
cannot sit idly and let you continue like this!\e"
MQ0160004,"\h(《Large Man》)You're quite brave for such a small boy. Very
well, then... Shall we battle here and get it
over with?\e"
MQ0160005,"\h(《Vyse》)No, wait. There's no need to cause needless
destruction in the city. Meet me at my ship.
We can fight on the deck.\e"
MQ0160006,"\h(《Large Man》)Out in the open, eh? Very well. Lead the way.\e"
MQ0160007,"\h(《Vyse》)I am Vyse of the Blue Rogues. Rupee Larso…
Prepare to defend yourself!\e"
MQ0160008,"\h(《Large Man》)Hahaha... You truly are a brave little boy.
However, you are mistaken about one thing.
I am not Rupee Larso.\e"
MQ0160009,"\h(《Large Man》)Master Rupee!
It is time to do battle!
Please come out here!\e"
MQ0160010,"\h(《Rupee》)Barta...
You know how I hate fighting...\e"
MQ0160011,"\h(《Barta》)Master Rupee! You are the head of the Larso
Clan! You should not say things like that!
There are enemies present!\e"
MQ0160012,"\h(《Barta》)Now that your father has passed away,
you are our leader! You must be strong!\e"
MQ0160013,"\h(《Aika》)This little runt is their leader? I'd heard
that the leader of the Larso Clan was a giant! I
guess I shouldn't believe everything I hear...\e"
MQ0160014,"\h(《Barta》)What did you say?!?! How dare you speak of
Master Rupee like that!
You shall pay for your insolence!!\e"
MQ0160015,"\h(《Barta》)I shall crush your skulls like so many
Loquat Berries!!\e"
MQ0160016,"\h(《Rupee》)Like Loquat Berries?!
Barta, do you always have to be so graphic??
It makes me sick to my stomach...\e"
MQ0160017,"\h(《Barta》)M, master Rupee! I was just trying to put fear
into them! Be strong!!
We are about to do battle!\e"
MQ0160018,"\h(《Barta》)Now, put your back into it! We must show them
the true power of the Larso Clan!!\e"
MQ0200000,"\h(《Lapen》)What're you lookin' at, punk?!\e"
MQ0200001,"\h(《Aika》)Heh... Looks like we've got a live one here.
At least this makes the bounty more interesting.
\e"
MQ0200002,"\h(《Vyse》)I hear that you've been thrashing up cities with
that machine of yours. Your name's Lapen, right?
\e"
MQ0200003,"\h(《Lapen》)Heh, what of it? And what... you here to try
and stop me or somethin'?\e"
MQ0200004,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, that's the plan. The name's Vyse.
Vyse of the Blue Rogues. We're here to earn a
little cash.\e"
MQ0200005,"\h(《Lapen》)So... You're this “Vyse” that everyone keeps
talking about. You're makin' quite a name for
yourself.\e"
MQ0200006,"\h(《Lapen》)This day's turning out to be quite interesting.
If I can defeat you, that means that I'll become
even more famous than you!\e"
MQ0200007,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's fight outside of the city. I don't want
anyone not involved to get hurt. Come to my
ship and we'll fight there.\e"
MQ0200008,"\h(《Lapen》)Heh... Coward. But if fighting outside makes
you feel comfortable, whatever. You'll need all
the help you can get to beat me.\e"
MQ0200009,\h(《Vyse》)I hear that you built that machine yourself.\e
MQ0200010,"\h(《Lapen》)Damn right I did. It's the only thing my good-
for-nothing pops ever taught me.\e"
MQ0200011,"\h(《Aika》)Dad? You have a dad? I figured you must've just
hatched from an egg and crawled out from under
some rock somewhere.\e"
MQ0200012,"\h(《Lapen》)Watch your mouth! Besides, he's not even my real
pops. He just found me somewhere and decided to
raise me.\e"
MQ0200013,"\h(《Lapen》)I didn't ask for help. He just picked me up and
brought me home. Anyway, his name is Centime...
The coward.\e"
MQ0200014,\h(《Vyse》)Wait a minute... Centime is your dad???\e
MQ0200015,"\h(《Aika》)Hah! I doubt it. I don't see how Centime could
have raised a slime ball like this!\e"
MQ0200016,"\h(《Lapen》)I said watch your mouth, wench! You don't know
a single thing about what you're talking about!\e"
MQ0200017,"\h(《Lapen》)Me and Gunarm are gonna be big! Real big!
Not like that old fart of a dad!\e"
MQ0200018,"\h(《Lapen》)Vyse, I'm gonna rip you apart with this machine!
You best come at me with all you got because
I'm not holdin' back!\e"
MI0010000,\h(《Fina》)Vyse! Crescent Isle is straight ahead!\e
MI0010001,"\h(《Vyse》)Yup, that's Crescent Isle all right. 
But it looks… different.\e"
MI0010002,"\h(《Enrique》)If we reached Crescent Isle by flying east from 
Yafutoma, that means…\e"
MI0010003,\h(《Aika》)We sailed around the world!!!\e
MI0010004,"\h(《Aika》)Hey Vyse! How does it feel to have sailed around
the world with your very own ship?\e"
MI0010005,"\h(《What will you say?》)“I want to see more.”
“I thought it would take longer.”\e"
MI0010006,"\h(《Vyse》)I want to see more! I don't think I'll be happy
until I see the whole world!\e"
MI0010007,\h(《Vyse》)I know there's more out there.\e
MI0010008,"\h(《Fina》)Haha… to think that we just made it home and
Vyse is already talking about sailing some
more… How typical of him.\e"
MI0010009,"\h(《Vyse》)I thought it would take longer! I guess I always
imagined the world being larger than it actually
is.\e"
MI0010010,"\h(《Fina》)That's probably because we sailed in a straight
line across the world.\e"
MI0010011,"\h(《Fina》)To make Vyse happy, we're probably going to have
to visit every single continent.\e"
MI0010012,\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… You're probably right.\e
MI0010013,"\h(《Aika》)I don't think Vyse will ever be satisfied with
what he's accomplished.\e"
MI0010014,"\h(《Fina》)Hahaha…
I agree.\e"
MI0010015,"\h(《Fina》)It looks like there are some new buildings that
weren't there before.\e"
MI0010016,"\h(《Aika》)Izmael probably built them while we were gone
with the money we gave him!\e"
MI0010017,"\h(《Aika》)I wonder what Crescent Isle looks like now!
Hurry up and land, Vyse!\e"
MI0010018,\h(《Vyse》)Alright! I can't wait to check it out!\e
MJ0090000,"\h(《Vyse》)Brabham, could you take a look at these?
These are plans for a ship we found at Dangral…\e"
MJ0090001,\h(《Brabham》)Plans? Plans? I love lookin' at plans!\e
MJ0090002,"\h(《Brabham》)What's this?
These are plans to enable a ship to enter Deep
Sky!\e"
MJ0090003,\h(《Vyse》)Can you use these plans to modify the Delphinus?\e
MJ0090004,"\h(《Brabham》)Darn tootin'! 
But it'll take me some time!\e"
MJ0090005,"\h(《Brabham》)Heh, I can't wait to get started!!! 
I can have it done in 10 days!\e"
MJ0090006,\h(《Vyse》)Good… If anyone can do it… it's you.\e
MJ0090007,\h(　)You gave the “Ship Schematics” to Brabham.\e
MJ0220000,"\h(《Vyse》)Modifications to the Delphinus began on that
day.\e"
MJ0220001,"\h(《Vyse》)We needed 10 days to finish our preparations.
Crescent Isle began to bustle with activity…\e"
MJ0220002,"\h(《Vyse》)Using the blueprints that we took from Valua,
Brabham was hard at work rebuilding the engine
of the Delphinus.\e"
MJ0220003,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't wait to see what lies in Deep Sky
with my own eyes…\e"
MJ0220004,"\h(《Vyse》)Far beneath the great, blue sky… beneath the
clouds… I can already imagine that the
atmospheric pressure must be high…\e"
MJ0220005,"\h(《Vyse》)We must reinforce the Delphinus' hull to make
sure that it doesn't collapse under the
pressure…\e"
MK0120000,\h(《Vyse》)Where are we?\e
MK0120001,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, I don't like this. 
Are you okay?\e"
MK0120002,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, I think so… 
How about you?\e"
MK0120003,"\h(《Aika》)I'm not sure yet…
I feel… strange…\e"
MK0120004,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, Fina…
Where'd the crazy old man go?\e"
MK0120005,"\h(《Fina》)I don't know…
I'm not sure what's going on.
I've never been here before.\e"
MK0120006,"\h(《Elder Prime》)You are in the Hall of Knowledge.
This is where you will find the Chronicles of
Arcadia.\e"
MK0120007,"\h(《Elder Prime》)It is here, where you may observe the events
that shaped the world as you know it.\e"
MK0120008,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Look not with your eyes, but with your hearts.
You will see the power of the Moon Crystals and
witness the Rains of Destruction.\e"
MK0120009,\h(《Vyse》)It looks like a giant island!\e
MK0120010,"\h(《Elder Prime》)This is Soltis.
Long ago, this continent flourished under
the light of the Silver Moon.\e"
MK0120011,\h(《Elder Prime》)It was our home.\e
MK0120012,"\h(《Aika》)So, there was one continent 
for each moon, right?\e"
MK0120013,"\h(《Elder Prime》)You are correct.
The world was at peace, and its population was 
thirsting for knowledge.\e"
MK0120014,"\h(《Elder Prime》)But their leaders used their newfound knowledge 
to create the Gigas. I believe you have 
seen what the Gigas can do first-hand.\e"
MK0120015,"\h(《Elder Prime》)They all sought the power of the Moon Crystals. 
These six little gems twisted the hearts and
souls of men.\e"
MK0120016,"\h(《Elder Prime》)The world became a nightmare. 
One-thousand atrocities resulted in countless
deaths.\e"
MK0120017,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Even after most of the world was destroyed,
the survivors sought to kill rather than heal.\e"
MK0120018,"\h(《Elder Prime》)We watched and judged.
We decided that the world could not be saved. \e"
MK0120019,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Everything came from nothing, so to complete the
cycle, we decided to destroy everything, so the 
world would once again, be nothing.\e"
MK0120020,"\h(《Elder Prime》)We believed that a new, peaceful world would
rise from the ashes of the old.\e"
MK0120021,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Zelos, our own Gigas was born.\e"
MK0120022,"\h(《Elder Prime》)It was a Gigas born from nothing, but it
encompassed everything. It was truly almighty.\e"
MK0120023,"\h(《Elder Prime》)We then commanded Zelos to focus 
it's energy on the Moons.\e"
MK0120024,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Moon Stones battered the lands…
The world was cleansed of evil.\e"
MK0120025,\h(《Elder Prime》)Zelos was the cause of the Rains of Destruction.\e
MK0120026,"\h(《Elder Prime》)…When it was over, we placed Zelos in a state
of suspended animation, and sealed him in the 
depths of Soltis with our magic.\e"
MK0120027,"\h(《Elder Prime》)It was a magical seal so great, that only the
power of the six Moon Crystals together could
break it.\e"
MK0120028,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Afterwards, we sent Soltis, along with Zelos, 
into Deep Sky, where we hoped, 
it would remain lost forever.\e"
MK0120029,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Zelos was too powerful…
Never should a living soul animate him.\e"
MK0120030,"\h(《Elder Prime》)We separated this shrine from the rest of Soltis
and fled to the skies.\e"
MK0120031,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Since the days of the Old World, we have been
watching the world rise from its ashes.\e"
MK0120032,"\h(《Gilder》)So, this Great Silver Shrine carried the
Silvites to safety after they destroyed the
world. How convenient.\e"
MK0120033,\h(《Vyse》)You caused the Rains of Destruction!\e
MK0220000,"\h(《Dyne》)What the…?!
Why is the ground shaking?!\e"
MK0220001,"\h(《King Ixa'taka》)Isapa…
What is the meaning of this?\e"
MK0220002,"\h(《Isapa》)I do not know…
The winds are shifting… \e"
MK0220003,"\h(《Isapa》)Something is very, very wrong…\e"
MK0220004,"\h(《Drachma》)What the… ?!
Aaaargh!\e"
MK0250000,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse… Now you'll get to see what lies beyond
the sunset.\e"
MK0250001,"\h(《Gilder》)This is amazing!
We're almost as high as the Moons.\e"
MK0250002,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, look!
Over by the Silver Moon! 
There's something there!\e"
MK0250003,\h(《Fina》)That is my home… the Great Silver Shrine.\e
ML0020000,\h(《Lower City Person》)… Feels like a storm is brewin'.\e
ML0020001,"\h(《Lower City Person》)Hey, look at the Moon. Is that an eclipse?\e"
ML0020002,"\h(《Upper City Person》)The Moon looks rather odd, wouldn't you say?\e"
ML0020003,"\h(《Upper City Person》)Who cares about the Moon!
We're late for a party, and I simply look
ravishing in my new dress.\e"
ML0020004,"\h(《Belleza》)Your Majesty!
Perhaps, you would be more comfortable
sitting…\e"
ML0020005,"\h(《Enrique》)Belleza…
Look… look at the Moon!!\e"
ML0020006,"\h(《Alfonso》)You're on your own Empress… I'm getting out of 
here!\e"
ML0020007,\h(《Teodora》)Guards! Escort me out of here at once!\e
ML0020008,\h(《Belleza》)Enrique! Hang on!!!\e
ML0020009,\h(《Enrique》)Don't worry about me! Just go!!!\e
ML0020010,"\h(《Enrique》)The Grand Fortress is still standing!!! We're 
trapped!!!\e"

ML0020012,"\h(《Galcian》)Ha ha ha ha!
Excellent!\e"
ML0020013,"\h(《Galcian》)I have won!
Now, all shall bow before me!\e"
ML0020014,\h(《Galcian》)The world is mine!\e
ML0020015,\h(《Belleza》)… Prince… Enrique… ???\e
ML0020016,\h(《Enrique》)Ugh… ugh…\e
ML0020017,"\h(《Belleza》)Your Majesty!
You're alive…\e"
ML0020018,\h(《Enrique》)Belleza…\e
ML0020019,"\h(《Enrique》)Belleza… I… I thank you.
Thank you for saving my life. \e"
ML0020020,"\h(《Belleza》)There's no need to thank me…
It's a miracle that either of us is alive.\e"
ML0020021,"\h(《Enrique》)Valua…
What happened to Valua?!
Are the people alright?!\e"
ML0020022,"\h(《Enrique》)Belleza…?
Belleza, what happened?!\e"
ML0020023,\h(《Enrique》)… What?\e
ML0020024,"\h(《Enrique》)No… it… it can't be.
It's not real… It can't be real!!!\e"
ML0020025,"\h(《Enrique》)Belleza, please…
Please tell me that this is all just a bad 
dream…\e"
ML0020026,\h(《Belleza》)Prince Enrique… I'm… sorry.\e
ML0070000,"\h(《Gilder》)The skies are clear, and we've got the wind 
behind us.\e"
ML0070001,"\h(《Gilder》)Considering we're about to enter a battle over
the fate of the world, the weather is pretty
good.\e"
ML0070002,"\h(《Baltor》)Hurry up and give us the command to attack! 
My men are getting restless!\e"
ML0070003,"\h(《Baltor》)This is the longest they've gone without 
attackin' someone! And they're gettin' jumpy!\e"
ML0070004,"\h(《Clara》)Vyse, the Primrose awaits your command.
We're ready to fight!\e"

ML0070007,"\h(《Gordo》)Captain Vyse! We're ready for some action! We've
got a personal score to settle with the Armada!\e"
ML0070008,"\h(《Gilder's Crew》)Captain Gilder, we'll take care of The Claudia 
while you're gone! We'll try and get her back to
you in one piece!\e"
ML0070009,"\h(《Centime》)The Iron Clad isn't much of a warship, but it's
the most maneuverable ship in the fleet. We're 
also hoping that they underestimate us.\e"
ML0070010,"\h(《Daigo》)Don't worry about a thing, Vyse.
The Tenkou and the rest of the Yafutoman Navy
are right behind you!\e"
ML0070011,\h(《Daigo》)This is gonna be good!\e
ML0070012,"\h(《Drachma》)Boy…
Let's get movin'! The Harpoon Cannon is ready 
for action!\e"

Right here, right now! Let's make history!\e"

Full speed to Soltis!\e"

How is that thing still flying?!\e"

They're getting away!\e"

Looks like we're going to have to do this the 
old fashioned way!\e"
ML0120003,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright everyone! Prepare to board the Hydra! 
We're going to fight Galcian face to face.\e"
ML0190000,"\h(《Ramirez》)You…
How could you…\e"
ML0190001,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez, stop! Please!
I don't want to fight you!\e"

There's no going back!\e"

we'll all be crushed!\e"
ML0190017,\h(《Vyse》)That's Zelos?\e
ML0190018,"\h(《Fina》)Zelos will consume the mind and body of the

pick them off.\c"
M90010000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)This region of the sky is like a giant maze.
There are sky rifts and islands all over the
place.\e"
M90010001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)We need to be careful around here. There are
lots of spots where Air Pirates can hide and
ambush us.\c"
M90010002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Shrine Island? Forget it. No one in their right
mind would go near the place.\e"
M90010003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I've heard that there are monsters on that
island, and if you fly close enough, you can
hear them at night when the winds are still.\c"
M90010004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)It was incredible! I heard this really loud
rumble, and my ship started shaking. I looked
over the side…\e"
M90010005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)… I saw a whole fleet of Valuan warships. I
wonder where they were going. With a fleet that
large, they must have been attacking someone.\c"
M90010006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you're looking for Sailors' Island, it's
northeast of here. Just look for the
lighthouse… it'll guide you to the port.\e"
M90010007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You'll see it right after you go through the
rock tunnel.\c"
M90010008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)From what I hear, Valua has added another
admiral to it's ranks. That makes six main
fleets in the Armada now.\e"
M90010009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)With that many ships, they must be up to
something. I wouldn't want to get on their bad
side.\c"
M90010010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Where'd you get that ship?! I've never seen a
ship like that before!\e"
M90010011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Wait a second… That's a Valuan Ship! You stole
it!!! You're either very brave… or very
stupid!\c"
M90010012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Is that right? There's really a land called
Yafutoma in the far east?\e"
M90010013,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)What?! You say you can reach Yafutoma by going
west, too? Wait… I don't get it…\c"
M90010014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe it… Valua has been completely
destroyed. You can still smell the smoke at 100
leagues, if you're downwind.\c"
M90020000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Say, you must be members of the infamous Dyne
Clan. We've been hearing a lot about you guys
lately!\e"
M90020001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)We hear you've been really stirring things up
over in Valua. Keep up the good work.
We're behind you all the way.\c"
M90020002,\h(《Merchant Ship》)I saw a Moon Stone hit Shrine Island yesterday.\e
M90020003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That stone is as good as gone. You'd have to be
crazy to go after it. Shrine Island is haunted,
you know.\c"
M90020004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You're going to Valua? Just head north from
here. It should be easy to find. But, you'll
need a passport to get in.\e"
M90020005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Passports are usually only issued to a very
small number of merchants who are permitted to
trade with Valua.\c"
M90020006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I just heard that the Ship Parts Merchant in
Sailors' Island just got in a shipment of
Secondary Cannons.\e"
M90020007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)All of the stores in Sailors' Island get regular
shipments of new goods every now and then. You
should check back there often.\c"
M90020008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)A Valuan ship! Please spare me! I have done
nothing wrong! I have a family to feed!!\e"
M90020009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)What? You're Air Pirates? Heh… You scared me
there for a second. But wait… I suppose I
should still be scared, huh?\c"
M90020010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You said you sailed around the world? Ha! Yeah,
right! What kind of fool do you take me for?
Everyone knows the world is flat!\c"
M90020011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That massive island came up from Deep Sky and
now the sky rifts are gone!\e"
M90020012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I wonder if the sky rifts were formed when the
island sank into Deep Sky in the first place.\c"
M90020013,\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe that island rose from Deep Sky!\e
M90020014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Think of the impact that it's going to have on
all of the trade routes.\c"
M90200000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)This region is called Mid Ocean. All of the
trade routes pass through here.\e"
M90200001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That's Sailors' Island, over there. It's in the
middle of all of the trade routes, so it's a
great place to gather information.\c"
M90200002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Wow! That's an impressive weapon you have there.
Hey, is that a Harpoon Cannon? I've heard those
things can blast through stone reefs!\e"
M90200003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you pass through that stone reef, and
continue west, you'll see Nasr. You'll know
you're there when you see a huge desert.\c"
M90200004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Have you heard? They say that Nasrad, the
capital of Nasr, has been destroyed.\e"
M90200005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)An Admiral named Ramirez leveled the place. Some
of the merchants are helping the refugees.\c"
M90200006,\h(《Merchant Ship》)They've reopened the route to Cape Victory!\e
M90200007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Now that engineers are developing engines that
can power through sky rifts, it's even safe to
go to Esparanza now!\e"
M90200008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)A few advances in technology can really change
the world.\c"
M90200009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I heard a rumble, then there were some strong
gusts of wind. I was trying to keep control of
my ship, and that island came out of nowhere!\e"
M90200010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Some merchants see this as an opportunity to
make a profit, but not me! I'm more concerned
with staying alive!\c"
M90200011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You guys are amazing! You actually defeated the
Valuan Armada! I can't believe it!\e"
M90200012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)But the Valuans still have a base on that huge
island! I hope you can send that thing back into
Deep Sky where it belongs!\c"
M91200000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Just recently, trade routes have been
established in North Ocean!\e"
M91200001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I heard that Gordo, the Air Pirate, actually
opened a restaurant out there, and I heard
that the food is really good, too!\c"
M91200002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I'm not about to let that new continent scare me
away! Trade has been better than ever, lately.\e"
M91200003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I know Air Pirates spend all their time going
after treasure, but we have to make an honest
living.\c"
M90210000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you head due north from here, you'll run into
Valua.\e"
M90210001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Be careful, they won't let you in without a
Valuan Passport. And forget about sneaking
in, there are patrols all over the place.\c"
M90210002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You guys are pirates, aren't you? If you are,
I'd stay clear of Valua. If they catch you,
you're as good as dead.\e"
M90210003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Valua has strict laws against piracy. If they
even think you're a pirate, they bring you to
the Coliseum and execute you.\c"
M90210004,\h(《Merchant Ship》)Did you hear what happened in Valua?\e
M90210005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)There's rumors that someone actually broke out
of the Grand Fortress. I'd like to meet that
guy, and shake his hand.\c"
M90210006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I've seen a lot of Valuan construction ships in
the area. They must be working on something
pretty big.\c"
M90210007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Hey, did you hear? Valua is constructing a new
base. They are building it on Dangral Island.\e"
M90210008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)None of our ships can fly low enough to get a
good look at it, but there's been lots of
construction ships in the area.\e"
M90210009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)With that ship of yours, you might be able to
see what's going on. Go south and and start
searching under the clouds. You can't miss it.\c"
M90210010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You should be able to see the base, if you fly
south from here and search under the clouds.\c"
M90210011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)There's been a lot of Valuan ships around here
lately, so we figured that they were up to
something…\e"
M90210012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)But I never would have guessed that they were
capable of raising an entire continent out of
Deep Sky.\c"
M90210013,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe it! You guys were amazing! I
never thought I'd see all of the Air Pirates
join forces and attack the Armada head on.\e"
M90210014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)By winning that battle, you guys changed the 
course of the world! Who knows what would 
have happened if the Armada had won?\c"
M90050000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Welcome to Nasr, the desert kingdom!\e"
M90050001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)There's a port called Maramba nearby. Your ship
looks like it's been through quite a bit. Maybe
you should restock your supplies there.\c"
M90050002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)It looks like your ship is from Nasr, but you
don't look Nasrean. I should warn you…\e"
M90050003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)With a ship that small, you would never make it
through the stone reefs that surround our
beautiful desert. You should turn back.\c"
M90050004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you go southwest from here, you'll reach
South Ocean, there are some really strong
headwinds there, so be careful.\e"
M90050005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)It is uncharted territory… no one has ever made
it through South Ocean before, although many
have tried.\c"
M90050006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Cape Victory? I've heard of it. It's on the
southern tip of Nasr.\e"
M90050007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you want to go there, although I can't
imagine why anyone would go there, you'll have
to fly through a sky rift. Good luck trying…\c"
M90050008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Items from the newly discovered continent have
already begun to make their way into the
marketplaces of the rest of the world.\e"
M90050009,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Nasrad may have been destroyed, but as long as
there are goods to trade, merchants like us
will survive.\c"
M90050010,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Soltis… Yes, I've heard that name before. It
was the name of an ancient civilization.
Some of our historians have records of it.\e"
M90050011,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)The legends state that the Moons themselves
pushed the entire continent into Deep Sky.\c"
M90060000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Hail, travelers! I am a merchant from the
Kingdom of Nasr.\e"
M90060001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)My primary trade is in carpets and Red Moon
Stones.\c"
M90060002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)During ship battles, sometimes your gunners will
lose sight of their targets. Any gunner worth
his salt will shout “Lost” when this happens.\e"
M90060003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)This often happens when your opponent gets
behind you in the heat of battle.\c"
M90060004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I heard that the Valuan Armada attacked Nasrad,
and destroyed the city!\e"
M90060005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I'll bet they burned my shop to the ground, too.
Damn Valuans!\c"
M90060006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)My shop in Nasrad is gone… destroyed in the
attack. I have no idea what I'm going to do
now…\c"
M90060007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)First, the Armada leveled Nasrad, now it looks
like they're going to destroy the rest of the
world too.\e"
M90060008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Please… I know who you are… I've heard of
tales of your bravery… I beg you. Please… stop
them. You're the only one who can.\c"
M91060000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Welcome to Nasrad, the capital of our kingdom!\e"
M91060001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)We have riches beyond your wildest dreams…
We are truly blessed by the Red Moon.
Enjoy your stay…\c"
M91060002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Your ship is able to fly beneath the clouds, I'm
sure you've seen some amazing things.\e"
M91060003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I bet there're strange creatures and sunken
ships down there, eh?\e"
M90220002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)The Nasr fleet protects our trade routes from
Black Pirates. That's why Nasr is so profitable.
Everyone trades with us, because it's safe.\c"
M90220003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)The capitol of Nasr, may have been
destroyed, but not the spirit of the Nasr
people. They've already started rebuilding.\e"
M90220004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I know that a new city will rise from the ashes
of the old.\c"
M90230000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you keep heading south, you'll run into South
Ocean. Traveling through there is almost
impossible.\e"
M90230001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)There are some really strong headwinds there…
Most ships can't handle it. It's best to
avoid that area completely.\c"
M90230002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What?!
You're really going to try to cross South Ocean?
But, no one has ever crossed it before!!\e"
M90230003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What is it with young people these days?
You could get killed! Well, don't say I didn't
warn you.\c"
M90230004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What?! You mean to tell me that you crossed
South Ocean and discovered a new continent?\e"
M90230005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Hmm… If that's true, it might be possible to
start a new trade route through South Ocean.\c"
M90230006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)We tried to set up a trade route with the new
continent through South Ocean, but the headwinds
were too strong.\e"
M90230007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Trade routes have opened in North Ocean, but
that doesn't help us here in the South.\c"
M90230008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I don't know if it has anything to do with the
appearance of that huge island, but the
skies of South Ocean are calm.\e"
M90230009,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Once the war is over, I may be able to open up
that trade route to the new continent like I've
been wanting to.\e"
M90230010,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I'm counting on you, Vyse! It's entirely on your
shoulders! Think of the possibilities! Think of
the money!\c"
M90150000,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I don't think I've ever seen a ship like that
around here before. I'll bet it's a Moon Stone
Trader coming to dig up Yellow Moon Stones.\e"
M90150001,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Just so you know, the Moon Stones in this area
have already been mined, so there's hardly any
left.\e"

find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"

find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as

M90150004,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Ah, protecting us from Air Pirates… Good. It's
always nice to see that the Valuan Armada is
looking out for us.\e"
M90150005,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I've heard that there's an Air Pirate named Vyse
who thinks he can outwit the Armada. I hope you
catch him!\c"
M90150006,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)It's shocking news! Lord Galcian has rebelled
against Empress Teodora!\e"
M90150007,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I, I never would have imagined that our glorious
empire would errupt into civil war! I wonder
what Lord Galcian is after…\c"
M90150008,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I couldn't believe my eyes. Moon Stones were
falling on Valua… like rain!\e"
M90150009,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)When the rain stopped, there was nothing left…
Valua has been destroyed.\c"

“Leave.”\e"
M90160003,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Valua discovered Ixa'taka several years ago and
immediately conquered it.\e"
M90160004,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Today it is a colony of Valua. The people of
Ixa'taka have been put to work as slaves in
order to get Moon Stones.\c"
M90160005,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this

the greatest explorers of our time.\e"

good luck. It's not easy finding anything that
Domingo hasn't already discovered.\e"

wealth of new goods from the new continent back

there's always pirates that want to steal it.

happened to them?\c"

me here, so let me tell you a little secret.\e"
M90250002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a
wonderful flower called the “Balloon Flower.”
It's very beautiful.\e"
M90250003,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)You will also find a huge flock of insects that
flutter in the wind if you travel to the land
where Ixa'taka meets the Land of the Red Moon.\e"
M90250004,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)… Travel high in the sky to find
“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90250005,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a

It's very beautiful.\e"
M90250006,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)You will also find a huge flock of insects that

M90250007,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)… Travel high in the sky to find
“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90110000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I'm a fisherman. I've been chasing after a fish
called “Hamahai” for a long time.\e"
M90110001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)This fish called “Hamahai” is a really rare
species that's found only in the skies high
above Yafutoma.\e"
M90110002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)They fetch a great price, of course. If you have
the time, you might want to see if you can snag
some.\c"
M90120000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Who are you guys anyway? And how do you manage
to stay in the air with those steel ships of
yours?\e"
M90120001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I know who you are! You're Westerners! I've read
about people from the West, but you're the first
Westerners that I've actually seen!\e"
M90120002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Thanks to Prince Daigo, the Tenkou fleet has now
been recognized as an official part of the
Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120003,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)They don't have to stay in the ranks either.
Because they're Air Pirates, they're better at
guerilla tactics and boarding enemy ships!\c"
M90120004,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Prince Daigo already set sail towards the west
with the rest of the Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120005,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I think Yafutoma is better off with Prince Daigo
as a Naval Commander. It was a mistake to exile
him in the first place.\c"
M90260000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Mount Kazai is our most impressive landmark. I
doubt any ships from the west would be able to
sail over it.\c"
M90260001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)What?! You're telling me that your ship can sail
over Mount Kazai?!\e"
M90260002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Well, I'm really impressed. My compliments
to your engineers.\c"
M90270000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Beyond the eastern sky, there is a stone reef. I
found a hole in it, but I've been too scared to
fly close to it.\e"
M90270001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)The other day, I finally got the courage to go
near it, but I saw someone in a strange-looking
ship, wearing a mask, so I flew away.\c"
M90750000,"\h(《Gordo》)There haven't been any fish around here since
that new island came out of Deep Sky.\e"
M90750001,"\h(《Gordo》)Anyone who takes food away from me will pay
dearly. Vyse, I hope you destroy them…\c"
M90750002,"\h(《Gordo》)What was that? 
You're looking for Gentum, Khale, and Kabal?\e"
M90750003,"\h(《Gordo》)I see… well, it looks like you are searching
for some exotic ingredients.\e"
M90750004,"\h(《Gordo》)Fortunately, we serve Kabal here in my
restaurant. I'd be more than happy to give
you some.\e"
M90750005,"\h(《Gordo》)It's always best to marinade it for a day or two
before cooking it… that's when all the flavors
start to come out. Good Kabal is very rare…\e"
M90750006,\h(　)You received “Kabal.”\e
M90750007,"\h(《Gordo》)Well then…
You're still looking for the other 2
ingredients, right?\e"
M90750008,"\h(《Gordo》)Hmm… It's a commonly used spice over in Nasr,
and it's easily recognizable by its scent.\e"
M90750009,"\h(《Gordo》)I'd be surprised if you couldn't find any in
Nasrad. After all, it is the largest trade city
in the world.\e"
M90750010,"\h(《Gordo》)And what else were you looking for? Ah yes…
Khale. The “Spice of Dreams” as it is sometimes
called.\e"
M90750011,"\h(《Gordo》)Not only does it spice up food, it actually
enhances the flavor of it as well.\e"
M90750012,"\h(《Gordo》)But, I have heard rumors that the last of the
Khale Trees burned down in the Valua - Nasr
War.\e"
M90750013,"\h(《Gordo》)In the Far East, there is an island that is made
up entirely of spices. If you can find that
island, you may be in luck.\c"
M90750014,"\h(《Gordo》)I think you'll be able to find “Gentum” in
Nasrad.\e"
M90750015,"\h(《Gordo》)If you're looking for “Khale”, there may be some
on Spice Island in the Far East.\c"
M90750016,"\h(《Gordo》)Well, well… I see that the information that I
gave you on Gentum and Khale was helpful.\e"
M90750017,"\h(《Gordo》)If you ever have any more questions concerning
exotic ingredients, I'll be able to help. I'm
not called the Gourmet Pirate for nothing.\c"
M90760000,"\h(《Daigo》)Well, Vyse, this is it. The rest of us will be
watching your back from up here. Go Vyse, you're
the only one that can do this.\c"
M90760001,\h(《Jao》)We pray…\e
M90760002,\h(《Mao》)… for your victory.\c
M90780002,"\h(《Centime》)Vyse, if it is okay, could you take my son,
Hans, with you?\e"
M90780003,"\h(《Centime》)He looks up to you quite a bit. And even though
he's already very skilled at engineering, I
think it would be great training for him.\e"
M90780004,"\h(《Centime》)I think it is time for him to go off on his own
and make his mark in the world.\e"
M90780005,"\h(《Hans》)Vyse, take me with you! I'll do my best to be
of service!\e"
M90780006,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Of course!”
“Sorry, but I can't take you with me.”\e"
M90780007,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course!
I could use another good engineer on my ship!\e"
M90780008,\h(《Hans》)Really? Thank you so much!\e
M90780009,\h(　)Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M90780010,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, but I can't take you with me.
Doesn't Centime need you to work on his ship?\e"
M90780011,"\h(《Centime》)Don't worry about me, Vyse. I'm quite an
accomplished engineer myself. I've taught him
all that I can.\e"
M90780012,"\h(《Hans》)My father has trained me well! But I know there
is probably much more that I can learn by
working on your ship! Please!\e"
M90780013,"\h(《Vyse》)I see…
Alright, then. I'll take you with me.\e"
M90780014,\h(《Hans》)Thank you so much!\e
M90780015,\h(　)Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M90780000,"\h(《Centime》)Hans… You'll have to pull your own weight on
the Delphinus… And do what Captain Vyse tells
you to do.\e"
M90780001,"\h(《Hans》)Sure, Dad. You've taught me well, and I always
follow orders. I'll do everything I can to help
Captain Vyse.\c"
M90770000,"\h(《Gilder's Vice Captain》)Captain Gilder! You can leave the Claudia with
us! We'll take care of her!\e"
M90770001,"\h(《Willy》)Leave it to us! Wrrack!
Leave it to us!\c"
M90790000,"\h(《Clara》)Oh, Gilder… promise me… promise me that you'll
come back. I'll be waiting right here.\e"
M90790001,"\h(《Clara》)We will always be together. We'll watch the
sunset when you get back. It'll be so romantic.
You're such a dreamboat. My ring size is…\e"
M90790002,"\h(《Clara》)Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! What am I
saying!? Gilder, we can discuss this later…
Hurry back!\c"
M90790003,"\h(《Clara》)Oh, Gilder… promise me, promise me that you'll
come back to me!\e"
M91160000,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, on the Albatross, you always did your
best. You were always the first to board an
enemy ship, and nobody could stop you.\e"
M91160001,"\h(《Dyne》)I've always been proud of you. Maybe there were
times when I didn't show it, but I've never been
disappointed in you.\e"
M91160002,"\h(《Dyne》)Now, this is it. We've got the enemy cornered.
Don't give up, Vyse! I know you can do it!\c"
M92000000,"\h(《Baltor》)Don't you dare get yourself killed, now, Vyse!
Understand?! I want you to know I won't stand
for it!\e"
M92000001,"\h(《Baltor》)I'll kill you if you die fighting with those
clowns. Got that?! I'm the one who gets to kill
you! Me!\c"
M09902000,"\h(《Aika》)Visibility is horrible!
Vyse, the fog's too thick!
I can barely see!\e"
M09902001,"\h(《Vyse》)That's strange… there's never any fog in this
region… I wonder what's causing it.\e"
M09902002,"\h(《Vyse》)The only way to get to Valua is through here…
Slow to half speed…\e"
M09902003,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, wait… we're too close to that island
over there!\e"
M09903000,"\h(《Dyne》)Hey, you're going the wrong way.
There's nothing but open sky over there.\e"
M09903001,"\h(《Dyne》)Turn around and head back to Pirate Isle. This
is no time for you to be fooling around.\c"
M09903002,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, Vyse! You're heading the wrong way! Did you
forget how to read a compass or something?\e"
M09903003,"\h(《Aika》)Shrine Island is to the southwest of here!
That's when the little needle thingy is between
the “S” and the “W.”\c"
M09903004,"\h(《Aika》)Where are you going? We need to get back home to
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909900,"\h(《Dyne》)This is Shrine Island. Some people say that it's
some kind of ancient temple, others think it's
haunted.\e"
M09909901,"\h(《Dyne》)We don't have time to go sight-seeing. Turn the
ship around and head back to Pirate Isle.\c"
M09904000,"\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)Beyond this point is the Valuan Empire. Show me
your entry passport.\e"
M09904001,"\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)What?! You don't have a passport?! I cannot
allow you to go beyond this point! Go back to
the pit you crawled out of!\c"
M09904002,"\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)Beyond this point is the Valuan Empire. Show me
your entry passport.\e"
M09904003,"\h(《Vyse》)A passport? I've got one right here. Take your
time looking it over.\e"
M09904004,\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)… Hmm. Very well.\e
M09904005,\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)You may proceed.\c
M09906000,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M09906001,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M09906002,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M09908000,"\h(《Drachma》)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908001,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully made it
through there.\e"
M09908002,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
Sounds like fun. Let's give it a shot.\e"
M09908003,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot! Don't take it so lightly! If it was that
easy, I wouldn't be warnin' you like this!\e"
M09908004,"\h(《Drachma》)Small ships are torn apart by the fierce winds.
Even large ships need considerable power to just
move forward.\e"
M09908005,"\h(《Drachma》)The Little Jack's engine isn't strong enough to
get through here. We must turn back.\c"
M09908006,"\h(《Drachma》)This is South Ocean, boy. I thought I told you
that we'd never make it through there alive.
Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908007,"\h(《Bellena》)The area before you is called South Ocean. I'd
turn back if I were you.\e"
M09908008,"\h(《Bellena》)There's a strong wind that blows from the west
here. This place is known among sailors as one
of the most difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908009,"\h(《Bellena》)Nobody has ever made it through this place. And
nobody knows what lies on the other side,
either.\e"
M09908010,"\h(《Aika》)Wow…
I suppose we'd never make it through in this
tiny ship.\e"
M09908011,"\h(《Bellena》)This ship would probably be torn apart instantly
in the fierce winds.\e"
M09908012,"\h(《Bellena》)We would need a much, much more powerful engine
even to have a chance of making it through
there.\e"
M09908013,"\h(《Aika》)You're probably right. And besides… we should
be looking for the Red Moon Crystal right now,
anyway. Alright Vyse! Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908014,"\h(《Bellena》)I told you that this is South Ocean. We'd never
make it through there. Turn the boat around.\c"
M09908015,"\h(《Drachma》)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908016,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully sailed
through it.\e"
M09908017,"\h(《Vyse》)But the lands of the Green Moon are through
here, right?\e"
M09908018,"\h(《Vyse》)And besides, we have Belleza's engine now.
It's not like we don't have a chance of making
it through.\e"
M09908019,"\h(《Drachma》)Hmm…
Perhaps. But my knowledge of this place is
limited. You're on your own, boy.\e"
M09908020,"\h(《Drachma》)This isn't goin' to be an easy journey. Prepare
yourselves for the worst, kids.\c"
M09909910,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse! This is it! This is where the Red Moon
Crystal is buried!\e"
M09909911,"\h(《Vyse》)Great! Let's land this ship and search the place
right away!\e"
M09909912,\h(《Drachma》)……\e
M09909913,"\h(《Drachma》)… Wait, boy.
Head to town first. I've got some things that I
need to take care of.\e"
M09909914,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a port city named Maramba near here.
Go there first, got it?\e"
M09909915,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… sure. No problem. I just thought that we
could… um… never mind. It doesn't matter to
me.\c"
M09909916,"\h(《Drachma》)You can explore the temple later. Head to
Maramba first, boy.\c"
M09901100,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrumph…
So this is the Iron Net. I've heard rumors about
it.\e"
M09901101,"\h(《Drachma》)I heard that the Valuans built this to prevent
people from coming here from North Ocean.\e"
M09901102,"\h(《Drachma》)I guess they didn't want anyone to find out
about this new land.\e"
M09901103,"\h(《Aika》)I hate to say this, but I don't think we're
going to be able to break through that thing.
We should turn back.\c"
M09901104,"\h(《Drachma》)We'll never be able to break through the Iron
Net, boy. Turn this boat around.\c"
M09909920,"\h(《High Priest》)Did you people come from the east?
Then I have nothing to talk to you about.
Go back to where you came from!\c"
M09909930,"\h(《Drachma》)This looks like the Valuan headquarters here
in these parts.\e"
M09909931,"\h(《Drachma》)Who knows what will happen if we just go
wanderin' around in there. We shouldn't get too
close, boy.\c"
M09901400,"\h(《Drachma》)What are you doin', boy?! Are you tryin' to
leave Valua?!\e"
M09901401,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah! Aren't we supposed to be looking for the
Yellow Crystal around here? Turn this boat
around Vyse!\c"
M09901402,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901403,"\h(《Drachma》)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09901500,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, hey! Where do you think you're going, Vyse?
That's Valuan homeland over there!\e"
M09901501,"\h(《Gilder》)Don't you think we have better things to do
than to pick another fight with the Valuans?
We should probably avoid this area.\c"
M09901502,"\h(《Aika》)Wait a second there, Fina. Isn't that Valua up
ahead?\e"
M09901503,"\h(《Aika》)What are we going to do with this little boat if
the Valuans decide to attack us? We probably
should stay out of there for now.\c"
M09901600,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901601,"\h(《Drachma》)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09909940,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! Look over there! There's some kind of
vortex! Maybe we can go inside it!\e"
M09909941,"\h(《Enrique》)Ugh… Per… Perhaps we should head over to…
ugh… Esparanza, first…\e"
M09909942,"\h(《Enrique》)I don't know… how much longer I can take…
this before I… ulp!\e"
M09909943,"\h(《Aika》)Heh… I swear… What are we going to do with
you, Enrique? I suppose we have no choice for
now. Vyse, let's head over to Esparanza!\c"
M09909944,"\h(《Enrique》)Ugh…
Please… can't we just… stop by Esparanza
first? I'm begging you… ulp!\c"
M09909945,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like we can get inside the Dark Rift
through here. Enrique, are you ready?\e"
M09909946,"\h(《Enrique》)… Yes, I'm ready. I don't suppose I have much
of a choice at this point. We must get through
the Dark Rift no matter what.\e"
M09909947,"\h(《Enrique》)Don't mind me… I will be fine. This is neither
the time nor the place to be complaining about
airsickness.\c"
M09902400,"\h(《Gilder》)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09902401,"\h(《Gilder》)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09902402,"\h(《Fina》)Aika… It looks like we've gone a little too far
to the north.\e"
M09902403,"\h(《Aika》)I think you're right.
Who knows what's up ahead. It might be a little
dangerous to go exploring right now.\e"
M09902404,"\h(《Aika》)And from what I can tell of the map, Daccat's
Island probably isn't north of here anyway.
Let's turn around and continue searching.\c"
M09909952,"\h(《Gilder》)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09909953,"\h(《Gilder》)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09909950,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse… do not return to Crescent Isle. I beg of
you.\e"
M09909951,"\h(《Enrique》)If I go back now… I… I'm afraid that my
determination will falter. I cannot allow myself
to do that…\c"
M09909960,"\h(《Vyse》)What's this?
There's something set into the statue's eye
socket…\e"
M09909961,\h(　)You found the “Golden Man's Eye.”\e
M09909962,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, no one will notice if it's missing, right?
And besides… we're Air Pirates!! Can you really
blame us for taking a little bit of treasure?\c"
M09909963,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm? Hey, Aika… do you see something glittering
on the ground? Right where the eye of that bird
would be…\e"
M09909964,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, you're right! Let me go down and see what
it is…\e"
M09909965,"\h(《Aika》)… Hey, Vyse! I found something! There was a gem
stuck into the ground! I'm sure they won't miss
a little, itty-bitty gem, would they?\e"
M09909966,\h(　)You found the “Great Bird's Eye.”\e
M09909967,"\h(《Aika》)Besides, who knows when a nice little gem like
this will come in handy?\c"
M09909968,"\h(《Fina》)I…
I can't believe that they actually used the
Rains of Destruction…\e"
M09909969,\h(《Aika》)Fina…\e
M09909970,"\h(《Gilder》)… Vyse, maybe we should head back to Crescent
Isle and take a minute to regroup. We can't do
anything to get into Soltis right now, anyway.\e"
M09909971,"\h(《Vyse》)… You're right.
I really hate to do this, but it looks like we
have no choice but to just head home for now.\c"
M09909972,"\h(《Vyse》)There's an incredibly strong wind blowing from
inside the Dark Rift.\e"
M09909973,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like it's going to be tough to get
through there even with the Delphinus…\c"
M09909974,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm… It looks like we've come out of the Dark
Rift on the same side that we went in on.\c"
M09909975,"\h(《Aika》)On the treasure map it says, “The dead will
always watch over my treasure.”\e"
M09909976,"\h(《Aika》)And there's a skull here on the eastern part of
the Valuan continent. I wonder if that has to
do with anything…\c"
M09909977,"\h(《Vyse》)… What's this place? Why are there buildings
being built on an island way down here?!\c"
M09909994,"\h(《Vyse》)It's too dangerous to go back there right now.
And, besides… I shouldn't let Gregorio's
sacrifice be in vain.\c"
M09909995,"\h(《Aika》)This is the Armada's homebase. We probably
shouldn't get too close, or we'll be asking for
trouble. Let's just turn the ship around…\c"
M09909978,"\h(《Aika》)We did it!!
We actually made it through the Dark Rift!!\e"
M09909979,"\h(《Enrique》)Well! I can't believe that we are actually going
to be able to see what lies east of the Dark
Rift! We're making history as we speak!\c"
M09909980,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! There are so many herbs and spices growing
here! I've never seen so many in one place
before!\e"
M09909981,"\h(《Vyse》)It's amazing… This place truly is a treasure
island.\e"
M09909982,"\h(《Fina》)But we really shouldn't disturb the island too
much…\e"
M09909983,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah… I suppose that if we took too many of the
seeds and stuff that the trees might not be able
to grow back.\e"
M09909984,"\h(《Aika》)… But, I'm sure it would be okay just to take a
little bit, right Vyse?\e"
M09909985,"\h(《Vyse》)I swear, Aika. You and your “just a little bit.”
Alright, alright… we'll take something with us.\e"
M09909986,\h(　)You received the spice “Khale.”\e
M09909987,"\h(《Drachma》)King Ixa'taka spoke of an Iron Net to the north
of this continent.\e"
M09909988,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah… But, if the Valuans escaped to the north,
that means they probably had to take down the
Iron Net, right?\e"
M09909989,"\h(《Drachma》)That means we'll be able to reach North Ocean
that way. We'll head straight to Valua from
there.\c"
M09909990,"\h(《Enrique》)In truth, the Delphinus has not yet been
completed.\e"
M09909991,"\h(《Enrique》)The hull hasn't been fully reinforced yet, so it
would probably be impossible to fly through
stone reefs at this point.\e"
M09909992,"\h(《Enrique》)And the engine's output settings haven't been
properly adjusted yet either, so we probably
won't be able fly through sky rifts.\e"
M09909993,"\h(《Engine》)However, if we can find some way to fix the hull
and the engine, I'm sure sky rifts and stone
reefs would pose no problem for this ship.\e"
M09909000,\h(《Dyne》)Wait… that's the legendary “Pirate's Grave!”\e
M09909001,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Good job, Vyse! I'm sure that the Sailors' Guild
would be more than happy to pay you for making
this Discovery!\e"
M09909002,"\h(《Vyse》)Guild?
Pay me for a Discovery?\e"
M09909003,"\h(《Dyne》)Much of this world is uncharted and shrouded
in legend. Ruins, strange creatures… all
sorts of things are waiting to be discovered.\e"
M09909004,"\h(《Dyne》)Any major port city will have a Sailors' Guild.
They pay explorers well for any information on
Discoveries that they've made.\e"
M09909005,"\h(《Dyne》)When you're flying through the skies and your
compass starts spinning around rapidly, that
means there's a Discovery nearby.\e"
M09909006,"\h(《Dyne》)If you try searching the area, you'll probably
find a Discovery. Just head over to the Sailors'
Guild afterwards and collect your reward.\e"
M09909007,"\h(《Dyne》)But, the longer you wait, the greater the chance
that someone else will beat you to it. So, you
should visit the Guild as soon as you can, okay?\c"
M09909008,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, before we set sail, do you have any
questions that you wanted to ask me?\e"
M09909009,"\h(《What will you say?》)“How do I steer this thing?”
“How do we get home from here?”
“No, not really.”\e"
M09909010,"\h(《Vyse》)Just to be safe, how exactly do I steer this
thing?\e"
M09909011,"\h(《Dyne》)I never thought I'd hear you ask something like
that. Heh… Nevertheless, pay close attention.\e"
M09909012,"\h(《Dyne》)Using the Control Stick, you can
move forward and backward.
You can turn left and right as well.\e"
M09909013,"\h(《Dyne》)Control your altitude by pressing the R and L
Buttons. R Button will raise the ship, while L
Button will lower it. The C Stick works as well.\e"
M09909014,"\h(《Dyne》)Whenever you want to search anything or whenever
you want to dock at a harbor, just press the
A Button.\e"
M09909015,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… don't laugh at me, Dad… er… Captain, but
I don't remember the way home from here. Could
you tell me where to go?\e"
M09909016,"\h(《Dyne》)How do you expect to become a good sailor if you
don't pay attention to where you are?! Just head
southeast from here.\e"
M09909017,"\h(《Dyne》)You'll recognize the island when you see it... 
hopefully. If you get lost, you can look at a
map using the Y Button.\e"
M09909018,"\h(《Dyne》)Also, you'll run into monsters on occasion as
you're sailing. If you do, run out to the deck
and take 'em out.\e"
M09909019,"\h(《Dyne》)One word of warning: there are these monsters
called Maroccas that live around here. They're
pretty tough.\e"
M09909020,"\h(《Dyne》)If you're not doing much damage on your enemy,
try hitting the Y Button to change the
properties of your weapon. It might work better.\c"
M09909021,"\h(《Dyne》)Well, then! Full speed ahead! Destination,
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909022,"\h(《Drachma》)That reminds me… you should have received
something called a “Captain's Stripe.”\e"
M09909023,"\h(《Drachma》)You'll receive one for every major battle that
you win. It's sort of like a trophy.\e"
M09909024,"\h(《Drachma》)If you “Use” a Captain's Stripe, it will make
your ship stronger.\e"
M09909025,"\h(《Vyse》)I see. Thanks for the advice, Captain.\c"
M09909026,"\h(《Drachma》)It looks like we picked up a “Magic Cannon” from
the lady admiral.\e"
M09909027,"\h(《Drachma》)Using this, we'll be able to fire cannonballs
charged with magical energy.\e"
M09909028,"\h(《Aika》)Just like Belleza was doing, right? That's
great! Vyse! Did you hear that?! We should
really put this thing to good use!\e"
M09909029,"\h(《Drachma》)Be careful though, boy. Using the Magic Cannon
uses up MP just like normal magic. So don't go
too crazy with it.\c"
M80600000,"\h(《Doc》)So, how're things going? Did you catch any
Moonfish?\e"
M80600001,"\h(《Doc》)Maria's counting on you! Make sure to bring back
a bunch of Moonfish for Maria's little friend!\c"
M80600002,"\h(《Doc》)Hey, guys! How've you been?
Thanks to all your hard work,
Maria and I have been doing just fine.\e"
M80600003,"\h(《Doc》)And hey... if you're ever in the area, feel
free to just stop on by whenever you want!\e"
M80600004,"\h(《Maria》)Vyse, come back soon!\c"
M80600005,"\h(《Maria》)Uncle Doc isn't here right now...
He had to go work.\e"
M80600006,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh really? I guess we should come back
some other time then...\e"
M80600007,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright, Maria. We'll be back soon!\c"
MQ0010000,"\h(《Curt Voice》)Hm? Can I help you? This ship here is a free
medical vessel. Are you here for treatment? You
sick or something?\e"
MQ0010001,"\h(《Vyse》)No, we're fine. We were just passing through the
area and saw your ship. We figured we'd come and
see who you were.\e"
MQ0010002,"\h(《Curt Voice》)Wait a second... your clothes! Your weapons!
Your eyepatch! You guys are Air Pirtes!\e"
MQ0010003,"\h(《Curt Voice》)You're just in time. There is something that I
want to ask of you guys... Please, come inside.\e"
MQ0010033,"\h(《Doc》)There should be Moonfish near or on Sailors'
Island. I'm sure if you look hard enough, you
can find them.\e"
MQ0010034,"\h(《Doc》)Be sure to check on top of roofs and behind
buildings! Check everywhere using your first
person point of view! Good luck!\c"
MQ0080000,"\h(《Young Female Voice》)So, you're the infamous Vyse. I pictured you to
be... taller. Nevertheless, I see that you have
taken the Black Spot that I put out.\e"
MQ0080001,\h(《Young Female Voice》)Stand by. I am boarding your ship.\c
MQ0180100,"\h(《Aika》)Hey... This looks like the ship of one of the
Pirates on the Sailors' Guild Wanted List!\e"
MQ0180101,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Move in closer.”
“Stay where you are.”\c"
MQ0180102,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm... This might turn into a bad situation if
we approach that ship now. Maybe we should
talk to him when we're a little more ready...\e"
MQ0220100,"\h(《Aika》)Isn't it a little fishy for a boat to be out
sailing alone way out here?\e"
MQ0220101,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Move in closer.”
“Stay where you are.”\c"
MQ0220102,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm... This might turn into a bad situation if
we approach that ship now. Maybe we should
talk to him when we're a little more ready...\e"
M80600008,"\h(《Doc》)Sorry, but I'm about to make a house call.
Can ya come back a little later?\c"
MQ0260100,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Enter Headquarters.”
“Fight the Special Air Pirate.”
“Return to the skies.”\c"
