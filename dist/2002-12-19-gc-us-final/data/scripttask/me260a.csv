MQ0010004,"\h(《Ship Doctor》)I apologize for the abruptness. I know you don't
really need my services and have no need to
stay, but I have a favor to ask of you.\e"
MQ0010005,"\h(《Ship Doctor》)But first, let me introduce myself. The name's
Doc,or that's what everyone calls me. I'm a free
doctor; I don't have a country to call home.\e"
MQ0010006,"\h(《Doc》)But, that lets me live the way I want to. So, I
fly the skies and heal sick and injured sailors
wherever the winds take me.\e"
MQ0010007,"\h(《Doc》)Oh, and this is Maria. She's a little quiet and
shy, but she's a good kid.\e"
MQ0010008,\h(《Maria》)......\e
MQ0010009,"\h(《Vyse》)...Right.
Now what was it that you wanted to ask us to
do?\e"
MQ0010010,"\h(《Doc》)Heh... Direct and to the point. I like that.
But, here. Take this lens. It's sort of related
to what I want to ask you.\e"
MQ0010011,"\h(《Doc》)That thing's called a “Moon Lens.” It's a
special lens made from Moonstones. With it, you
can see things you wouldn't normally be able to.\e"
MQ0010012,"\h(《Doc》)Here, put the lens on and look where I'm pointing.\e"
MQ0010013,"\h(《Vyse》)Whoa! There's something... some sort of creature
right there!!!\e"
MQ0010014,"\h(《Doc》)It's a “Moonfish.” They're tricky little fellas
to catch because they're, well, transparent. You
can only see them using that lens.\e"
MQ0010015,"\h(《Doc》)Which brings me to the favor that I wanted to
ask of you. I want you to find as many of these
Moonfish as you can and bring them back to me.\e"
MQ0010016,"\h(《Doc》)They tend to nest in populated areas for
whatever reason, so check towns and dungeons.\e"
MQ0010017,"\h(《Doc》)But, they try to keep out of most people's ways,
so look in hard to reach areas like behind
buildings, under bridges, and rooftops...\e"
MQ0010018,"\h(《Doc》)Oh, one more thing. Whenever you're near a
Moonfish, the Moon Lens I gave you will react
and make a sound, so pay attention.\e"
MQ0010019,"\h(《Vyse》)Ok. So I use this lens to see the little guys.
How in the 6 Moons am I supposed to catch them?\e"
MQ0010020,"\h(《Doc》)It's pretty easy, actually. Here, let me put the
Moon Lens into your goggles...\e"
MQ0010021,"\h(《Doc》)When I'm done, you can use it when you go into
first-person point of view (Y Button).\e"
MQ0010022,"\h(《Doc》)Once you find a Moonfish, a target will appear.
Line it up with the Moonfish.\e"
MQ0010023,"\h(《Doc》)And when you've got the Moonfish in your sights,
just press the A Button.\e"
MQ0010024,"\h(《Doc》)And here you go, the lens was a perfect fit.
Well? Sounds easy enough, right?\e"
MQ0010025,"\h(《Doc》)Actually, the reason for all this is a bit
strange. A little bird got lost and found its
way to my ship.\e"
MQ0010026,"\h(《Doc》)I decided to take care of it for now, but I just
don't get what this bird's problem is. He
refuses to eat anything other than Moonfish.\e"
MQ0010027,"\h(《Doc》)But, for whatever reason, Maria seems to have
really grown attached to the critter. So, I do
what I can to keep it happy.\e"
MQ0010028,\h(《Maria》)......\e
MQ0010029,"\h(《Doc》)It's... sorta my responsibility to take care of
Maria. Anything she wants, I provide. Of course,
there's only so much I can do.\e"
MQ0010030,"\h(《Doc》)But, I can't leave my ship. I can't leave Maria
here all alone. That's why I'm asking you for
this favor.\e"
MQ0010031,"\h(《Doc》)Of course, I will compensate you adequately.
Bring me lots of fish, and I'll give you items
in return.\e"
MQ0010032,"\h(《Doc》)So, please... if you find any Moonfish, bring
them to me! I will be eternally grateful.\c"
MQ0020000,\h(《Maria》)......\e
MQ0020001,"\h(《Doc》)Look how big your little bird has grown, Maria!
And it's all thanks to this young man and his
friends!\e"
MQ0020002,\h(《Maria》)......\e
MQ0020003,\h(《Maria》)......ank you.\e
MQ0020004,"\h(《Doc》)W, w, huh?! Maria!!! Did you just say
something?!\e"
MQ0020005,\h(《Maria》)...Thank you.\e
MQ0020006,"\h(《Doc》)M, Maria...\e"
MQ0020007,"\h(《Doc》)Vyse, I... I can't thank you enough.\e"
MQ0020008,"\h(《Doc》)I don't know how many years it's been since I've
heard Maria's voice.\e"
MQ0020009,"\h(《Aika》)What?! You mean to tell me that your own
daughter hasn't spoken to you in years???\e"
MQ0020010,"\h(《Doc》)Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up there, honey. I'm
still single. I don't even have a wife, let
alone a kid.\e"
MQ0020011,"\h(《Doc》)Maria's not my kid. She, uh... lost her family a
few years back.\e"
MQ0020012,"\h(《Doc》)I may not look the part now, but at one point in
my life, I was a Valuan soldier.\e"
MQ0020013,"\h(《Doc》)I worked for Mendosa, a former Admiral of
the Valuan Armada, as a doctor onboard his
flagship.\e"
MQ0020014,"\h(《Doc》)And Maria is his daughter... the daughter of a
Valuan Admiral.\e"
MQ0020015,"\h(《Doc》)However, when she was still very young, she lost
her father, and the rest of her family, in a
horrible accident.\e"
MQ0020016,"\h(《Doc》)It was a horrifying experience for such a little
kid to go through. Since then, she hasn't shown
a hint of emotion, or spoken a single word.\e"
MQ0020017,"\h(《Doc》)And I don't blame her, either. The poor kid had
to watch her family's ship, with all of her
family still onboard, sink below the clouds.\e"
MQ0020018,"\h(《Doc》)So, I took her under my wing, and retired from
the military. And that's when I became a free
ship doctor.\e"
MQ0020019,"\h(《Doc》)That's why it's... sorta my responsibility to
make sure Maria is happy. It's my resposibility,
and my punishment, of sorts.\e"
MQ0020020,"\h(《Doc》)Hm? Oh! I'll be right there, Maria!\e"
MQ0020021,"\h(《Doc》)Ever since she stopped talking, whenever she
needs me, she just rings her bell like that.\e"
MQ0020022,"\h(《Doc》)And every time I hear that bell, my heart nearly
breaks...\e"
MQ0020023,"\h(《Doc》)Vyse... I beg of you. Please find more
Moonfish.\e"
MQ0020024,"\h(《Doc》)The little bird, for whatever reason, seems to
be getting through to Maria. She seems to be
coming out of her shell at long last.\e"
MQ0020025,"\h(《Doc》)Who knows? Maybe Maria will actually smile again
someday! Heh... I probably shouldn't get my
hopes up, but I can't help it.\e"
MQ0020026,"\h(《Doc》)But, I'm going to bet on you. Something tells me
that if anyone can heal Maria's wounds, it's
you. I'm counting on you, Vyse!\c"
MQ0030000,\h(《Maria》)Thank you for bringing these fish for me.\e
MQ0030001,"\h(《Doc》)M, Maria!!\e"
MQ0030002,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh... For you, Maria, it's no problem at all.\e"
MQ0030003,"\h(《Vyse》)If it's Moonfish you want, just leave it up to
me! I'm going to bring you more than you'll ever
need!\e"
MQ0030004,\h(《Maria》)...Thank you!\e
MQ0030005,"\h(《Doc》)Thank you, Vyse. Maria is slowly becoming
herself again.\e"
MQ0030006,"\h(《Doc》)I owe everything to you. I don't know what to
say. I thank you from my the bottom of my heart.
I really do.\e"
MQ0030007,"\h(《Vyse》)Aww, come on, Doc! Don't get all teary-eyed on
me. I'll just keep gathering fish to make her
happy, ok?\e"
MQ0030008,"\h(《Doc》)You know, you remind me of a man
I used to work with.\e"
MQ0030009,"\h(《Doc》)He was a lot like you; honest, kind... the kind
of guy that everyone likes. Well, he was a
little more refined than you, though.\e"
MQ0030010,"\h(《Doc》)His name was Ramirez. I hear that he's been
promoted to the position of Admiral in the
Valuan Armada, now.\e"
MQ0030011,\h(《Fina》)...Ramirez?!\e
MQ0030012,\h(《Doc》)Huh? You guys know him?\e
MQ0030013,"\h(《Aika》)Well, more or less...\e"
MQ0030014,"\h(《Vyse》)Doc, can you tell us what you know about
Ramirez?\e"
MQ0030015,"\h(《Doc》)Uh, sure...\e"
MQ0030016,"\h(《Doc》)It was a long time ago... back when I was still
working for Admiral Mendosa in the
Valuan Armada.\e"
MQ0030017,"\h(《Doc》)We were sailing around Mid Ocean when we
encountered a ship of the likes we had never
seen before.\e"
MQ0030018,"\h(《Doc》)And aboard that ship was Ramirez. He was... an
odd fellow, to say the least. I distinctly
remember the clothes he had on... Very unusual.\e"
MQ0030019,"\h(《Doc》)But, Ramirez turned out to be as intelligent as
he was good with a blade. Admiral Mendosa grew
to like him rather quickly.\e"
MQ0030020,"\h(《Doc》)Admiral Mendosa saw that he had potential and
began training him to become an officer of the
Valuan Armada. He had high hopes for him...\e"
MQ0030021,"\h(《Doc》)We were all surprised at how little he knew
about the world, but he was so honest and so
sincere that everyone loved him.\e"
MQ0030022,"\h(《Doc》)And I, too, was glad to have a crewmate who
seemed trustworthy. Someone I could call a
friend.\e"
MQ0030023,"\h(《Mendosa》)Ramirez, from this day forth, you are a member
of the Valuan Armada. Hold your chin high!\e"
MQ0030024,"\h(《Ramirez》)Thank you very much for all your help, m'lord.\e"
MQ0030025,"\h(《Doc》)Way to go, Ramirez! I always knew you'd make
the cut.\e"
MQ0030026,"\h(《Ramirez》)Thank you, too, Doctor.\e"
MQ0030027,"\h(《Doc》)Oh come on, you can stop calling me “Doctor” all
the time. Everyone just calls me Doc.\e"
MQ0030028,\h(《Mendosa》)Hahahaha... You two never change.\e
MQ0030029,"\h(《Mendosa》)I just want to let you know, you two are like
sons to me. The sons I never had. I hope I can
count on you as my right hand men.\e"
MQ0030030,"\h(《Doc》)M'lord, yer being a little greedy there, aren't
ya? M'lord already has two lovely daughters of
his own, and yet he wants sons, too?\e"
MQ0030031,"\h(《Mendosa》)Hahahaha... That's not what I mean. All I'm
saying is that you two can count on me as you
would a father.\e"
MQ0030032,\h(《Ramirez》)......\e
MQ0030033,"\h(《Ramirez》)M'lord... I thank you. You do not know how much
that means to me.\e"
MQ0030034,"\h(《Vyse》)Who woulda thought that Doc and Ramirez used to
be buddies...\e"
MQ0030035,"\h(《Doc》)Alright, Maria! I hear ya! I'll be there in a
second!\e"
MQ0030036,"\h(《Doc》)Vyse, please feel free to come by and visit
whenever you want. I'm sure Maria and her little
feathered friend will be happy to see you.\e"
MQ0030037,"\h(《Doc》)But don't forget to bring more Moonfish with
you! I'm sure there's plenty more still out
there somewhere!\e"
MQ0040000,"\h(《Maria》)Thank you, Vyse. Picollo says thank you, too.\e"
MQ0040001,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh... His name is Picollo, huh? Cute name.\e"
MQ0040002,"\h(《Vyse》)Tell him that I'll bring even more fish next
time, okay?\e"
MQ0040003,\h(《Maria》)...Ok!\e
MQ0040004,\h(《Aika》)Maria can actually talk to that bird?\e
MQ0040005,"\h(《Doc》)Sure seems like it. I don't know for sure,
though. But either way, it looks like they
understand each other on some level.\e"
MQ0040006,"\h(《Doc》)Now that I think about it, even her older
sister...\e"
MQ0040007,\h(《Fina》)Um... Doc?\e
MQ0040008,\h(《Doc》)I'm sorry I'm sorry. I was lost in thought.\e
MQ0040009,"\h(《Fina》)Doc, please... tell me about Ramirez. When you
first knew him. I must know...\e"
MQ0040010,"\h(《Fina》)I need to know what happened to him... What
changed him so.\e"
MQ0040011,"\h(《Doc》)Hmm... Sounds like you've got some pretty
personal reasons for wanting to know.\e"
MQ0040012,"\h(《Doc》)Very well. I told you about how Ramirez and I
met, right?\e"
MQ0040013,"\h(《Doc》)Well, soon after that, we were sent to Ixa'taka,
just after Valua had begun to occupy the area.\e"
MQ0040014,"\h(《Doc》)What's wrong, Ramirez? Ever since we got to
Ixa'taka, you've looked troubled. Don't be
afraid to speak your mind.\e"
MQ0040015,\h(《Ramirez》)Well...\e
MQ0040016,"\h(《Ramirez》)If I may speak freely, I feel that Valua is
wrong in its ways... in the way it treats the
Ixa'takans.\e"
MQ0040017,"\h(《Doc》)H, hey wait a minute there, Ramirez!\e"
MQ0040018,"\h(《Ramirez》)Putting the people into slavery, forcing them to
mine for Moonstones... and all for Valua's
profit? It's horrible.\e"
MQ0040019,\h(《Doc》)Ramirez...\e
MQ0040020,"\h(《Mendosa》)...Ramirez.
You are absolutely right. I, as a father of two,
feel the same way.\e"
MQ0040021,"\h(《Mendosa》)I feel a sadness deep in my heart for the plight
of the people of Ixa'taka.\e"
MQ0040022,"\h(《Mendosa》)How's this, then? I will personally express
these grievances to the Empress herself. Let me
deal with it, Ramirez.\e"
MQ0040023,"\h(《Ramirez》)...Thank you, m'lord.\e"
MQ0040024,"\h(　)One day, we ran into Admiral Galcian in
Ixa'taka.\e"
MQ0040025,"\h(　)Back then, Lord Galcian was still just another
Admiral in the Armada, but stories of his
military prowess were spreading rapidly.\e"
MQ0040026,"\h(　)Actually, the reason why Valua had so easily
conquered Ixa'taka and occupied it was due to
the great military feats of Lord Galcian.\e"
MQ0040027,"\h(　)Of course, Ramirez went straight to Galcian,
being the root of all the evils in Ixa'taka.\e"
MQ0040028,"\h(《Ramirez》)Lord Galcian! How can you treat the Ixa'takans
like this?! It's despicable!\e"
MQ0040029,"\h(《Doc》)R, Ramirez! You can't talk like that to an
Admiral!!!\e"
MQ0040030,"\h(《Ramirez》)Stay out of this, Doc. This has nothing to do
with you. And no matter what happens, I know
Admiral Mendosa will stand up for me.\e"
MQ0040031,"\h(《Galcian》)Admiral Mendosa?
Heh... Fool.\e"
MQ0040032,"\h(《Ramirez》)What did you say?! How dare you speak ill of
Admiral Mendosa! I will not stand here and let
you tarnish his honor!\e"
MQ0040033,"\h(《Galcian》)It was not Mendosa that I called a fool.
It is you, boy, who follow him so blindly, that
is the fool.\e"
MQ0040034,"\h(《Ramirez》)Wh, what did you say?\e"
MQ0040035,"\h(《Galcian》)People are not to be trusted. Depend on a person
too much and they will betray your trust sooner
or later.\e"
MQ0040036,"\h(《Galcian》)I only believe in power. Power will never betray
you.\e"
MQ0040037,"\h(《Galcian》)And that is why I search this land for an even
greater power. And if such a power exists, I
swear, it shall be mine.\e"
MQ0040038,"\h(《Galcian》)You will someday understand the meaning of my
words. When that day comes, I will be awaiting
you.\e"
MQ0040039,\h(《Ramirez》)......\e
MQ0040040,"\h(《Doc》)That was the first time Ramirez and Galcian had
ever met.\e"
MQ0040041,"\h(《Doc》)If I had only stopped Ramirez back then, things
may have turned out much differently.\e"
MQ0040042,\h(《Maria》)Uncle Doc?\e
MQ0040043,"\h(《Doc》)Wait a second, Maria! I'll be right there!\e"
MQ0040044,"\h(《Maria》)Hehe... Ever since she started talking again,
Maria stopped using that bell and now she calls
me by name.\e"
MQ0040045,"\h(《Doc》)And it always makes me feel weak in the knees
whenever she calls me “uncle.” Heh... I'm such a
sucker for those pretty little eyes.\e"
MQ0040046,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, we'll get outta your way. You're
probably busy, anyway. We'll talk more about
Ramirez some other time, ok?\e"
MQ0040047,"\h(《Doc》)Sure thing. And don't forget to bring more
Moonfish!\e"
MQ0050000,\h(《Maria》)Thank you for always bringing fish for me...\e
MQ0050001,\h(《Maria》)Look how much Picollo has grown!\e
MQ0050002,"\h(《Vyse》)Whoa... And to think he used to be small enough
to fit in the palm of your hand!\e"
MQ0050003,"\h(《Doc》)Tell me about it. Who'd have thought that it
would grow this big.\e"
MQ0050004,"\h(《Maria》)Picollo, let's go play over there!\e"
MQ0050005,\h(《Picollo》)Chirp!\e
MQ0050006,"\h(《Doc》)Maria, be careful! If that big guy starts
running around, this rickety old ship won't hold
together long!\e"
MQ0050007,"\h(《Maria》)I know!
Picollo, come on! Over here!\e"
MQ0050008,"\h(《Doc》)I just wanted to thank you, Vyse. Because of you
and your crew, Maria has finally come out of her
shell. She's become herself again.\e"
MQ0050009,"\h(《Doc》)In return... well, that's a strange way to put
it, but in return, I'll tell you the rest of my
story.\e"
MQ0050010,"\h(《Doc》)It's hard... for me to talk about it. But, if
Maria can be strong enough to get over her
past...\e"
MQ0050011,"\h(《Doc》)...I can't sit here and dwell on my past,
either. I guess I've finally become strong
enough to realize that.\e"
MQ0050012,\h(《Vyse》)Doc...\e
MQ0050013,"\h(《Doc》)Well, if you must know, then I'll tell you. I'll
tell you of the tragedy that befell Ramirez...\e"
MQ0050014,"\h(《Doc》)“Depend on a person too much and they will
betray your trust sooner or later.” Or so
Galcian told Ramirez.\e"
MQ0050015,"\h(《Doc》)Maybe that hit a little close to home... I don't
know. But for whatever reason, Ramirez began to
snoop around for information regarding Mendosa.\e"
MQ0050016,"\h(《Doc》)And that's when we found out that... That
Mendosa was using the Ixa'takans as slaves for
his own personal profit.\e"
MQ0050017,"\h(《Doc》)He forced the Ixa'takans to work a few extra
hours here and there, and pocketed all the extra
Moonstones that they found for himself.\e"
MQ0050018,"\h(《Doc》)The shock of this discovery was almost too much
for Ramirez to bear. He went directly to Admiral
Mendosa and confronted him...\e"
MQ0050019,"\h(《Ramirez》)M'lord!
Is... is it true? Is it true about the
Moonstones?! And the Ixa'takan slaves?!\e"
MQ0050020,"\h(《Mendosa》)I won't lie to you. Yes, it is true. But, what's
the problem? Is there something wrong with
making money? With desiring wealth and power?\e"
MQ0050021,"\h(《Ramirez》)You are forcing the Ixa'takans to work grueling
hours in inhumane conditions!\e"
MQ0050022,"\h(《Ramirez》)M'lord, you promised me... You told me that you
would speak to Her Majesty in regards to the
way the Ixa'takans were being treated!\e"
MQ0050023,"\h(《Mendosa》)Hahaha... You truly are naive, aren't you? And
what exactly do you think would have happened if
I did that?\e"
MQ0050024,"\h(《Mendosa》)Her Majesty would find out about my little
scheme, and I would basically be signing my own
death warrant.\e"
MQ0050025,\h(《Ramirez》)How... how could you lie to me like that?!\e
MQ0050026,"\h(《Mendosa》)It is quite unfortunate that things had to turn
out this way, Ramirez. And to think I thought of
you as a son...\e"
MQ0050027,"\h(《Mendosa》)Regardless, you have uncovered my plans and have
left me with no choice. Guards! Seize him!\e"
MQ0050028,\h(《Ramirez》)Everything... All that I have believed in...\e
MQ0050029,\h(《Ramirez》)Aaaaaaaarrgh!\e
MQ0050030,"\h(《Doc》)By the time I got there, it was already too
late.\e"
MQ0050031,"\h(《Doc》)The guards... even Admiral Mendosa... they had
all fallen under Ramirez's blade.\e"
MQ0050032,"\h(《Doc》)Ramirez!!
What... what have you done?!\e"
MQ0050033,"\h(《Ramirez》)I... I'm sorry, Doc.\e"
MQ0050034,"\h(《Ramirez》)But, I can no longer trust humans. I can no
longer remain here.\e"
MQ0050035,"\h(《Doc》)Wait! Ramirez!
Where are you going?!\e"
MQ0050036,"\h(《Ramirez》)Goodbye, Doc. The Ramirez that you knew is no
more. He died the moment I drew my blade against
Admiral Mendosa.\e"
MQ0050037,"\h(《Ramirez》)From now on, I will only believe in strength. I
shall only follow those with power.\e"
MQ0050038,\h(《Doc》)Wait!!! Ramirez! Ramireeeeez!!!\e
MQ0050039,"\h(《Doc》)...And so, Ramirez went to Galcian's side, and I
believe you know the rest of the story.\e"
MQ0050040,"\h(《Doc》)I had spent so much time with both Mendosa and
Ramirez, and yet I could do nothing to stop this
tragedy from happening.\e"
MQ0050041,"\h(《Doc》)If I only had the strength to stop him, Mendosa,
Ramirez, and even Maria... all of their lives
would have turned out so much differently.\e"
MQ0050042,\h(《Vyse》)Doc...\e
MQ0050043,"\h(《Doc》)I know, I know. I'm going to stop living in the
past. Just gotta keep looking forward and hope
for the best!\e"
MQ0050044,"\h(《Doc》)And besides, I think it's a blessing that I was
able to save Maria from the burning wreckage of
the Aquila...\e"
MQ0050045,"\h(《Doc》)But, I heard that some Air Pirates that were
passing through the area helped save most of the
crew after we left, though.\e"
MQ0050046,\h(《Fina》)Aquila... That name...\e
MQ0050047,"\h(《Aika》)W, wait a second there, Fina. You don't
think...?\e"
MQ0050048,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, Doc... Maria wouldn't happen to have an
older sister, would she?\e"
MQ0050049,"\h(《Doc》)Actually, she did. Wait, did I forget to tell
you that?\e"
MQ0050050,"\h(《Doc》)Well, unfortunately, she went missing after the
accident. Nobody knows what happened to her.
Poor Piastol...\e"
MQ0050051,"\h(《Doc》)It's bothered me for years that I couldn't save
both of them...\e"
MQ0050052,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse, then it is her!\e"
MQ0050053,"\h(《Vyse》)There's no doubt about it. Maria and Piastol are
long-lost sisters.\e"
MQ0050054,\h(《Aika》)We gotta tell Piastol!!!\e
MQ0050055,"\h(《Vyse》)Piastol said that she would come to fight us
again sometime.\e"
MQ0050056,"\h(《Vyse》)When we see her, we'll tell her everything we
know. What she does with this information is up
to her.\c"
MQ0060000,\h(《Vyse》)Wow! He just keeps getting bigger and bigger!\e
MQ0060001,"\h(《Aika》)Well, I think if anything ate that many Moon
Fish, it'd grow at least half as much...\e"
MQ0060002,"\h(《Aika》)But I bet that Maria's real happy that he's
grown so much! Huh, Doc?\e"
MQ0060003,"\h(《Doc》)...You'd think so, but life doesn't always turn
out the way you expect.\e"
MQ0060004,"\h(《Maria》)Picollo...
He wants to go home.\e"
MQ0060005,\h(《Vyse》)Huh?\e
MQ0060006,"\h(《Maria》)Picollo has grown wings... so now he's saying he
wants to go home... Home to where all his
friends are.\e"
MQ0060007,"\h(《Doc》)I think he has a point, though. If we don't
return him to nature, he'll never find any of
his own kind, let alone find someone to marry.\e"
MQ0060008,"\h(《Doc》)But the one thing that's keeping me worried is
if this guy leaves, Maria's going to fall into
depression again.\e"
MQ0060009,"\h(《Maria》)Uncle Doc, I... I'll be fine.\e"
MQ0060010,"\h(《Doc》)M, Maria??\e"
MQ0060011,"\h(《Maria》)Ever since Daddy and my sister... went away,
I've been so lonely.\e"
MQ0060012,"\h(《Maria》)And I think that Picollo feels lonely, too.\e"
MQ0060013,"\h(《Maria》)I'm going to miss him, but I think he should go
home so he won't be lonely anymore.\e"
MQ0060014,"\h(《Maria》)I have you and Vyse to take care of me, too! I
don't have to be lonely anymore!\e"
MQ0060015,"\h(《Vyse》)Well! You sure have grown, Maria!\e"
MQ0060016,\h(《Doc》)Vyse... I don't know how to thank you...\e
MQ0060017,"\h(《Doc》)To think this is the same Maria that I've been
caring for all these years... I can't believe
it. I owe everything to you.\e"
MQ0060018,\h(《Vyse》)Hey! Looks like he's getting ready to leave!\e
MQ0060019,"\h(《Aika》)Sorta reminds ya of when we left Pirate Isle, eh
Vyse?\e"
MQ0060020,"\h(《Maria》)Good-bye, Picollo! Be nice to your new friends!
And come back to see me sometime!\e"
MQ0070000,\h(《Maria》)Oh hey! It's Vyse!\e
MQ0070001,"\h(《Doc》)Thanks for stopping by. I don't have much to
offer in the way of comforts, but you're free to
stay as long as you wish.\e"
MQ0070002,"\h(《Doc》)Oh, hey... I almost forgot to tell you
something. Piastol came by the other day.\e"
MQ0070003,"\h(《Vyse》)R, really?!\e"
MQ0070004,\h(《Doc》)Yep... It was a day I'll never forget.\e
MQ0070005,"\h(《Piastol》)E, excuse me...\e"
MQ0070006,"\h(《Maria》)Um...
Are you one of Uncle Doc's patients?\e"
MQ0070007,"\h(《Piastol》)Heh, no...\eNothing like that.\e"
MQ0070008,"\h(《Piastol》)I was... uh... just passing by and thought I'd
drop in.\e"
MQ0070009,\h(《Maria》)Oh... I see.\e
MQ0070010,"\h(《Piastol》)Were you... looking for something out there? I
saw you staring out at the sky.\e"
MQ0070011,"\h(《Maria》)Yeah. My friend, Picollo, is out there
somewhere. I was just wondering how he was
doing.\e"
MQ0070012,"\h(《Maria》)Picollo used to live here, but he flew home to
be with his friends. He's a bird, you know.\e"
MQ0070013,\h(《Piastol》)I see... It must be lonely for you without him.\e
MQ0070014,\h(《Maria》)...Yeah.\e
MQ0070015,"\h(《Maria》)Picollo and I are like each other. We both were
so lonely... with no other friends.\e"
MQ0070016,"\h(《Maria》)But, he grew up and was able to go see his
friends.\e"
MQ0070017,\h(《Piastol》)......\e
MQ0070018,"\h(《Maria》)But, Uncle Doc told me something. He told me
that I have a big sister.\e"
MQ0070019,"\h(《Maria》)And that my big sister is out there, somewhere,
flying through the skies. I wonder if I'll ever
get to meet her?\e"
MQ0070020,"\h(《Piastol》)Y, yeah...\e"
MQ0070021,"\h(《Piastol》)I, I'm sure you will. Someday, you will. I just
know it.\e"
MQ0070022,\h(《Maria》)Really?? You think so! Wow...\e
MQ0070023,"\h(《Piastol》)...Would it be ok if I came back? You know, to
talk with you again?\e"
MQ0070024,\h(《Maria》)Of course!\e
MQ0070025,"\h(《Piastol》)...Thank you. You don't know how much that means
to me.\e"
MQ0070026,"\h(《Doc》)I think she wants to get to know her little by
little. To ease back into things. Someday, they
will be family again.\e"
MQ0070027,"\h(《Doc》)Vyse... I've heard about you and Ramirez from
various rumors from sailors passing through.\e"
MQ0070028,"\h(《Doc》)One of you, either you or Ramirez, will not walk
away alive from this mess. Which means I will
lose one of my dear friends, either way.\e"
MQ0070029,\h(《Vyse》)Doc...\e
MQ0070030,"\h(《Doc》)Vyse, just follow your instincts. Just do what
you have to. I know you're sailing the path that
you feel is right.\e"
MQ0070031,"\h(《Doc》)I get the feeling that deep down inside, Ramirez
is doing the same.\e"
MQ0070032,"\h(《Doc》)...Good luck, Vyse.\e"
MQ0070033,\h(《Vyse》)...Thanks.\e
M91140000,"\h(《Doc》)I see you've caught some Moonfish.
Here, let's feed the little critter.\e"
M91140001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Feed the bird a Moonfish.”
“Return to your ship.”\e"
M91140002,\h(　)You gave the “Moonfish” to Maria's bird.\c
M91140003,"\h(《Doc》)Well, be sure to go out there and catch more
Moonfish for Maria's little friend!\c"
M91140004,\h(《Aika》)Hmm... That thing is getting... big.\e
M91140005,\h(《Vyse》)Geez. I wonder how much more it'll grow??\c
M91140007,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! Vyse, look! Something's different
about him!!\e"
M91140008,\h(《Vyse》)What's wrong??\e
M91140009,\h(《Aika》)I dunno... He looks different for some reason.\e
M91140010,"\h(《Doc》)I don't know why or how, but it looks
like every time he grows, his body changes
in other ways, too.\c"
M91140006,"\h(《Aika》)Eew. It coughed up something. Oh wait, there's
something inside the... um... hairball.\e"
M91140011,"\h(《Doc》)Tell ya what... As a token of my appreciation,
you can keep whatever the bird spits up. Ok?\c"
M91140012,"\h(《Doc》)Looks like you've still got some Moonfish
left over. Do you want to feed another one
to the bird?\e"
M91140013,"\h(《Doc》)Thanks for stopping by! But, unfortunately,
I'm about to head out on a house call. I'm
afraid you're gonna have to come back later.\e"

their Armada is unstoppable. Let them try to get
past us.\e"
M81210001,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)It doesn't matter how many ships they have. If
they try to rush through the strait, we'll just
pick them off.\c"
M90010000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)This region of the sky is like a giant maze.
There are sky rifts and islands all over the
place.\e"
M90010001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)We need to be careful around here. There are
lots of spots where Air Pirates can hide and
ambush us.\c"
M90010002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Shrine Island? Forget it. No one in their right
mind would go near the place.\e"
M90010003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I've heard that there are monsters on that
island, and if you fly close enough, you can
hear them at night when the winds are still.\c"
M90010004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)It was incredible! I heard this really loud
rumble, and my ship started shaking. I looked
over the side…\e"
M90010005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)… I saw a whole fleet of Valuan warships. I
wonder where they were going. With a fleet that
large, they must have been attacking someone.\c"
M90010006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you're looking for Sailors' Island, it's
northeast of here. Just look for the
lighthouse… it'll guide you to the port.\e"
M90010007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You'll see it right after you go through the
rock tunnel.\c"
M90010008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)From what I hear, Valua has added another
admiral to it's ranks. That makes six main
fleets in the Armada now.\e"
M90010009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)With that many ships, they must be up to
something. I wouldn't want to get on their bad
side.\c"
M90010010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Where'd you get that ship?! I've never seen a
ship like that before!\e"
M90010011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Wait a second… That's a Valuan Ship! You stole
it!!! You're either very brave… or very
stupid!\c"
M90010012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Is that right? There's really a land called
Yafutoma in the far east?\e"
M90010013,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)What?! You say you can reach Yafutoma by going
west, too? Wait… I don't get it…\c"
M90010014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe it… Valua has been completely
destroyed. You can still smell the smoke at 100
leagues, if you're downwind.\c"
M90020000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Say, you must be members of the infamous Dyne
Clan. We've been hearing a lot about you guys
lately!\e"
M90020001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)We hear you've been really stirring things up
over in Valua. Keep up the good work.
We're behind you all the way.\c"
M90020002,\h(《Merchant Ship》)I saw a Moon Stone hit Shrine Island yesterday.\e
M90020003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That stone is as good as gone. You'd have to be
crazy to go after it. Shrine Island is haunted,
you know.\c"
M90020004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You're going to Valua? Just head north from
here. It should be easy to find. But, you'll
need a passport to get in.\e"
M90020005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Passports are usually only issued to a very
small number of merchants who are permitted to
trade with Valua.\c"
M90020006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I just heard that the Ship Parts Merchant in
Sailors' Island just got in a shipment of
Secondary Cannons.\e"
M90020007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)All of the stores in Sailors' Island get regular
shipments of new goods every now and then. You
should check back there often.\c"
M90020008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)A Valuan ship! Please spare me! I have done
nothing wrong! I have a family to feed!!\e"
M90020009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)What? You're Air Pirates? Heh… You scared me
there for a second. But wait… I suppose I
should still be scared, huh?\c"
M90020010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You said you sailed around the world? Ha! Yeah,
right! What kind of fool do you take me for?
Everyone knows the world is flat!\c"
M90020011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That massive island came up from Deep Sky and
now the sky rifts are gone!\e"
M90020012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I wonder if the sky rifts were formed when the
island sank into Deep Sky in the first place.\c"
M90020013,\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe that island rose from Deep Sky!\e
M90020014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Think of the impact that it's going to have on
all of the trade routes.\c"
M90200000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)This region is called Mid Ocean. All of the
trade routes pass through here.\e"
M90200001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That's Sailors' Island, over there. It's in the
middle of all of the trade routes, so it's a
great place to gather information.\c"
M90200002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Wow! That's an impressive weapon you have there.
Hey, is that a Harpoon Cannon? I've heard those
things can blast through stone reefs!\e"
M90200003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you pass through that stone reef, and
continue west, you'll see Nasr. You'll know
you're there when you see a huge desert.\c"
M90200004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Have you heard? They say that Nasrad, the
capital of Nasr, has been destroyed.\e"
M90200005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)An Admiral named Ramirez leveled the place. Some
of the merchants are helping the refugees.\c"
M90200006,\h(《Merchant Ship》)They've reopened the route to Cape Victory!\e
M90200007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Now that engineers are developing engines that
can power through sky rifts, it's even safe to
go to Esparanza now!\e"
M90200008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)A few advances in technology can really change
the world.\c"
M90200009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I heard a rumble, then there were some strong
gusts of wind. I was trying to keep control of
my ship, and that island came out of nowhere!\e"
M90200010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Some merchants see this as an opportunity to
make a profit, but not me! I'm more concerned
with staying alive!\c"
M90200011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You guys are amazing! You actually defeated the
Valuan Armada! I can't believe it!\e"
M90200012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)But the Valuans still have a base on that huge
island! I hope you can send that thing back into
Deep Sky where it belongs!\c"
M91200000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Just recently, trade routes have been
established in North Ocean!\e"
M91200001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I heard that Gordo, the Air Pirate, actually
opened a restaurant out there, and I heard
that the food is really good, too!\c"
M91200002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I'm not about to let that new continent scare me
away! Trade has been better than ever, lately.\e"
M91200003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I know Air Pirates spend all their time going
after treasure, but we have to make an honest
living.\c"
M90210000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you head due north from here, you'll run into
Valua.\e"
M90210001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Be careful, they won't let you in without a
Valuan Passport. And forget about sneaking
in, there are patrols all over the place.\c"
M90210002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You guys are pirates, aren't you? If you are,
I'd stay clear of Valua. If they catch you,
you're as good as dead.\e"
M90210003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Valua has strict laws against piracy. If they
even think you're a pirate, they bring you to
the Coliseum and execute you.\c"
M90210004,\h(《Merchant Ship》)Did you hear what happened in Valua?\e
M90210005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)There's rumors that someone actually broke out
of the Grand Fortress. I'd like to meet that
guy, and shake his hand.\c"
M90210006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I've seen a lot of Valuan construction ships in
the area. They must be working on something
pretty big.\c"
M90210007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Hey, did you hear? Valua is constructing a new
base. They are building it on Dangral Island.\e"
M90210008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)None of our ships can fly low enough to get a
good look at it, but there's been lots of
construction ships in the area.\e"
M90210009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)With that ship of yours, you might be able to
see what's going on. Go south and and start
searching under the clouds. You can't miss it.\c"
M90210010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You should be able to see the base, if you fly
south from here and search under the clouds.\c"
M90210011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)There's been a lot of Valuan ships around here
lately, so we figured that they were up to
something…\e"
M90210012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)But I never would have guessed that they were
capable of raising an entire continent out of
Deep Sky.\c"
M90210013,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe it! You guys were amazing! I
never thought I'd see all of the Air Pirates
join forces and attack the Armada head on.\e"
M90210014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)By winning that battle, you guys changed the 
course of the world! Who knows what would 
have happened if the Armada had won?\c"
M90050000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Welcome to Nasr, the desert kingdom!\e"
M90050001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)There's a port called Maramba nearby. Your ship
looks like it's been through quite a bit. Maybe
you should restock your supplies there.\c"
M90050002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)It looks like your ship is from Nasr, but you
don't look Nasrean. I should warn you…\e"
M90050003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)With a ship that small, you would never make it
through the stone reefs that surround our
beautiful desert. You should turn back.\c"
M90050004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you go southwest from here, you'll reach
South Ocean, there are some really strong
headwinds there, so be careful.\e"
M90050005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)It is uncharted territory… no one has ever made
it through South Ocean before, although many
have tried.\c"

southern tip of Nasr.\e"
M90050007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you want to go there, although I can't
imagine why anyone would go there, you'll have
to fly through a sky rift. Good luck trying…\c"
M90050008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Items from the newly discovered continent have
already begun to make their way into the
marketplaces of the rest of the world.\e"

there are goods to trade, merchants like us
will survive.\c"
M90050010,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Soltis… Yes, I've heard that name before. It
was the name of an ancient civilization.
Some of our historians have records of it.\e"

pushed the entire continent into Deep Sky.\c"

M90060001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)My primary trade is in carpets and Red Moon
Stones.\c"
M90060002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)During ship battles, sometimes your gunners will
lose sight of their targets. Any gunner worth
his salt will shout “Lost” when this happens.\e"
M90060003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)This often happens when your opponent gets
behind you in the heat of battle.\c"

and destroyed the city!\e"
M90060005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I'll bet they burned my shop to the ground, too.
Damn Valuans!\c"
M90060006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)My shop in Nasrad is gone… destroyed in the
attack. I have no idea what I'm going to do

world too.\e"
M90060008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Please… I know who you are… I've heard of
tales of your bravery… I beg you. Please… stop
them. You're the only one who can.\c"
M91060000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Welcome to Nasrad, the capital of our kingdom!\e"
M91060001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)We have riches beyond your wildest dreams…
We are truly blessed by the Red Moon.
Enjoy your stay…\c"
M91060002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Your ship is able to fly beneath the clouds, I'm
sure you've seen some amazing things.\e"
M91060003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I bet there're strange creatures and sunken
ships down there, eh?\e"
M90220002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)The Nasr fleet protects our trade routes from
Black Pirates. That's why Nasr is so profitable.
Everyone trades with us, because it's safe.\c"
M90220003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)The capitol of Nasr, may have been
destroyed, but not the spirit of the Nasr
people. They've already started rebuilding.\e"
M90220004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I know that a new city will rise from the ashes
of the old.\c"
M90230000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you keep heading south, you'll run into South
Ocean. Traveling through there is almost
impossible.\e"
M90230001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)There are some really strong headwinds there…
Most ships can't handle it. It's best to
avoid that area completely.\c"
M90230002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What?!
You're really going to try to cross South Ocean?
But, no one has ever crossed it before!!\e"
M90230003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What is it with young people these days?
You could get killed! Well, don't say I didn't
warn you.\c"
M90230004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What?! You mean to tell me that you crossed
South Ocean and discovered a new continent?\e"
M90230005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Hmm… If that's true, it might be possible to
start a new trade route through South Ocean.\c"
M90230006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)We tried to set up a trade route with the new
continent through South Ocean, but the headwinds
were too strong.\e"
M90230007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Trade routes have opened in North Ocean, but
that doesn't help us here in the South.\c"
M90230008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I don't know if it has anything to do with the
appearance of that huge island, but the
skies of South Ocean are calm.\e"
M90230009,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Once the war is over, I may be able to open up
that trade route to the new continent like I've
been wanting to.\e"
M90230010,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I'm counting on you, Vyse! It's entirely on your
shoulders! Think of the possibilities! Think of
the money!\c"
M90150000,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I don't think I've ever seen a ship like that
around here before. I'll bet it's a Moon Stone
Trader coming to dig up Yellow Moon Stones.\e"
M90150001,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Just so you know, the Moon Stones in this area
have already been mined, so there's hardly any
left.\e"
M90150002,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Valua is trying to expand because we need to
find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"
M90150003,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Valua is trying to expand because we need to
find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"
M90150004,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Ah, protecting us from Air Pirates… Good. It's
always nice to see that the Valuan Armada is
looking out for us.\e"
M90150005,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I've heard that there's an Air Pirate named Vyse
who thinks he can outwit the Armada. I hope you
catch him!\c"
M90150006,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)It's shocking news! Lord Galcian has rebelled
against Empress Teodora!\e"
M90150007,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I, I never would have imagined that our glorious
empire would errupt into civil war! I wonder
what Lord Galcian is after…\c"
M90150008,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I couldn't believe my eyes. Moon Stones were
falling on Valua… like rain!\e"
M90150009,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)When the rain stopped, there was nothing left…
Valua has been destroyed.\c"
M90160000,\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Shhh! Hey kid… I got some Valuan arms here…\e
M90160001,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)I also buy and sell Discovery information.
I've got everything you need…\c"
M90160002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Buy and sell Discovery information.”
“Leave.”\e"
M90160003,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Valua discovered Ixa'taka several years ago and
immediately conquered it.\e"
M90160004,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Today it is a colony of Valua. The people of
Ixa'taka have been put to work as slaves in
order to get Moon Stones.\c"
M90160005,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this
region, and the Ixa'takans don't have a need for
ship parts…\e"
M90160006,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)I really don't know how much longer I'll be able
to stay in business. Maybe it's time to look for
a new line of work…\c"
M90160008,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)You've heard of Domingo, right… He's one of
the greatest explorers of our time.\e"
M90160009,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)If you're hunting for treasure in this area,
good luck. It's not easy finding anything that
Domingo hasn't already discovered.\e"
M90160010,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Last time I saw him, he said he was searching
for the “Ixa'taka Palace.”\e"
M90160011,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this
region, and the Ixa'takans don't have a need for
ship parts…\e"

to stay in business. Maybe it's time to look for
a new line of work…\c"
M90160007,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)I'm always flying around this area, so if you're
ever around, feel free to stop by.\c"
M90280000,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)North Ocean is a vital trade route that brings a
wealth of new goods from the new continent back
to Valua.\e"
M90280001,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Unfortunately, where there's gold to be made,
there's always pirates that want to steal it.
Be careful!\c"
M90280002,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Admirals Belleza and Vigoro took their fleets to
do battle in the west just a little while ago…\e"
M90280003,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Both fleets suffered heavy losses. I wonder what
happened to them?\c"
M90280004,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Just recently, other merchants have begun
trading with the new continent, and Valua's
losing control over the trade routes.\e"
M90280005,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I've also heard that there's dissention in
the Royal Palace, too.\c"
M90280006,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Our capital has been destroyed. Our glorious
reign of Valuan supremacy appears to be at an
end.\c"
M90290000,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)What do you think of my new ship? Just look at
the shine on this baby! Its new engine is even
capable of punching through sky rifts.\e"
M90290001,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)With ships like this, we'll be able to establish
a trade route running from Maramba to Esparanza!\c"
M90290002,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)The other day when I was flying near the Dark
Rift, I was attacked by a creature the size of
an island.\e"
M90290003,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I barely managed to escape with my life… I
couldn't believe how big it was… It was the
scariest thing I've ever seen!\c"
M90070000,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Your ship is very different.
Are you from the West?\e"
M90070001,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)These lands are blessed by the Green Moon.
It is called Ixa'taka.
The forest is our home.\c"
M90070002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Our people eat berries and seeds. We really like
to eat “Sky Sardis” but they are harder to
catch than berries and seeds.\e"
M90070003,\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Can you please bring me 10 “Sky Sardis?”\c
M90070004,"\h(《Vyse》)If you want “Sky Sardis,” I have 10 right
here! You can have them, if you want.\e"
M90070005,"\h(　)You give 10 “Sky Sardis” to the captain of the
ship.\e"
M90070006,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Chomp chomp chomp…
Yum! I love fish!\e"
M90070007,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)I'd eat them every day, but they're too hard to
catch.\e"
M90070008,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Thank you. I am very grateful.
Take this as a symbol of my appreciation.\e"
M90070009,\h(　)You received 1 “Abirik Cham.”\c
M90070010,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The “Sky Sardis” were very good.
But, I got a bone stuck in my throat! I guess I
ate them too fast.\c"
M90080000,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Our ships have wings, but they also need
Moon Stones for fuel.\e"
M90080001,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The Valuan ships breathe fire.
We are no match for them.\c"
M90080002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)A Great Bird spreads its wings… I once heard
this story, a long time ago.\e"
M90080003,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Somewhere near the northern lake, they say
there's a Great Bird that's visible only from
the sky.\c"
M90080004,\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The Valuans left Moon Stone Mountain.\e
M90080005,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The people that were taken hostage returned to
Horteka. I'm so glad that they're all safe.\c"
M90080006,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Many, many Valuan ships came. The ship with the
big firestick blew a hole in the western stone
reef.\e"
M90080007,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)But then, your ship appeared through that hole.
Where did you come from?\c"
M90080008,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)There's a hole at the end of the world. It's big
and scary. I'm going to stay away from it.\e"
M90080009,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The other day, I went near the hole. Another
ship came out. All of the people on it had black
hair. I was scared.\c"
M90240000,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)We've been hiding, but with the Valuans gone,
we can fly our ships again.\e"
M90240001,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The Valuans left through the iron wall across
the northern valley and flew away. I think you
can get to Valua from there.\c"
M90240002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Many Valuan ships came. I was afraid and hid
from them. They flew past me, to the west
of here.\e"
M90240003,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)After a while, the ships came back. There was
lots of smoke on the ships. I wonder what
happened…\c"
M90240004,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)I heard a scary noise coming from the eastern
skies. I wonder what it was…\c"
M90250000,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)I live apart from the rest of the world in this
quiet place, making my home with the flowers
and the insects.\e"
M90250001,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)I'm grateful that you took the trouble to visit
me here, so let me tell you a little secret.\e"
M90250002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a
wonderful flower called the “Balloon Flower.”
It's very beautiful.\e"
M90250003,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)You will also find a huge flock of insects that
flutter in the wind if you travel to the land
where Ixa'taka meets the Land of the Red Moon.\e"
M90250004,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)… Travel high in the sky to find
“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90250005,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a

“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90110000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I'm a fisherman. I've been chasing after a fish
called “Hamahai” for a long time.\e"
M90110001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)This fish called “Hamahai” is a really rare
species that's found only in the skies high
above Yafutoma.\e"
M90110002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)They fetch a great price, of course. If you have
the time, you might want to see if you can snag
some.\c"
M90120000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Who are you guys anyway? And how do you manage
to stay in the air with those steel ships of
yours?\e"
M90120001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I know who you are! You're Westerners! I've read
about people from the West, but you're the first
Westerners that I've actually seen!\e"
M90120002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Thanks to Prince Daigo, the Tenkou fleet has now
been recognized as an official part of the
Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120003,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)They don't have to stay in the ranks either.
Because they're Air Pirates, they're better at
guerilla tactics and boarding enemy ships!\c"
M90120004,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Prince Daigo already set sail towards the west
with the rest of the Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120005,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I think Yafutoma is better off with Prince Daigo
as a Naval Commander. It was a mistake to exile
him in the first place.\c"
M90260000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Mount Kazai is our most impressive landmark. I
doubt any ships from the west would be able to
sail over it.\c"
M90260001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)What?! You're telling me that your ship can sail
over Mount Kazai?!\e"
M90260002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Well, I'm really impressed. My compliments
to your engineers.\c"
M90270000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Beyond the eastern sky, there is a stone reef. I
found a hole in it, but I've been too scared to
fly close to it.\e"
M90270001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)The other day, I finally got the courage to go
near it, but I saw someone in a strange-looking
ship, wearing a mask, so I flew away.\c"
M90750000,"\h(《Gordo》)There haven't been any fish around here since
that new island came out of Deep Sky.\e"
M90750001,"\h(《Gordo》)Anyone who takes food away from me will pay
dearly. Vyse, I hope you destroy them…\c"
M90750002,"\h(《Gordo》)What was that? 
You're looking for Gentum, Khale, and Kabal?\e"
M90750003,"\h(《Gordo》)I see… well, it looks like you are searching
for some exotic ingredients.\e"
M90750004,"\h(《Gordo》)Fortunately, we serve Kabal here in my
restaurant. I'd be more than happy to give
you some.\e"
M90750005,"\h(《Gordo》)It's always best to marinade it for a day or two
before cooking it… that's when all the flavors
start to come out. Good Kabal is very rare…\e"
M90750006,\h(　)You received “Kabal.”\e
M90750007,"\h(《Gordo》)Well then…
You're still looking for the other 2
ingredients, right?\e"
M90750008,"\h(《Gordo》)Hmm… It's a commonly used spice over in Nasr,
and it's easily recognizable by its scent.\e"
M90750009,"\h(《Gordo》)I'd be surprised if you couldn't find any in
Nasrad. After all, it is the largest trade city
in the world.\e"
M90750010,"\h(《Gordo》)And what else were you looking for? Ah yes…
Khale. The “Spice of Dreams” as it is sometimes
called.\e"
M90750011,"\h(《Gordo》)Not only does it spice up food, it actually
enhances the flavor of it as well.\e"
M90750012,"\h(《Gordo》)But, I have heard rumors that the last of the
Khale Trees burned down in the Valua - Nasr
War.\e"
M90750013,"\h(《Gordo》)In the Far East, there is an island that is made
up entirely of spices. If you can find that
island, you may be in luck.\c"
M90750014,"\h(《Gordo》)I think you'll be able to find “Gentum” in
Nasrad.\e"
M90750015,"\h(《Gordo》)If you're looking for “Khale”, there may be some
on Spice Island in the Far East.\c"
M90750016,"\h(《Gordo》)Well, well… I see that the information that I
gave you on Gentum and Khale was helpful.\e"
M90750017,"\h(《Gordo》)If you ever have any more questions concerning
exotic ingredients, I'll be able to help. I'm
not called the Gourmet Pirate for nothing.\c"
M90760000,"\h(《Daigo》)Well, Vyse, this is it. The rest of us will be
watching your back from up here. Go Vyse, you're
the only one that can do this.\c"
M90760001,\h(《Jao》)We pray…\e
M90760002,\h(《Mao》)… for your victory.\c

Hans, with you?\e"
M90780003,"\h(《Centime》)He looks up to you quite a bit. And even though
he's already very skilled at engineering, I
think it would be great training for him.\e"
M90780004,"\h(《Centime》)I think it is time for him to go off on his own
and make his mark in the world.\e"
M90780005,"\h(《Hans》)Vyse, take me with you! I'll do my best to be
of service!\e"

Doesn't Centime need you to work on his ship?\e"
M90780011,"\h(《Centime》)Don't worry about me, Vyse. I'm quite an
accomplished engineer myself. I've taught him
all that I can.\e"
M90780012,"\h(《Hans》)My father has trained me well! But I know there
is probably much more that I can learn by
working on your ship! Please!\e"
M90780013,"\h(《Vyse》)I see…
Alright, then. I'll take you with me.\e"
M90780014,\h(《Hans》)Thank you so much!\e

the Delphinus… And do what Captain Vyse tells
you to do.\e"
M90780001,"\h(《Hans》)Sure, Dad. You've taught me well, and I always
follow orders. I'll do everything I can to help
Captain Vyse.\c"

come back to me!\e"
M91160000,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, on the Albatross, you always did your
best. You were always the first to board an
enemy ship, and nobody could stop you.\e"
M91160001,"\h(《Dyne》)I've always been proud of you. Maybe there were
times when I didn't show it, but I've never been
disappointed in you.\e"
M91160002,"\h(《Dyne》)Now, this is it. We've got the enemy cornered.
Don't give up, Vyse! I know you can do it!\c"

Understand?! I want you to know I won't stand

clowns. Got that?! I'm the one who gets to kill
you! Me!\c"

Slow to half speed…\e"

over there!\e"

There's nothing but open sky over there.\e"
M09903001,"\h(《Dyne》)Turn around and head back to Pirate Isle. This
is no time for you to be fooling around.\c"
M09903002,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, Vyse! You're heading the wrong way! Did you
forget how to read a compass or something?\e"
M09903003,"\h(《Aika》)Shrine Island is to the southwest of here!
That's when the little needle thingy is between

Pirate Isle!\c"

haunted.\e"

M09906001,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M09906002,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M09908000,"\h(《Drachma》)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908001,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully made it
through there.\e"
M09908002,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
Sounds like fun. Let's give it a shot.\e"
M09908003,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot! Don't take it so lightly! If it was that
easy, I wouldn't be warnin' you like this!\e"
M09908004,"\h(《Drachma》)Small ships are torn apart by the fierce winds.
Even large ships need considerable power to just
move forward.\e"
M09908005,"\h(《Drachma》)The Little Jack's engine isn't strong enough to
get through here. We must turn back.\c"
M09908006,"\h(《Drachma》)This is South Ocean, boy. I thought I told you
that we'd never make it through there alive.
Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908007,"\h(《Bellena》)The area before you is called South Ocean. I'd
turn back if I were you.\e"
M09908008,"\h(《Bellena》)There's a strong wind that blows from the west
here. This place is known among sailors as one
of the most difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908009,"\h(《Bellena》)Nobody has ever made it through this place. And
nobody knows what lies on the other side,
either.\e"
M09908010,"\h(《Aika》)Wow…
I suppose we'd never make it through in this
tiny ship.\e"
M09908011,"\h(《Bellena》)This ship would probably be torn apart instantly
in the fierce winds.\e"
M09908012,"\h(《Bellena》)We would need a much, much more powerful engine
even to have a chance of making it through
there.\e"
M09908013,"\h(《Aika》)You're probably right. And besides… we should
be looking for the Red Moon Crystal right now,
anyway. Alright Vyse! Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908014,"\h(《Bellena》)I told you that this is South Ocean. We'd never
make it through there. Turn the boat around.\c"
M09908015,"\h(《Drachma》)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908016,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully sailed
through it.\e"
M09908017,"\h(《Vyse》)But the lands of the Green Moon are through
here, right?\e"
M09908018,"\h(《Vyse》)And besides, we have Belleza's engine now.
It's not like we don't have a chance of making
it through.\e"
M09908019,"\h(《Drachma》)Hmm…
Perhaps. But my knowledge of this place is
limited. You're on your own, boy.\e"
M09908020,"\h(《Drachma》)This isn't goin' to be an easy journey. Prepare
yourselves for the worst, kids.\c"
M09909910,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse! This is it! This is where the Red Moon
Crystal is buried!\e"
M09909911,"\h(《Vyse》)Great! Let's land this ship and search the place
right away!\e"
M09909912,\h(《Drachma》)……\e
M09909913,"\h(《Drachma》)… Wait, boy.
Head to town first. I've got some things that I
need to take care of.\e"
M09909914,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a port city named Maramba near here.
Go there first, got it?\e"
M09909915,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… sure. No problem. I just thought that we
could… um… never mind. It doesn't matter to
me.\c"
M09909916,"\h(《Drachma》)You can explore the temple later. Head to
Maramba first, boy.\c"
M09901100,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrumph…
So this is the Iron Net. I've heard rumors about
it.\e"
M09901101,"\h(《Drachma》)I heard that the Valuans built this to prevent
people from coming here from North Ocean.\e"
M09901102,"\h(《Drachma》)I guess they didn't want anyone to find out
about this new land.\e"
M09901103,"\h(《Aika》)I hate to say this, but I don't think we're
going to be able to break through that thing.
We should turn back.\c"
M09901104,"\h(《Drachma》)We'll never be able to break through the Iron
Net, boy. Turn this boat around.\c"
M09909920,"\h(《High Priest》)Did you people come from the east?
Then I have nothing to talk to you about.
Go back to where you came from!\c"
M09909930,"\h(《Drachma》)This looks like the Valuan headquarters here
in these parts.\e"
M09909931,"\h(《Drachma》)Who knows what will happen if we just go
wanderin' around in there. We shouldn't get too
close, boy.\c"
M09901400,"\h(《Drachma》)What are you doin', boy?! Are you tryin' to
leave Valua?!\e"
M09901401,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah! Aren't we supposed to be looking for the
Yellow Crystal around here? Turn this boat
around Vyse!\c"
M09901402,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901403,"\h(《Drachma》)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09901500,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, hey! Where do you think you're going, Vyse?
That's Valuan homeland over there!\e"
M09901501,"\h(《Gilder》)Don't you think we have better things to do
than to pick another fight with the Valuans?
We should probably avoid this area.\c"
M09901502,"\h(《Aika》)Wait a second there, Fina. Isn't that Valua up
ahead?\e"
M09901503,"\h(《Aika》)What are we going to do with this little boat if
the Valuans decide to attack us? We probably
should stay out of there for now.\c"
M09901600,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901601,"\h(《Drachma》)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09909940,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! Look over there! There's some kind of
vortex! Maybe we can go inside it!\e"
M09909941,"\h(《Enrique》)Ugh… Per… Perhaps we should head over to…
ugh… Esparanza, first…\e"
M09909942,"\h(《Enrique》)I don't know… how much longer I can take…
this before I… ulp!\e"
M09909943,"\h(《Aika》)Heh… I swear… What are we going to do with
you, Enrique? I suppose we have no choice for
now. Vyse, let's head over to Esparanza!\c"
M09909944,"\h(《Enrique》)Ugh…
Please… can't we just… stop by Esparanza
first? I'm begging you… ulp!\c"
M09909945,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like we can get inside the Dark Rift
through here. Enrique, are you ready?\e"
M09909946,"\h(《Enrique》)… Yes, I'm ready. I don't suppose I have much
of a choice at this point. We must get through
the Dark Rift no matter what.\e"
M09909947,"\h(《Enrique》)Don't mind me… I will be fine. This is neither
the time nor the place to be complaining about
airsickness.\c"
M09902400,"\h(《Gilder》)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09902401,"\h(《Gilder》)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09902402,"\h(《Fina》)Aika… It looks like we've gone a little too far
to the north.\e"
M09902403,"\h(《Aika》)I think you're right.
Who knows what's up ahead. It might be a little
dangerous to go exploring right now.\e"
M09902404,"\h(《Aika》)And from what I can tell of the map, Daccat's
Island probably isn't north of here anyway.
Let's turn around and continue searching.\c"
M09909952,"\h(《Gilder》)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09909953,"\h(《Gilder》)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09909950,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse… do not return to Crescent Isle. I beg of
you.\e"
M09909951,"\h(《Enrique》)If I go back now… I… I'm afraid that my
determination will falter. I cannot allow myself
to do that…\c"
M09909960,"\h(《Vyse》)What's this?
There's something set into the statue's eye
socket…\e"
M09909961,\h(　)You found the “Golden Man's Eye.”\e
M09909962,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, no one will notice if it's missing, right?
And besides… we're Air Pirates!! Can you really
blame us for taking a little bit of treasure?\c"
M09909963,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm? Hey, Aika… do you see something glittering
on the ground? Right where the eye of that bird
would be…\e"
M09909964,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, you're right! Let me go down and see what
it is…\e"
M09909965,"\h(《Aika》)… Hey, Vyse! I found something! There was a gem
stuck into the ground! I'm sure they won't miss
a little, itty-bitty gem, would they?\e"
M09909966,\h(　)You found the “Great Bird's Eye.”\e
M09909967,"\h(《Aika》)Besides, who knows when a nice little gem like
this will come in handy?\c"
M09909968,"\h(《Fina》)I…
I can't believe that they actually used the
Rains of Destruction…\e"
M09909969,\h(《Aika》)Fina…\e
M09909970,"\h(《Gilder》)… Vyse, maybe we should head back to Crescent
Isle and take a minute to regroup. We can't do
anything to get into Soltis right now, anyway.\e"
M09909971,"\h(《Vyse》)… You're right.
I really hate to do this, but it looks like we
have no choice but to just head home for now.\c"
M09909972,"\h(《Vyse》)There's an incredibly strong wind blowing from
inside the Dark Rift.\e"
M09909973,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like it's going to be tough to get
through there even with the Delphinus…\c"
M09909974,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm… It looks like we've come out of the Dark
Rift on the same side that we went in on.\c"
M09909975,"\h(《Aika》)On the treasure map it says, “The dead will
always watch over my treasure.”\e"
M09909976,"\h(《Aika》)And there's a skull here on the eastern part of
the Valuan continent. I wonder if that has to
do with anything…\c"
M09909977,"\h(《Vyse》)… What's this place? Why are there buildings
being built on an island way down here?!\c"
M09909994,"\h(《Vyse》)It's too dangerous to go back there right now.
And, besides… I shouldn't let Gregorio's
sacrifice be in vain.\c"
M09909995,"\h(《Aika》)This is the Armada's homebase. We probably
shouldn't get too close, or we'll be asking for
trouble. Let's just turn the ship around…\c"
M09909978,"\h(《Aika》)We did it!!
We actually made it through the Dark Rift!!\e"
M09909979,"\h(《Enrique》)Well! I can't believe that we are actually going
to be able to see what lies east of the Dark
Rift! We're making history as we speak!\c"
M09909980,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! There are so many herbs and spices growing
here! I've never seen so many in one place
before!\e"
M09909981,"\h(《Vyse》)It's amazing… This place truly is a treasure
island.\e"
M09909982,"\h(《Fina》)But we really shouldn't disturb the island too
much…\e"
M09909983,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah… I suppose that if we took too many of the
seeds and stuff that the trees might not be able
to grow back.\e"
M09909984,"\h(《Aika》)… But, I'm sure it would be okay just to take a
little bit, right Vyse?\e"
M09909985,"\h(《Vyse》)I swear, Aika. You and your “just a little bit.”
Alright, alright… we'll take something with us.\e"
M09909986,\h(　)You received the spice “Khale.”\e
M09909987,"\h(《Drachma》)King Ixa'taka spoke of an Iron Net to the north
of this continent.\e"
M09909988,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah… But, if the Valuans escaped to the north,
that means they probably had to take down the
Iron Net, right?\e"
M09909989,"\h(《Drachma》)That means we'll be able to reach North Ocean
that way. We'll head straight to Valua from
there.\c"
M09909990,"\h(《Enrique》)In truth, the Delphinus has not yet been
completed.\e"
M09909991,"\h(《Enrique》)The hull hasn't been fully reinforced yet, so it
would probably be impossible to fly through
stone reefs at this point.\e"
M09909992,"\h(《Enrique》)And the engine's output settings haven't been
properly adjusted yet either, so we probably
won't be able fly through sky rifts.\e"
M09909993,"\h(《Engine》)However, if we can find some way to fix the hull
and the engine, I'm sure sky rifts and stone
reefs would pose no problem for this ship.\e"
M09909000,\h(《Dyne》)Wait… that's the legendary “Pirate's Grave!”\e
M09909001,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Good job, Vyse! I'm sure that the Sailors' Guild
would be more than happy to pay you for making
this Discovery!\e"
M09909002,"\h(《Vyse》)Guild?
Pay me for a Discovery?\e"
M09909003,"\h(《Dyne》)Much of this world is uncharted and shrouded
in legend. Ruins, strange creatures… all
sorts of things are waiting to be discovered.\e"
M09909004,"\h(《Dyne》)Any major port city will have a Sailors' Guild.
They pay explorers well for any information on
Discoveries that they've made.\e"
M09909005,"\h(《Dyne》)When you're flying through the skies and your
compass starts spinning around rapidly, that
means there's a Discovery nearby.\e"
M09909006,"\h(《Dyne》)If you try searching the area, you'll probably
find a Discovery. Just head over to the Sailors'
Guild afterwards and collect your reward.\e"
M09909007,"\h(《Dyne》)But, the longer you wait, the greater the chance
that someone else will beat you to it. So, you
should visit the Guild as soon as you can, okay?\c"
M09909008,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, before we set sail, do you have any
questions that you wanted to ask me?\e"
M09909009,"\h(《What will you say?》)“How do I steer this thing?”
“How do we get home from here?”
“No, not really.”\e"
M09909010,"\h(《Vyse》)Just to be safe, how exactly do I steer this
thing?\e"
M09909011,"\h(《Dyne》)I never thought I'd hear you ask something like
that. Heh… Nevertheless, pay close attention.\e"
M09909012,"\h(《Dyne》)Using the Control Stick, you can
move forward and backward.
You can turn left and right as well.\e"
M09909013,"\h(《Dyne》)Control your altitude by pressing the R and L
Buttons. R Button will raise the ship, while L
Button will lower it. The C Stick works as well.\e"
M09909014,"\h(《Dyne》)Whenever you want to search anything or whenever
you want to dock at a harbor, just press the
A Button.\e"
M09909015,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… don't laugh at me, Dad… er… Captain, but
I don't remember the way home from here. Could
you tell me where to go?\e"
M09909016,"\h(《Dyne》)How do you expect to become a good sailor if you
don't pay attention to where you are?! Just head
southeast from here.\e"
M09909017,"\h(《Dyne》)You'll recognize the island when you see it... 
hopefully. If you get lost, you can look at a
map using the Y Button.\e"
M09909018,"\h(《Dyne》)Also, you'll run into monsters on occasion as
you're sailing. If you do, run out to the deck
and take 'em out.\e"
M09909019,"\h(《Dyne》)One word of warning: there are these monsters
called Maroccas that live around here. They're
pretty tough.\e"
M09909020,"\h(《Dyne》)If you're not doing much damage on your enemy,
try hitting the Y Button to change the
properties of your weapon. It might work better.\c"
M09909021,"\h(《Dyne》)Well, then! Full speed ahead! Destination,
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909022,"\h(《Drachma》)That reminds me… you should have received
something called a “Captain's Stripe.”\e"
M09909023,"\h(《Drachma》)You'll receive one for every major battle that
you win. It's sort of like a trophy.\e"
M09909024,"\h(《Drachma》)If you “Use” a Captain's Stripe, it will make
your ship stronger.\e"
M09909025,"\h(《Vyse》)I see. Thanks for the advice, Captain.\c"
M09909026,"\h(《Drachma》)It looks like we picked up a “Magic Cannon” from
the lady admiral.\e"
M09909027,"\h(《Drachma》)Using this, we'll be able to fire cannonballs
charged with magical energy.\e"
M09909028,"\h(《Aika》)Just like Belleza was doing, right? That's
great! Vyse! Did you hear that?! We should
really put this thing to good use!\e"
M09909029,"\h(《Drachma》)Be careful though, boy. Using the Magic Cannon
uses up MP just like normal magic. So don't go
too crazy with it.\c"
M80600000,"\h(《Doc》)So, how're things going? Did you catch any
Moonfish?\e"
M80600001,"\h(《Doc》)Maria's counting on you! Make sure to bring back
a bunch of Moonfish for Maria's little friend!\c"
M80600002,"\h(《Doc》)Hey, guys! How've you been?
Thanks to all your hard work,
Maria and I have been doing just fine.\e"
M80600003,"\h(《Doc》)And hey... if you're ever in the area, feel
free to just stop on by whenever you want!\e"
M80600004,"\h(《Maria》)Vyse, come back soon!\c"
M80600005,"\h(《Maria》)Uncle Doc isn't here right now...
He had to go work.\e"
M80600006,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh really? I guess we should come back
some other time then...\e"
M80600007,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright, Maria. We'll be back soon!\c"
MQ0010000,"\h(《Curt Voice》)Hm? Can I help you? This ship here is a free
medical vessel. Are you here for treatment? You
sick or something?\e"
MQ0010001,"\h(《Vyse》)No, we're fine. We were just passing through the
area and saw your ship. We figured we'd come and
see who you were.\e"
MQ0010002,"\h(《Curt Voice》)Wait a second... your clothes! Your weapons!
Your eyepatch! You guys are Air Pirtes!\e"
MQ0010003,"\h(《Curt Voice》)You're just in time. There is something that I
want to ask of you guys... Please, come inside.\e"
MQ0010033,"\h(《Doc》)There should be Moonfish near or on Sailors'
Island. I'm sure if you look hard enough, you
can find them.\e"
MQ0010034,"\h(《Doc》)Be sure to check on top of roofs and behind
buildings! Check everywhere using your first
person point of view! Good luck!\c"
MQ0080000,"\h(《Young Female Voice》)So, you're the infamous Vyse. I pictured you to
be... taller. Nevertheless, I see that you have
taken the Black Spot that I put out.\e"
MQ0080001,\h(《Young Female Voice》)Stand by. I am boarding your ship.\c
MQ0180100,"\h(《Aika》)Hey... This looks like the ship of one of the
Pirates on the Sailors' Guild Wanted List!\e"
MQ0180101,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Move in closer.”
“Stay where you are.”\c"
MQ0180102,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm... This might turn into a bad situation if
we approach that ship now. Maybe we should
talk to him when we're a little more ready...\e"
MQ0220100,"\h(《Aika》)Isn't it a little fishy for a boat to be out
sailing alone way out here?\e"
MQ0220101,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Move in closer.”
“Stay where you are.”\c"
MQ0220102,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm... This might turn into a bad situation if
we approach that ship now. Maybe we should
talk to him when we're a little more ready...\e"
M80600008,"\h(《Doc》)Sorry, but I'm about to make a house call.
Can ya come back a little later?\c"
MQ0260100,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Enter Headquarters.”
“Fight the Special Air Pirate.”
“Return to the skies.”\c"
