MF0040000,\h(《Vyse》)That chunk of metal is huge!!!\e
MF0040001,"\h(《Fina》)Beneath it is “The Maw of Tartas.”
It's an entrance to a series of caverns.\e"
MF0040002,"\h(《Fina》)These caverns are the resting place of the 
Yellow Crystal as well as the Yellow Gigas.\e"
MF0040003,"\h(《Fina》)This seal was built by my people after the Rains
of Destruction in order to contain the Yellow 
Gigas. Now the Yellow Gigas lies dormant…\e"
MF0040004,\h(《Drachma》)Good… keep that thing locked up…\e
MF0040005,"\h(《Aika》)Well, I know this means that the Gigas can't get
out…\e"
MF0040006,"\h(《Aika》)But, it also means that we can't get in!\e"
MF0040007,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… I don't think there's any way we can get 
through this seal. What should we do?\e"
MF0040008,\h(　)Hey! Don't move!\e
MF0040009,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)The punishment for trespassing near the Great 
Seal is death!\e"
MF0050000,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)We… we surrender!
Please don't kill us.\e"
MF0050001,"\h(《Aika》)Tell us how to open the seal, and we'll let you 
live!\e"
MF0050002,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)That's impossible!
Our entire army couldn't open it!\e"
MF0050003,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Our commanders aren't concerned with the Yellow 
Crystal right now because it's already in Valua 
and it's safe from you.\e"
MF0050004,"\h(《Drachma》)Hmm…
That makes sense. They'll go after the other
Crystals first…\e"
MF0050005,"\h(《Vyse》)Something's not right… You'd think that this 
area would be more heavily guarded. Where are 
the rest of your men?\e"
MF0050006,\h(《Valuan Soldier》)They're preparing for the raid on Nasrad.\e
MF0050007,"\h(《Aika》)What?!
Valua is going to start a war with Nasr?\e"
MF0050008,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I, I think so.
I'm just a grunt, so I don't know any of the 
details…\e"
MF0050009,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)And there was a giant arcwhale…
It destroyed a few of our ships recently…
One of our Admirals is hunting it.\e"
MF0050010,\h(《Drachma》)A giant arcwhale?!\e
MF0050011,"\h(《Drachma》)Rhaknam is here?!
Answer me!\e"
MF0050012,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I, I don't know for certain. Some fog rolled in
yesterday and there were sightings of a huge 
creature!\e"
MF0050013,\h(《Drachma》)That means it's probably still in the area.\e
MF0050014,\h(《Drachma》)I have to go after Rhaknam…\e
MF0050015,"\h(《Drachma》)I've been following you kids around looking for
the Crystals all this time… but now it's your 
turn to follow me.\e"
MF0050016,"\h(《What will you do?》)“We understand. We'll go with you…”
“It's too dangerous…”\e"
MF0050017,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it doesn't look like we'll be able to get 
to the Yellow Crystal anytime soon. Okay 
Drachma, we'll go with you.\e"
MF0050018,"\h(《Drachma》)Very well… Now the time has come for me to 
finally face Rhaknam.\e"
MF0050019,"\h(《Drachma》)He was the reason that I got the Harpoon Cannon 
in the first place… I'm going to kill him… or 
die tryin'.\e"
MF0050020,\h(《Vyse》)It's too dangerous! Rhaknam will kill us all.\e
MF0050021,"\h(《Drachma》)If you don't come with me,
I'm leavin' you here…
In the hands of the Valuans. \e"
MF0050022,"\h(《Drachma》)It looks like you don't have much of a choice… 
boy…\e"
M01250000,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
M01250001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
M01250002,"\h(《Vyse》)Man… I can't believe that there's a Gigas
sealed somewhere under this thing…\c"
M01250003,"\h(《Enrique》)The Yellow Moon Crystal and the Yellow Gigas
are sealed beneath this stone tablet. We cannot
enter the Maw of Tartas from here, though.\e"
M01250004,"\h(《Enrique》)But, there is an interconnected series of
tunnels and crevasses underneath Valua. We might
be able to get in through there.\c"
