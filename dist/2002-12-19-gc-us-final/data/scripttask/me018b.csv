M07000000,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)This city was built by Valua during a time when
Valua was trying to extend its hand of influence
into the rumored countries of the Far East.\e"
M07000001,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)Everyone used to be full of hope here, but once
people realized that it was impossible to get
through the Dark Rift, that hope disappeared.\e"
M07000002,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)Then, one day, Valua decided to leave this city
to rot. The sailors here lost their ships, their
crews… and their dreams.\e"
M07000003,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)I noticed a bunch of ships gathering outside the
port. Don't tell me that they're planning on
trying to get to the east again…\e"
M07000004,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)If not, then why would Valua come back to the
town that they so easily threw away so many
years ago?\e"
M07000005,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)I hope they don't plan on using this city as 
target practice, since they have no more use
for it…\e"
M07000006,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)Isn't that Admiral Ironwall's ship? What's
Gregorio doing here? Well, there goes the
neighborhood…\c"
M07000007,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)I can't believe you defeated that old Admiral
Ironwall with just one ship. You guys are really
something.\e"
M07000008,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)I don't think I've ever seen a more impressive 
battle in my life. You sure had us all worried…\e"
M07000009,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)Oh, hey… it's you guys again.
Wait a minute… does that mean… that… you
sailed around the world?\e"
M07000010,"\h(《Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier》)Heh… when I look at you guys, I remember my 
youth and all of my old hopes and dreams come 
back to life.\e"
M07010000,"\h(《Sailor from the Little Shack》)Huh? What did you say?
You're trying to go to the east?\e"
M07010001,"\h(《Sailor from the Little Shack》)Not even the Valuans could get past that 
maelstrom. Don't talk crazy like that…\c"
M07010002,"\h(《Sailor from the Little Shack》)Huh? What did you say?
The Armada has come here?\e"
M07010003,"\h(《Sailor from the Little Shack》)Valua gave up on this town a long time ago. Why 
would they bother coming back?
Don't talk crazy like that…\e"
M07010004,"\h(《Sailor from the Little Shack》)That really was some fight.
It shook me right out of my bed!\e"
M07010005,"\h(《Sailor from the Little Shack》)I was so worked up during the fight that now,
I'm tired. I think I'll just go back to
sleep…\c"
M07010006,"\h(《Sailor from the Little Shack》)Huh? What did you say? You say you sailed
around the world?\e"
M07010007,"\h(《Sailor from the Little Shack》)What are you trying to say? That the edges of 
the world are actually connected?
Don't talk crazy like that…\e"
M07160000,\h(《Stray Huskra》)Pow… pooooow…\c
M07160001,\h(《Stray Huskra》)Pow! Pow! Pow!\c
M07160002,\h(《Stray Huskra》)Pow! Grr… Pow!\c
M05000000,"\h(《Enrique》)I… I don't think I'll be able to move for a 
while… Why… why don't you guys go ahead and 
check out the town?\e"
M05000001,"\h(《Enrique》)Ah, Vyse… you're back.
I think you need to see this…\e"
M03000000,\h(《Fina》)I'll stay here and make sure Enrique is okay.\e
Ms018a000,"\h(《Vyse》)A shipwreck? Or was it just abandoned?
It looks like it's been sitting here for a very
long time…\c"
Ms018a001,"\h(《Vyse》)That's a pretty old box.
There's some drinks and canned food inside,
but I don't know if they're still any good.\c"
Ms018a002,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a lot of drinks and food.
It looks like we can look forward to
a good meal.\c"
Ms018a003,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a gas tank. There's a date stamp, but it's
been partially rubbed off. Looks like it's
empty, though. Well, it's all rusted up, too.\c"
Ms018a004,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a gas tank. There's a date stamp, but it's
been partially rubbed off. Looks like it's
empty, though. Well, it's all rusted up, too.\c"
Ms018a005,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, this bed looks comfortable.
It's old, but fluffy. It seems like
it's hung out in the sun every day.\c"
Ms018a006,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a lot of old, yellowed books.
They're all about navigation, and
the Dark Rift.\c"
Ms018a007,"\h(《Vyse》)Ugh, the bed's covered with dust.
I guess it doesn't get used much.
I wish they'd at least clean it, though.\c"
Ms018a008,"\h(《Vyse》)A nice, fluffy mattress,
and clean, white sheets.
They're a little old, but nice.\c"
Ms018a009,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a lot of dust here.
Not only do they not get many guests,
it doesn't even seem like they want any.\c"
Ms018a010,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a brand new comb
and shaving set in the drawer.\c"
Ms018a011,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a half-finished letter
in the drawer.\e"
Ms018a012,"\h(《Vyse》)“I was able to trace my brother
as far as Esparanza.”\e"
Ms018a013,"\h(《Vyse》)“Perhaps everyone was right, and my brother
headed into the Dark Rift…”
… The letter ends here.\c"
Ms018a014,"\h(《Vyse》)I suppose this is a picture from back when this
town was still… lively. It's hard to imagine
that a time like that existed here…\c"
Ms018a015,"\h(《Vyse》)It's picture of when the town was more lively.
I guess the town is going to start looking more
like this again.\c"
Ms018a016,"\h(《Vyse》)… It's completely rusted.
This would probably explode if
you tried to fire it.\c"
Ms018a017,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, a treasure chest… Damn, I guess not.
It's just being used as a toolbox.\c"
Ms018a018,"\h(《Vyse》)What's this?
It's full of loqua and snacks.
Looks like someone isn't eating right.\c"
Ms018a019,"\h(《Vyse》)A campfire indoors?
This is an… interesting
way to cook food.\c"
Ms018a020,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a tattered Valuan flag… That's almost…
ironic. Especially considering that this place
started falling apart after Valua pulled out.\c"
Ms018a021,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… A gas tank, huh? Those really aren't that
common anymore. Maybe they don't use Moon Stones
as fuel around here…\c"
Ms018a022,"\h(《Vyse》)There's an old newspaper at the bottom
of the box. “The Birth of Prince Enrique!”
…Whoa. That's an old newspaper.\c"
Ms018a023,"\h(《Vyse》)There's some old bottles and flasks. It doesn't
look like they've been used in a long time.\c"
Ms018a024,"\h(《Vyse》)There's some old bottles and flasks. It doesn't
look like they've been used in a long time.\c"
Ms018a025,"\h(《Vyse》)Maybe there's some old invoices and
papers… and a few dead insects in
between the sheets.\c"
Ms018a026,"\h(《Vyse》)There's some recent receipts in the pile of
papers. It looks like trade has started to pick
up around here again.\c"
Ms018a027,"\h(《Vyse》)I should probably try to collect information
about the Dark Rift while I'm here.
We'll leave after that.\c"
Ms018a028,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
