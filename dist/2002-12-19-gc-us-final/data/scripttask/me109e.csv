MD0070000,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
So, this is a Moon Crystal…\e"
MD0070001,"\h(《Aika》)It's so beautiful…
I'm getting weak in the knees just looking at
it.\e"
MD0070002,"\h(《Fina》)A Moon Crystal is the most concentrated source
of energy that you will ever see. It was created
by distilling a Moon Stone into its purest form.\e"
MD0070003,"\h(《Fina》)Moon Crystals are pure energy.
This Crystal alone has the power of thousands…
no… tens of thousands of Moon Stones…\e"
MD0070004,"\h(《Vyse》)So this Crystal is powerful enough to control
one of the Gigas?\e"
MD0070005,\h(《Fina》)Look at the light radiating from the Crystal…\e
MD0070006,"\h(《Fina》)Even though thousands of years have passed since
the destruction of the Old World, the Crystal
still shines as bright as ever.\e"
MD0070007,"\h(《Fina》)Between the power of these Crystals, and the
destructive forces of the Gigas, it's easy to
see how so much of the world was destroyed.\e"
MD0070008,"\h(《Fina》)It's sad… The people of the Old World had so
much power, but they used it to make weapons
instead of helping each other.\e"
MD0070009,"\h(《Aika》)There's no way we can let Valua get their hands
on one of these!\e"
MD0070010,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, leave it up to us. We'll keep it safe.
The Valuans are going to have to take it off of
my dead body before I hand it over to them.\e"
MD0070011,"\h(《Vyse》)There's so much of the world that I still have
to see… I'm not going to let them wake some
ancient guardian to destroy half of it now…\e"
MD0070012,"\h(《Fina》)Thank you, Vyse! 
I know you will do your best to keep it safe.\e"
MD0070013,\h(　)You received the “Red Moon Crystal.”\e
M01090000,"\h(《Bellena》)Nasr basks in the light of the Red Moon. Most
of the creatures that live here have a strong
connection with it.\e"
M01090001,"\h(《Bellena》)Try using a Purple Moon Stone on your weapons.
You'll see that you can inflict much more damage
on them that way.\c"
M01090002,"\h(《Vyse》)… Hm. It won't budge.
Maybe there's a special way to open it.\c"
M01090003,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't get this door to budge at all.
It's too heavy to even move.\c"
M01090004,"\h(《Vyse》)… What's this? There looks like there's some
sort of switch on top of this pedestal.\c"
M01090005,"\h(《Vyse》)Whoa… It looks like the switch opens water
channels to this area.\c"
M01090006,"\h(《Vyse》)The magma has already been hardened so there's
no need to run any more water.\c"
M01090007,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like some sort of door.
Hm… I can't get it to budge, though.\c"
M01090008,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the pedestal where the Red Moon Crystal
was. It looks really old… but it's still in
perfect shape.\c"
M01090009,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder what this pedestal is for…
It's got a strange indentation
on the surface…\c"
M01090010,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to your ship.”
“Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01090011,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
M01090012,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
