MF0300000,\h(《Vyse》)Our ship! It's on fire!!!\e
MF0300001,"\h(《Ramirez》)Fina…
So, you are here.\e"
MF0300002,\h(《Ramirez》)I've been looking for you.\e
MF0300003,\h(《Fina》)Ramirez…\e
MF0300004,"\h(《Aika》)Fina, you know him?!\e"
MF0300005,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MF0300006,\h(《Vyse》)Did you lead this attack?!\e
MF0300007,"\h(《Ramirez》)Yes.
From this day on, Nasr belongs to the Valuan 
Empire.\e"
MF0300008,"\h(《Ramirez》)And…
I will be taking you back to Valua.\e"
MF0300009,\h(《Ramirez》)Surrender or you all die.\e
MF0300010,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse!
Please do as he says!\e"
MF0300011,\h(《Vyse》)Fina?!\e
MF0300012,"\h(《Fina》)Please… you won't be able to defeat him! 
Not yet! Do as he says…\e"
MF0300013,"\h(《What will you do?!》)“Surrender.”
“Fight… even though you know it is futile.”\e"
MF0300014,"\h(《Vyse》)Grr…
Alright… we surrender.\e"
MF0300015,\h(《Ramirez》)A wise choice.\e
MF0300016,"\h(《Ramirez》)Capture the Air Pirates.
Take them back to the Grand Fortress.\e"
MF0300017,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez…
Why are you doing this?\e"
MF0300018,\h(《Ramirez》)……\e
MF0300019,"\h(《Vyse》)We'll never surrender!
We'd rather die!\e"
MF0300020,\h(《Ramirez》)As you wish.\e
MF0300021,"\h(《Ramirez》)I would have spared you, but you leave me no 
choice.\e"
MF0310000,\h(《Gilder》)No… how…\e
MF0310001,\h(《Aika》)Vyse…\e
MF0310002,\h(《Vyse》)Can't… fight… any… longer…\e
MF0310003,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez…
Why…\e"
MF0310004,\h(《Ramirez》)……\e
M06000003,"\h(《Sailor》)I came intending to replenish my supplies in
Nasrad, but the place has burned to the ground!
What a shock!\e"
M06000004,"\h(《Sailor》)There's almost nothing being sold in the shops,
and even what's available is so expensive. But I
still have to replenish my supplies somehow...\c"
M06000005,"\h(《Sailor》)Let's see, I've bought the Moon Stones I need,
so now I have to find 5 barrels of drinking
water...   \e"
M06000006,"\h(《Sailor》)The shops are finally starting to fill up again.
Looks like I can start using Nasrad as a regular
resupply point again.\c"
M06010004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Let us see... A box of tomatoes with one, two...
No, this box is not any good either.\e"
M06010005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)When only this many survive the fire, you cannot
miscount even if you want to.\c"
M06010006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Ixa'takan cypress… Let us see, we have two, 
four… \e"
M06010007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Do not talk to me now!
I am busy with the relief supplies.\c"
M06330011,"\h(《Khazim》)Arghh!!… Crap! Dammit all! They called me the 
best gunner around! I was Khazim, the crack 
shot!\e"
M06330012,"\h(《Khazim》)But I let down my guard, and before I could do 
anything to stop them, the enemy turned the 
whole city to dust. \e"
M06330013,"\h(《Khazim》)It really chaps my hide! I think I will fly 
right over to Valua and give them a blast in the
chops!\e"
M06330014,"\h(《Vyse》)Calm down, calm down. You do anything like that,
and you'll get blasted right back. It's way too
reckless.\e"
M06330015,"\h(《Aika》)Ha, ha. So says the man who was so reckless as
to escape from Valua twice over.\e"
M06330016,"\h(《Khazim》)Wh, what is that? Y, you are not… ?\e"
M06330017,"\h(《Khazim》)Could you be that pirate Vyse who abducted the
Valuan prince and blasted your way out of the
Grand Fortress?\e"
M06330018,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I don't know about the abducted part, but 
otherwise, yes, I am indeed Vyse. \e"
M06330019,"\h(《Khazim》)In that case, you've got to do this for me,
Vyse! Let me join your crew!  \e"
M06330020,"\h(《Khazim》)I will never be satisfied until I have delivered
a blow from my cannon to Valua!\e"
M06330021,"\h(《Khazim》)I must join forces with you and become your 
ship's gunner. Good! It is decided!\e"
M06330022,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, well, it doesn't sound like you'll take no
for an answer, so I suppose we might as well
have you come aboard.\e"
M06330023,\h(　)Khazim has joined your crew as a “Gunner.”\c
M06340002,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)Our job was to defend Nasrad, but we were
completely helpless to do anything.\e"
M06340003,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)It makes me damn angry, and I'd sure like to go 
beat Valua to a pulp!\c"
M06350002,\h(《Khazim's Man》)Boss Khazim is in the turret on top of the wall!\e
M06350003,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)Boss says he's going to attack Valua and get
revenge even if he has to do it all by himself.\c"
Ms013d000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a hole left by the Armada's attack…
Countless innocent people were killed
by that attack…\c"
Ms013d001,"\h(《Vyse》)Most of the cargo's been burned, too.
The merchants must've taken a pretty big hit.\c"
Ms013d002,"\h(《Vyse》)There's still shortages of supplies,
but it looks like people are finally picking up
the pieces and starting to rebuild.\c"
Ms013d003,"\h(《Vyse》)The cargo is all either muddy
or burned… It doesn't look like
there's much they can still sell.\c"
Ms013d004,"\h(《Vyse》)There's still shortages of supplies,
but it looks like people are finally picking up
the pieces and starting to rebuild.\c"
Ms013d005,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm? I could have sworn this thing used to be
a lot longer. I guess the bombardment destroyed
the rest of it.\c"
Ms013d006,"\h(《Vyse》)This cart's been burned, too.
But, it still looks like it might be usable. I
suppose it's better than nothing…\c"
Ms013d007,"\h(《Vyse》)The castle wall was almost completely destroyed.
They kept the weapons and ammunition here,
so it probably was their first target.\c"
Ms013d008,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess one cannon couldn't do much
against such a large fleet…\c"
Ms013d009,"\h(《Vyse》)They must have hit the embattlements pretty
hard. The whole area was reduced to rubble.\c"
Ms013d010,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
