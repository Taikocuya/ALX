ME0090000,"\h(《Aika》)Uh-oh… I think we just stepped on some kind 
of switch.\e"
ME0090001,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… well, it doesn't look like anything 
happened. It was probably nothing.\e"
ME0090002,"\h(《Alfonso》)Well, De Loco… 
I've heard that the Air Pirates have crossed the
South Ocean and that they are on their way here.\e"
ME0090003,"\h(《De Loco》)Yes… I ran into them north of Horteka.
They ummm… narrowly escaped my Flame Cannon. \e"
ME0090004,"\h(《Alfonso》)Hehe… yes, well, fighting Air Pirates is a bit 
more difficult than burning down trees. 
But, I guess you already know that.\e"
ME0090005,"\h(《Alfonso》)Vyse was responsible for my demotion. I will 
make sure he suffers and I will prove to the 
world that I am Valua's greatest Admiral.\e"
ME0090006,"\h(《Alfonso》)Well, De Loco, I must be going. 
I have to exterminate some pests.\e"
ME0090007,"\h(《De Loco》)Idiot. Perhaps you should have stared into the
mirror a bit longer this morning… I think you
have a hair out of place.\e"
ME0090008,"\h(《De Loco》)As for you, Vyse, you damaged my precious 
Chameleon… You will pay for that… 
Oh, yes… You will pay…\e"
ME0090009,\h(《De Loco》)The next time we meet will be the last!\e
ME0090010,"\h(《De Loco》)Someone just set off the alarm!
I wonder who it could be…\e"
ME0090011,"\h(《De Loco》)Ah! Vyse! How nice of you to drop by. 
You saved me the trouble of finding you.\e"
ME0090012,"\h(《De Loco》)Yes… I know that you are searching for the Moon
Crystals as well… You must be trying to rescue
Isapa…\e"
ME0090013,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehe… good, good!
You see Vyse, these mines are full of traps… 
Too bad for you.\e"
ME0090014,"\h(《De Loco》)You can't escape, Vyse!
You will never leave these mines alive!!!\e"
ME0090015,\h(《Aika》)Um… the exit just closed by itself.\e
ME0090016,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't know about you guys, but I've got a
bad feeling about this place.\e"
ME0090017,"\h(《Alfonso》)Soon, Galcian will be taking orders from me.\e"
ME0090018,"\h(《Alfonso》)I simply don't understand why someone as 
noble as myself is forced to take orders 
from anyone other than Empress Teodora herself.\e"
M01110000,"\h(《Vyse》)A Valuan soldier…
I guess this is the Valuan stronghold.\c"
M01110001,"\h(《Vyse》)An Ixa'takan…
Valuans are probably forcing them to
mine for Moon Stones…\c"
M01110002,"\h(《Vyse》)This door has been welded shut…
It looks like they're serious about
keeping the Ixa'takans in here.\e"
M01110003,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, guys, but just hang in a little while
longer. I'll free all of you… I promise. I'll
send those Valuans back to Valua…\c"
M01110004,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn… This door's welded shut… It doesn't look
like I'm going to get any further this way.\c"
M01110005,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn this shutter…
It won't budge at all.\c"
M01110006,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a big shutter…
But, it doesn't look like it going to open.\c"
M01110007,"\h(《Vyse》)The door closed again. This is just great.
Why do I get the strange feeling that someone's
leading me somewhere…?\c"
M01110008,"\h(　)Perfect devices and perfect machines
are far more sacred than human life!
                            De Loco\c"
M01110009,"\h(　)Only perfect devices are worth anything!
Imperfect devices are garbage!
                             De Loco\c"
M01110010,"\h(　)Useless machines should be thrown away.
Useless people should be executed!
                               De Loco\c"
M01110011,"\h(　)Kill any Ixa'takan who tries
to resist!
                     De Loco\c"
M01110012,"\h(　)A Moon Stone pebble is worth
a gallon of blood!
                      De Loco\c"
M01110013,"\h(　)Treat my machines with respect,
or you'll be drawn and quartered!
                         De Loco\c"
M01110014,"\h(　)Inside this mine,
I am the law!
           De Loco\c"
M01110015,"\h(《Vyse》)Why do all these doors keep closing on me?
What's going on here?\c"
M01110016,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmph. Nope, it won't move.
It looks like the electricity's been cut.\c"
M01110017,"\h(《Captured Man》)Hm? You don't look like you're a Valuan…
Who might you be?\e"
M01110018,"\h(《Vyse》)It closed again…
It almost seems like someone's watching
what we do, and closing the doors…\c"
M01110019,"\h(《Vyse》)Nope… it won't open.
Looks like it's locked.\c"
M01110020,"\h(《Alfonso》)Uh… ugh…
W… Why do these things always happen to me?\c"
M01110021,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01110022,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01110023,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)I haven't seen you around here before.
Were you brought here recently?\e"
M01110024,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)A man named De Loco made this mine.
It's filled with nasty traps.\e"
M01110025,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)There's trap doors all over the place.
And remember, a circle doesn't always mean
it's the right way.\e"
M01110026,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)If you can see below,
look down. If there's a mining cart,
it'll come back here.\c"
M01110027,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)There's trap doors all over the place.
And remember, a circle doesn't always mean
it's the right way.\e"
M01110028,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)If you can see below,
look down. If there's a mining cart,
it'll come back here.\c"
