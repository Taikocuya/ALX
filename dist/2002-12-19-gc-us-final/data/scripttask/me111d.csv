ME0100000,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehe… good, good!
Soon, Vyse… very soon, you shall die!\e"
ME0100001,"\h(《De Loco》)And when you die, I want you to die slowly! 
Yes… slowly… really slowly… 
I want your brains to gush out of your head.\e"
ME0100002,"\h(《Alfonso》)Pardon me, De Loco.\e"
ME0100003,"\h(《Alfonso》)I didn't mean to interrupt one of your
intellectual monologues. I came to tell you
that Vyse has broken into the mines.\e"
ME0100004,"\h(《De Loco》)…And you figured this out all by yourself? 
What gave it away? Was it the alarm? 
Maybe it was the sirens.\e"
ME0100005,"\h(《Alfonso》)Yes, well… the fact is he was foolish enough to
deliver himself to me. I shall go dispose
of him.\e"
ME0100006,"\h(《De Loco》)You are the fool, Alfonso… Heh. The only reason
that you were made Admiral was because of your 
family. You don't stand a chance against Vyse.\e"
ME0100007,"\h(《De Loco》)I shall kill him. I want him to die! 
Die… DIE… DIE!!!\e"
ME0100008,\h(《De Loco》)Soon… very soon!!! Hehehehe!\e
ME0110000,\h(《Isapa》)And who might you be?\e
ME0110001,"\h(《Vyse》)Are you the High Priest, Isapa?\e"
ME0110002,"\h(《Isapa》)The one and only!
I am Isapa.\e"
ME0110003,"\h(《Vyse》)We're on a mission from King Ixa'taka.
We're here to rescue you!\e"
ME0110004,"\h(《Isapa》)Haha… well, the king knows what I like. 
Sending two beautiful women to come save me.\e"
ME0110005,"\h(《Isapa》)I have no use for you men…
Now if you'll just leave us alone for a while…\e"
ME0110006,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, really… 
There's no way that this dirty old man 
is a High Priest.\e"
ME0110007,"\h(《Isapa》)Oh… aren't you a pretty one?
In all of my years, I have never seen anyone
like you.\e"
ME0110008,"\h(《Isapa》)I believe that you are a Silvite. 
Am I right?\e"
ME0110009,"\h(《Fina》)What?!
How did you know?\e"
ME0110010,"\h(《Isapa》)Hahaha!
Instinct, my dear… Instinct. 
I am very observant… especially around women.\e"
ME0110011,"\h(《Isapa》)I could probably guess that goofy girl's
measurements…\e"
ME0110012,"\h(《Aika》)Okay, that does it… I know we have to bring him
back, but the king didn't say anything about
bringing him back conscious.\e"
ME0110013,"\h(《Vyse》)Relax, Aika… 
Right now we just have to worry about 
getting out of here alive. Let's go.\e"
ME0120000,"\h(《Aika》)I don't get it. 
Why would the Valuans build such a huge room in
these mines and not use it for anything?\e"
ME0120001,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't plan on sticking around long enough to
find out.\e"
ME0120002,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehehehehe!
So, you've made it this far!\e"
ME0120003,"\h(《De Loco》)I am impressed. But now you shall die!!!!! 
You will pay for what you did to my precious 
Chameleon! Oh yes, you will.\e"
ME0120004,"\h(《De Loco》)I love it! HAHA! 
All of the slaves who tried to run have died
in this room.\e"
ME0120005,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehe! Vyse, I want to hear you scream!\e"
ME0120006,\h(《De Loco》)Now I shall have my revenge!!!\e
ME0120007,"\h(《De Loco》)Let's start the show, shall we?\e"
ME0120008,\h(《De Loco》)Huh? Now what?\e
ME0120009,"\h(《Alfonso》)Long time no see, Vyse.
It is I… Alfonso.\e"
ME0120010,\h(《Alfonso》)I came here to watch you die!\e
ME0120011,"\h(《De Loco》)What are you doing?! Alfonso, you fool! \e"
ME0120012,"\h(《De Loco》)If you're in there, I won't be able to
crush them!\e"
ME0120013,"\h(《Alfonso》)Someone of my stature doesn't deal with 
filth like yourselves personally.\e"
ME0120014,\h(《Alfonso》)Antonio 2!!! Finish them!!!\e
ME0130000,"\h(《Alfonso》)What are you doing?! 
Not this way!!!\e"
ME0130001,\h(《Alfonso》)Aaarrrrgggghhh!\e
ME0130002,"\h(《De Loco》)Serves you right, Alfonso! You got 
what you deserved!\e"
ME0130003,"\h(《De Loco》)Oh, well… I guess I'll just have to skewer
all of you.\e"
ME0130004,\h(《Aika》)?\e
ME0130005,"\h(《De Loco》)What? What!? WHAT!?!?! What's going on? 
My traps have never failed me before!!!
Crush them! Crush them! Crush them!\e"
ME0130006,\h(《Vice Captain》)Admiral De Loco!\e
ME0130007,"\h(《Vice Captain》)Someone has tampered with all of the machines in
the mines. They are all malfunctioning!\e"
ME0130008,\h(《De Loco》)WHAAAT!?!?!?\e
ME0130009,"\h(《De Loco》)Why? Why? Why?
How can this be!?!?! I don't understand!!!!!\e"
ME0130010,\h(《De Loco》)Vyse!!! Why won't you just die!?!?\e
ME0130011,"\h(《Vice Captain》)Sir? 
Snap out of it! Please get a hold of yourself…\e"
ME0260000,"\h(《De Loco》)So, you've rescued Isapa… Very nice…\e"
ME0260001,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehe! But soon, you will die! 
You will die a horrible death and you will
scream and I will laugh!\e"
ME0260002,\h(《De Loco》)I've prepared my favorite room just for you… \e
ME0260003,"\h(《De Loco》)Please, come in and stay awhile…
Stay forever!!! Hehehehe!\e"
ME0270000,"\h(《Centime》)You made it out of the mines unharmed, I see.\e"
ME0270001,"\h(《Centime》)I made a few adjustments to some of the
machinery in the mines. Did it help?\e"
ME0270002,\h(《Aika》)So that's what that was…\e
ME0270003,"\h(《Centime》)Yes… yes… well, let's be on our way.
Ah yes, I managed to open the door to the 
outside as well.\e"
ME0270004,"\h(《Centime》)I must hurry back to see my family… 
They must be terribly worried about me.\e"
ME0270005,\h(《Aika》)You really know your stuff!\e
ME0270006,"\h(《Fina》)And he cares very much about his family
as well…\e"
ME0270007,"\h(《Vyse》)You're a good man, Centime…
We're glad we could help you.\e"
ME0270008,"\h(《Centime》)Thank you very much… Well, I must get going… 
Stop by and see me in Horteka when you get
a chance.\e"
M01110000,"\h(《Vyse》)A Valuan soldier…
I guess this is the Valuan stronghold.\c"
M01110001,"\h(《Vyse》)An Ixa'takan…
Valuans are probably forcing them to
mine for Moon Stones…\c"
M01110002,"\h(《Vyse》)This door has been welded shut…
It looks like they're serious about
keeping the Ixa'takans in here.\e"
M01110003,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, guys, but just hang in a little while
longer. I'll free all of you… I promise. I'll
send those Valuans back to Valua…\c"
M01110004,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn… This door's welded shut… It doesn't look
like I'm going to get any further this way.\c"
M01110005,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn this shutter…
It won't budge at all.\c"
M01110006,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a big shutter…
But, it doesn't look like it going to open.\c"
M01110007,"\h(《Vyse》)The door closed again. This is just great.
Why do I get the strange feeling that someone's
leading me somewhere…?\c"
M01110008,"\h(　)Perfect devices and perfect machines
are far more sacred than human life!
                            De Loco\c"
M01110009,"\h(　)Only perfect devices are worth anything!
Imperfect devices are garbage!
                             De Loco\c"
M01110010,"\h(　)Useless machines should be thrown away.
Useless people should be executed!
                               De Loco\c"
M01110011,"\h(　)Kill any Ixa'takan who tries
to resist!
                     De Loco\c"
M01110012,"\h(　)A Moon Stone pebble is worth
a gallon of blood!
                      De Loco\c"
M01110013,"\h(　)Treat my machines with respect,
or you'll be drawn and quartered!
                         De Loco\c"
M01110014,"\h(　)Inside this mine,
I am the law!
           De Loco\c"
M01110015,"\h(《Vyse》)Why do all these doors keep closing on me?
What's going on here?\c"
M01110016,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmph. Nope, it won't move.
It looks like the electricity's been cut.\c"
M01110017,"\h(《Captured Man》)Hm? You don't look like you're a Valuan…
Who might you be?\e"
M01110018,"\h(《Vyse》)It closed again…
It almost seems like someone's watching
what we do, and closing the doors…\c"
M01110019,"\h(《Vyse》)Nope… it won't open.
Looks like it's locked.\c"
M01110020,"\h(《Alfonso》)Uh… ugh…
W… Why do these things always happen to me?\c"
M01110021,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01110022,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01110023,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)I haven't seen you around here before.
Were you brought here recently?\e"
M01110024,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)A man named De Loco made this mine.
It's filled with nasty traps.\e"
M01110025,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)There's trap doors all over the place.
And remember, a circle doesn't always mean
it's the right way.\e"
M01110026,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)If you can see below,
look down. If there's a mining cart,
it'll come back here.\c"
M01110027,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)There's trap doors all over the place.
And remember, a circle doesn't always mean
it's the right way.\e"
M01110028,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)If you can see below,
look down. If there's a mining cart,
it'll come back here.\c"
