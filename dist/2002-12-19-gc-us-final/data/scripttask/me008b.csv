M90390000,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)I am known as the Mystery Merchant. I bring
goods from around the world. Many of these you 
may never see again!\e"
M90390001,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)I only carry rare and exotic items.
Come! See my wares for yourself!\e"
M90390002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M90390003,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)There exists in this world a rare type of Moon 
Stone shard called an “Abirik Cham”.\e"
M90390004,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Thank you very much. Perhaps our paths shall
cross again some day.\e"
M04000100,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Welcome. How goes the sailing? You wish to buy
cannons to blast your enemies out of the skies?\e"
M04000101,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we don't even have our own ship right now,
to be honest.\e"
M04000102,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well, that is very unfortunate. I wished to show
you my newest weapon called a “Torpedo.”\e"
M04000103,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)You can even set which round it will strike! It
is perfect for concentrating much firepower into
a short period of time.\c"
M04000104,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well well… Is it not Vyse the Ninny? Who are
you running from this time? Or perhaps you need
a bigger cannon to feel safe?\e"
M04000105,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, kid. How goes the sailing? I have cannons 
for all of your destructive needs!\e"
M04000106,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, kid. How goes the sailing? I have cannons 
for all of your destructive needs!\e"
M04000107,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey… are you not Vyse the Determined? Yes, I 
thought so. Keep up the good work. Do you wish 
to buy a cannon while you are here?\e"
M04000108,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)You are Vyse, are you not? I have heard about 
you. It is time someone put those Valuans in 
line. I respect that.\e"
M04000109,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, it is Vyse the Admirable! Do you wish to buy
a cannon or two from my humble shop? I would be
so happy!\e"
M04000110,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, it is Vyse the Bold! Do you wish to buy a
cannon or two from my humble shop? I would be so
happy!\e"
M04000111,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Ah, it is Vyse!
Heh… I wish that I were known as “the Valiant”
like you… \e"
M04000112,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Ah, it is Vyse!
Heh… I wish that I were known as “the Daring”
like you… \e"
M04000113,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, it is Vyse the Dashing! Do you wish to buy a
cannon or two from my humble shop? I would be so
happy!\e"
M04000114,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, Vyse! Er… I mean, Vyse the Fearless!
I would be honored if you bought something
from me!\e"
M04000115,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)The Red Moon be praised… I cannot believe that 
an actual hero is shopping in my humble store. 
It is an honor!\e"
M04000116,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)The Red Moon be praised… I cannot believe that 
the King of Rogues is shopping in my humble 
store. It is an honor!\e"
M04000117,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)V, Vyse! You are a legend! I would be so honored
if you wished to buy something from me… It
would make me feel so… important.\e"
M04000000,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, kid. How goes the sailing? I have cannons 
for all your destructive needs!\e"
M04000001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M04000003,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Check out my new weapons. They're called 
“Torpedoes!”\e"
M04000004,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)After firing, you will not hit the target until 
the following turn, and sometimes you can even 
delay it further, by a round or two!\e"
M04000005,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)It often misses but it is much more powerful 
than most cannons. I highly recommend it.\c"
M04000006,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)You heard that Nasrad was attacked by Valua and 
burned to the ground, yes?\e"
M04000007,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well, apparently the Valuans developed an engine
that allows them to cut through sky rifts,
and they launched a surprise attack.\e"
M04000008,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)It normally would not occur to anyone that they 
could make it through the sky rifts, so I guess 
the defenses were lax.\c"
M04000009,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)I heard a rumor that the Rains of Destruction 
fell upon Valua. Is it really so?\c"
M04000010,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Thank you!
May the Red Moon watch over you.\c"
M04010100,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Are you not the one they call Vyse the Ninny? 
Nice nickname. How did you earn it?\e"
M04010101,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Welcome to the Sailors' Guild. We pay very well 
for information on Discoveries!\e"
M04010102,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Welcome to the Sailors' Guild. We pay very well 
for information on Discoveries!\e"
M04010103,"\h(《Guildmaster》)So, you're the guy that everyone has been 
talking about? The one they call Vyse the 
Respected? Welcome to the Sailors' Guild.\e"
M04010104,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hey, it's Vyse the Admirable! Welcome to the
Sailors' Guild!\e"
M04010105,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hey, you are Vyse the Bold, yes? Welcome to the 
Sailors' Guild!\e"
M04010106,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Vyse the Valiant? Of course I have heard of you.
Everyone has been talking of your exploits.
Welcome to the Sailors' Guild.\e"
M04010107,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Vyse the Daring? Of course I have heard of you. 
Everyone has been talking of your exploits. 
Welcome to the Sailors' Guild.\e"
M04010108,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Oh, it is you! You are Vyse the Dashing!
Welcome to the Sailors' Guild! It is an honor!\e"
M04010109,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Oh, it is you! You are Vyse the Fearless!
Welcome to the Sailors' Guild! It is an honor!\e"
M04010110,"\h(《Guildmaster》)To think that Vyse the Hero would ever come to 
this guild… It is a true honor, sir.\e"
M04010111,"\h(《Guildmaster》)To think that the King of Rogues would ever come
to this guild… It's a true honor, sir.\e"
M04010112,"\h(《Guildmaster》)V, Vyse the Legend?! I feel honored just to be 
able to talk to one as great as yourself! W, 
welcome to the Sailors' Guild!\e"
M04010000,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Welcome to the Sailor's Guild. We pay very well 
for information on Discoveries!\e"
M04010001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell Discovery information.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M04010002,"\h(《Guildmaster》)What happened? Were you left behind by your
ship? That is an unfortunate tale.\e"
M04010003,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hmm… I'm sorry. I know of no one who may have a
ship available for rent right now.\e"
M04010004,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Well, since you are here without much choice,
you may as well try to enjoy your stay.\e"
M04010005,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I hear there is a beautiful new dancer at the
tavern.\c"
M04010006,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Well, since you are here without much choice, 
you may as well try to enjoy your stay.\e"
M04010007,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I hear there is a beautiful new dancer at the 
tavern.\e"
M04010008,"\h(《Guildmaster》)You're searching for ruins in the desert?
If you find them, I hope you'll let me know.
I pay quite well for information on such things.\e"
M04010009,"\h(《Guildmaster》)You are seeking Discoveries? Well, there is 
another named Domingo who is also searching the 
world for Discoveries.\e"
M04010010,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I have heard that he is one of the world's best
treasure hunters. You should try to stay a
Dhabu's length ahead of him.\c"
M04010011,"\h(《Guildmaster》)In every port of any size, you should always 
find a branch office of the Sailors' Guild. I 
suggest you pay a visit.\c"
M90390005,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)You should try feeding Abirik Chams to Silver 
animals. It will make them grow much faster.\c"
MQ0160100,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, isn't that one of the guys on the
Wanted List at the Sailors' Guild?\e"
MQ0160101,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Talk to him.”
“Avoid him.”\c"
MQ0160102,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm... This might turn into a bad situation if
we talk to him now. Maybe we should talk to him
when we're a little more ready...\c"
M04000118,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh! Hey, Vyse! I've been hearing bad rumors
about you lately. What happened to you? Did ya
hit your head on something hard?\e"
M04000119,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh wow! Vyse the Bounty King! I can't believe
you're shopping at my store! Wait until I tell
my mom! She'll go crazy!\e"
M04000120,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Vyse the Exploration King! I can't believe
you're shopping at my store! Wait until I tell
my mom! She'll go crazy!\e"
M04000121,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Sky Battle King Vyse! You MUST buy something!
Do you know what it will do for my business if
I tell people that you shop here? Please!!!\e"
M04000122,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh hey! It's Vyse the Fisher King! Did you come
here to buy fishing equipment?\e"
M04000123,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)V, Vyse the Battle Lord!! Tell me... Is it true
that you defeated someone by throwing a cannon
ball at their ship and sinking it?\e"
M04000124,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Vyse the Extravagant!!! I envy you... It's one
of my dreams in life to be rich. Really rich.
You wanna give me some money while you're here?\e"
M04000125,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Vyse the Charismatic! I can't believe you're
shopping at my store! Wait until I tell my mom!
She'll go crazy!\e"
M04010113,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hmmm... You know what? You look an awful lot
like one of those pirates on the Wanted List...\e"
M04010114,"\h(《Guildmaster》)It's Vyse the Bounty King! Let me thank you on
behalf of Mid Ocean for all the splendid work
you have done!\e"
M04010115,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Well, who would have thought that Exploration
King Vyse would ever grace this Guild with his
presence? I am honored, sir.\e"
M04010116,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I cannot believe it... Sky Battle King Vyse is
here. In my Guild. I am truly honored, sir.\e"
M04010117,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Well! It's Vyse the Fisher King!
Tell me...Do you love eating fish?
Or do you just really hate them?\e"
M04010118,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Vyse the Battle Lord! I... I don't know what to
say... I... uh... Please don't hurt me.\e"
M04010119,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Vyse the Extravagant! It's a pleasure to see
you. I've heard much about your spending habi...
uh... I mean your adventures!\e"
M04010120,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I cannot believe it... Vyse the Charismatic is
here. In my Guild. I am truly honored, sir.\e"
M04000200,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I hear that you defeated one of the bounties!
Well done! Here is your reward! You earned it!\e"
M04000201,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Here you go! Your reward for your work. I've
heard quite a bit about you lately. Keep up the
good work. I'm counting on you.\e"
M04000202,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Y, you defeated everyone on the Wanted List!
Thanks to you, people can sail the skies freely
and safely! It isn't much, but here. Take this.\e"
M04000203,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Wait just a minute. I almost forgot. Here...
This came here addressed to you.\e"
M04000204,\h(　)You received a “Black Spot.”\e
M04000205,"\h(《Guildmaster》)It's a message from the Angel of Death...
Sounds like you're in trouble. Better watch
your back out there.\e"
Mwanted00,"\h(　)You received 1,000 gold for defeating
“Baltor the Black Bearded.”\e"
Mwanted01,"\h(　)You received 2,000 gold for defeating
“Rupee of the Larso Clan.”\e"
Mwanted02,"\h(　)You received 4,000 gold for defeating

“Daikokuya the Wealthy.”\e"
Mwanted07,"\h(　)You received 30,000 gold for defeating
“Lord Zivilyn Bane.”\e"
Ms008b000,"\h(《Vyse》)This jar looks like it was unloaded from this
ship. It's labeled “Spices.” It's got an
interesting smell… I can't quite describe it.\c"
Ms008b001,"\h(《Vyse》)It says here that it contains Valuan gold. You
figure they wouldn't label the boxes like that…
well, it just makes us Air Pirates' jobs easier.\c"
Ms008b002,"\h(《Vyse》)Weapons, explosives…  Moon Stones… Yikes.
Maybe I shouldn't touch this box. That doesn't
sound like a very stable combination of things…\c"
Ms008b003,"\h(《Vyse》)A box of Nasr pottery… Nasr pottery is
supposedly the best in the world. I wonder
how much each pot is worth…\c"
Ms008b004,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a Nasr merchant ship. I wonder if I could…
Nah. I shouldn't just sneak on board. Who knows
what they'd do to me when they found me.\c"
Ms008b005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a huge bonfire. I suppose it won't ever
burn out because they're using Red Moon Stones
to keep it hot…\c"
Ms008b006,"\h(《Vyse》)There're a whole lot of crates stacked up in
here. They're labeled with country names from
all over. I wonder what's in them…\c"
Ms008b007,\h(《Vyse》)Heh… It's locked.\c
Ms008b008,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like this anchor has gone
through it's share of use and abuse.\c"
Ms008b009,"\h(《Vyse》)It's some sort of cannon.
Looks like a fire-powered gun,
common here in Nasr.\c"
Ms008b010,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Set sail for the Temple of Pyrynn.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms008b011,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms008b012,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
MD0020000,"\h(《Vyse》)So this is Maramba…
It's so… hot!\e"
MD0020001,"\h(《Aika》)…Huh?
Where'd the Cap'n go?\e"
MD0020002,\h(《Vyse》)Hey!\e
MD0020003,"\h(《Aika》)W… wait!
Cap'n! Where are you going?!\e"
MD0020004,"\h(《Drachma》)This is where we part company.
I've got my own quest to worry about. 
I've got to find Rhaknam.\e"
MD0020005,"\h(《Aika》)What?!
W… wait a second!\e"
MD0020006,"\h(《Aika》)What are we supposed to do?
We're in the middle of a desert without a ship.
How are we supposed to continue on our mission?\e"
MD0020007,"\h(《Drachma》)That is not my concern.
I have no interest in crystals or temples.\e"
MD0020008,"\h(《Drachma》)I must find Rhaknam. 
I cannot waste any more time babysittin'.\e"
MD0020009,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! Come back here,you eye-patch wearing freak!
You rusty old man!
Hey! Are you listening to me?!\e"
MD0020010,"\h(《Fina》)Oh, my!
This isn't good at all.
What should we do?\e"
MD0020011,"\h(《Aika》)We can't even get out of the city, 
let alone make it to the temple! 
We're stuck here.\e"
MD0020012,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we have no choice right now other than to
start exploring the city. Maybe we can find
someone who can take us to the temple.\e"
MD0020013,"\h(《Vyse》)That's all we can do… for now.
\e"
MD0020014,\h(　)Drachma has left the party.\e
MD0050000,"\h(《Bellena》)Good morning.
I trust you slept well last night…\e"
MD0050001,"\h(《Vyse》)It was the best night's sleep I've had in a long
time. So, I guess we should get ready and
start exploring the desert?\e"
MD0050002,"\h(《Bellena》)“Only those who have walked through the desert
can truly know its size,” is a saying we have
here in Nasr. \e"
MD0050003,"\h(《Bellena》)It's too difficult to cross the desert on foot,
because of the heat. A mere half day's walk can
be deadly… You'll need a ship to cross it.\e"
MD0050004,"\h(《Vyse》)A ship, huh?
Is this one yours?\e"
MD0050005,"\h(《Bellena》)Ah, yes.
It's not much, but it's very reliable.\e"
MD0050006,\h(《Aika》)Hmph…\e
MD0050007,"\h(《Aika》)… Umm, Bellena, why are you going out of your
way to give us a ride? You don't even know us.\e"
MD0050008,"\h(《Bellena》)You aren't very grateful are you? If you were
dying of thirst, and someone offered you water,
you would probably ask where it came from first.\e"
MD0050009,\h(《Aika》)What?!!! \e
MD0050010,"\h(《Bellena》)… Alright.
If you must know, then I'll tell you.\e"
MD0050011,"\h(《Bellena》)… My father was a soldier. He was a poor man
and sometimes a little short-tempered,
but he was a good man… and a good father.\e"
MD0050012,"\h(《Bellena》)We struggled to get by, and my father was barely
able to support us. We had nothing to rely on
but each other… But we were happy…\e"
MD0050013,\h(《Bellena》)Until that day… 20 years ago…\e
MD0050014,"\h(《Bellena》)20 years ago, Valua and Nasr declared war on
each other.
And my… my father was killed in battle.\e"
MD0050015,"\h(《Bellena》)When he died, we had nothing… no food…
nobody to support us… nobody to raise us…
We had to live on the streets.\e"
MD0050016,"\h(《Bellena》)Some say that you can't die from a broken heart,
but they're wrong… My mother died shortly after
my father… She was so sad… \e"
MD0050017,"\h(《Bellena》)I was alone… and scared. I had to fend for
myself on the streets. And that is how I ended
up living like… this.\e"
MD0050018,\h(《Fina》)Oh… Bellena… We're so sorry… We had no idea…\e
MD0050019,"\h(《Bellena》)Ever since then, I've hated war. Hundreds of
people die… Hundreds more families have to go
through what I went through.\e"
MD0050020,"\h(《Bellena》)And that is why, I'm letting you… 
No, I want you to use my ship. Please…\e"
MD0050021,"\h(《How will you answer?》)“We'll do it!”
“Hm… what should we do?”\e"
MD0050022,\h(《Vyse》)We'll do it!\e
MD0050023,"\h(《Bellena》)…Thank you, oh so much…\e"
MD0050024,\h(《Vyse》)Hm… what should we do?\e
MD0050025,"\h(《Aika》)… Vyse, let's use her ship. We… we know her
reasons… She's doing us a huge favor and it's
the least we can do for her.\e"
MD0050026,"\h(《Aika》)Bellena…
I… I'm sorry for… what I said earlier.
I… I shouldn't have spoken to you that way.\e"
MD0050027,"\h(《Aika》)I lost my parents when I was young, too. 
I know what you went through…\e"
MD0050028,"\h(《Bellena》)Heh heh… that's quite alright.
As long as you understand and don't take my
generosity for granted.\e"
MD0050029,"\h(《Bellena》)Alright everyone, get on board.
The Temple of Pyrynn lies far to the east,
in the middle of the desert. Let's go!\e"
MQ0160000,"\h(《Large Man》)Hmm, you have the look of a sailor about you.
Today is your lucky day. We're feeling generous,
so leave all your money and we'll let you live.\e"
MQ0160001,"\h(《Large Man》)Do not attempt to resist! We are the legendary
Air Pirates of the Larso Clan!\e"
MQ0160002,"\h(《Vyse》)So... You're Rupee Larso, eh? Good timing.
We were just looking for you.\e"
MQ0160003,"\h(《Vyse》)You've made quite a name for yourself, robbing
innocent sailors and all. As Blue Rogues, we
cannot sit idly and let you continue like this!\e"
MQ0160004,"\h(《Large Man》)You're quite brave for such a small boy. Very
well, then... Shall we battle here and get it
over with?\e"
MQ0160005,"\h(《Vyse》)No, wait. There's no need to cause needless
destruction in the city. Meet me at my ship.
We can fight on the deck.\e"
MQ0160006,"\h(《Large Man》)Out in the open, eh? Very well. Lead the way.\e"
MQ0160007,"\h(《Vyse》)I am Vyse of the Blue Rogues. Rupee Larso…
Prepare to defend yourself!\e"
MQ0160008,"\h(《Large Man》)Hahaha... You truly are a brave little boy.
However, you are mistaken about one thing.
I am not Rupee Larso.\e"
MQ0160009,"\h(《Large Man》)Master Rupee!
It is time to do battle!
Please come out here!\e"
MQ0160010,"\h(《Rupee》)Barta...
You know how I hate fighting...\e"
MQ0160011,"\h(《Barta》)Master Rupee! You are the head of the Larso
Clan! You should not say things like that!
There are enemies present!\e"
MQ0160012,"\h(《Barta》)Now that your father has passed away,
you are our leader! You must be strong!\e"
MQ0160013,"\h(《Aika》)This little runt is their leader? I'd heard
that the leader of the Larso Clan was a giant! I
guess I shouldn't believe everything I hear...\e"
MQ0160014,"\h(《Barta》)What did you say?!?! How dare you speak of
Master Rupee like that!
You shall pay for your insolence!!\e"
MQ0160015,"\h(《Barta》)I shall crush your skulls like so many
Loquat Berries!!\e"
MQ0160016,"\h(《Rupee》)Like Loquat Berries?!
Barta, do you always have to be so graphic??
It makes me sick to my stomach...\e"
MQ0160017,"\h(《Barta》)M, master Rupee! I was just trying to put fear
into them! Be strong!!
We are about to do battle!\e"
MQ0160018,"\h(《Barta》)Now, put your back into it! We must show them
the true power of the Larso Clan!!\e"
MQ0170000,"\h(《Barta》)Heh heh... Unbelievable.
The mighty Larso Clan has been defeated.\e"
MQ0170001,"\h(《Rupee》)Barta, that's why I said we shouldn't pick
fights like that in the first place!\e"
MQ0170002,"\h(《Vyse》)What's wrong, Rupee?
You don't like being an Air Pirate?\e"
MQ0170003,"\h(《Rupee》)Not really... I, I actually can't stand the
sight of blood. It makes me queasy.\e"
MQ0170004,"\h(《Rupee》)I'd much rather stay in town with my mom and
make carpets.\e"
MQ0170005,"\h(《Rupee》)In fact, my mother told me that the carpets I
made for her sold quickly and people are asking
for more of my designs!\e"
MQ0170006,"\h(《Barta》)M,M,M,M,Master Rupee!!! If... But... What will
happen to the Larso Clan? What will happen to
it's legacy??\e"
MQ0170007,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, a man has to follow his dreams.
If he doesn't want to be an Air Pirate, then
what's the point, right?\e"
MQ0170008,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm the son of an Air Pirate, too, and I'm sure
if I didn't want to follow in Dad's footsteps, I
wouldn't have. But, this is the life I chose.\e"
MQ0170009,"\h(《Vyse》)Rupee, if there's something else you'd rather
do, then do it. If you don't, you'll probably
regret it for the rest of your life.\e"
MQ0170010,"\h(《Rupee》)Really? So I can go back to the carpet store and
make carpets with my mom?\e"
MQ0170011,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course. Nothing is more important than your
dreams. Remember that.\e"
MQ0170012,"\h(《Rupee》)Sure!
I'll do my best!\e"
MQ0170013,"\h(《Barta》)M,M,M,M,Master Rupee!
W, what are you doing?!\e"
MQ0170014,"\h(《Aika》)Now you stay out of this! We beat you fair and
square, so if Vyse says Rupee can make carpets,
then Rupee is gonna make carpets, ok?!\e"
MQ0170015,\h(《Barta》)Heh heh heh...\e
MQ0170016,"\h(《Rupee》)Barta! Let's make carpets together!
I won't run away from this!\e"
MQ0170017,"\h(《Vyse》)I'll see you around, then, Rupee. We've got many
things to do and many things to see, but good
luck with your carpets.\e"
MQ0170018,"\h(《Rupee》)Thanks! I may not have been a very good Air
Pirate, but in the name of the Larso Clan, I'm
going to make the best carpets ever!\e"
