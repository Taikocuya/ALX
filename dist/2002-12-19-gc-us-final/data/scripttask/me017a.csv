MF0110000,\h(《Vyse》)I'm… I'm alive?\e
MF0110001,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like I've been separated from Aika and
Fina… I hope they're okay.\e"
MF0110002,\h(《Vyse》)Where am I?\e
MF0110003,"\h(　)Aika, Fina, and Drachma have left the party.\e"
MF0120000,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I guess I'm not the first guy to get 
shipwrecked on this island. From the look of 
his clothes, he was probably a sailor, too.\e"
MF0120001,\h(《Vyse》)Looks like he's been dead for a long time.\e
MF0120002,"\h(《Vyse》)There's something embroidered on his collar… 
“Gonzales.” I guess that was his name.\e"
MF0120003,"\h(《Vyse》)…Hmm?
There's something in his pocket…\e"
MF0120004,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a map!
It's a little old. Maybe it's a map of this 
island.\e"
MF0120005,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… there aren't any of the same landmarks…
It's probably a map of a different island.\e"
MF0120006,"\h(《Vyse》)It may come in handy some day.
I'll just hold onto this map for a while.\e"
MF0120007,\h(　)You received “Gonzales' Map.”\e
MF0120008,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I'll give you a proper burial, so you'll 
finally be able to rest in peace.\e"
MF0120009,"\h(《Vyse》)… There… 
Well, I guess I should find some high ground so 
I can check out the rest of the island.\e"
MF0130000,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I'm definitely on an island…
And an uninhabited one at that.\e"
MF0130001,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… looks like a storm is coming in. 
I should find some shelter.\e"
MF0130002,"\h(《Vyse》)There was a cave next to the spot where 
I buried Gonzales. Maybe I should check it out.\e"
MF0170000,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika… Fina…
Are you looking at the same Moon right now?
I hope you're alright.\e"
MF0170001,"\h(《Vyse》)And so I spent my first night alone on the 
deserted island.\e"
MF0170002,"\h(《Vyse》)I woke up to some fresh, clean air and a warm 
sun. \e"
MF0170003,"\h(《Vyse》)Ah, that felt great!
But, I'm really hungry right now…\e"
MF0170004,"\h(《Vyse》)If Gonzales survived long enough to settle into 
that cave, there's got to be food on this 
island. It's time to go hunting…\e"
MF0180000,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh man, I ate so much.
Those things actually taste pretty good.\e"
MF0180001,"\h(《Vyse》)I should have enough food to last me for a 
while.\e"
MF0180002,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder if this island is near any of the trade
routes… A ship has got to pass by here sooner
or later.\e"
MF0180003,"\h(《Vyse》)I should prepare some sort of signal fire in 
case I see any ships.\e"
MF0180004,"\h(《Vyse》)I spent my second day gathering food. 
Lucky for me that the island was inhabited by 
animals…\e"
MF0180005,"\h(《Vyse》)I started my third day with a big breakfast… 
Now it was time to get to work.\e"
MF0190000,\h(《Vyse》)… What?\e
MF0190001,\h(《Vyse》)… A ship!\e
MF0190002,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… why couldn't it have come a little
earlier? I wouldn't have spent all that time 
working on the boat!\e"
MF0190003,"\h(《Vyse》)Yes!!! They saw me!! Well, looks like I'm 
finally getting off of this rock.\e"
MF0320000,"\h(《Vyse》)I went to the highest point of the island that I
could reach and cleared away an area for a 
signal fire.\e"
MF0320001,"\h(《Vyse》)If a ship passes by, all I need to do is light 
it and they'll probably see it.\e"
MF0320002,"\h(《Vyse》)I've been stranded on this island for three 
days.\e"
MF0320003,"\h(《Vyse》)That night…
I had a dream about Aika, Fina, and even 
Drachma…\e"
MF0320004,\h(《Vyse》)On the fourth day…\e
MF0320005,"\h(《Vyse》)Ahh… this place isn't so bad…
Let's see…\e"
MF0320006,\h(《Vyse》)I need to gather some firewood…\e
MF0320007,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… they're dry and they're just about the 
right size. I should look for more sticks like 
these.\e"
MF0340000,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it's been raining all day. 
I guess I won't get much done.
I'll just rest for now.\e"
MF0340001,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't just want to sit around all day, 
hoping for a ship to pass by…\e"
MF0340002,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder if I can fix the lifeboat 
from the Little Jack?\e"
MF0340003,"\h(《Vyse》)It rained all day.
I spent most of the day resting in the cave.\e"
MF0340004,"\h(《Vyse》)This is my fifth night on this island…
First thing tomorrow, I'll try to fix 
the lifeboat!\e"
MF0340005,"\h(《Vyse》)Another good night's rest. It actually does feel
good to take a break from fighting monsters. 
Well, I better get started on fixing the boat!\e"
MF0340006,"\h(《Vyse》)Since this island has been deserted for a while,
there should be some Moon Stones lying around. 
The rain probably unearthed a bunch of them.\e"
MF0340007,"\h(《Vyse》)Here's one!
But I'll need more than one
to fly to the next island.\e"
MF0340008,\h(《Vyse》)Time to look for some more!\e
MF0360000,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright…
That should just about do it.\e"
MF0360001,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm finally going to be able to get off this 
island tomorrow!\e"
MF0370002,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika… Fina…
Wherever you are…
I hope you guys are safe…\e"
MF0370001,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it doesn't look like I have much of a 
choice, so I might as well set up camp in here 
and get some rest.\e"
MF0370000,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess my friend Gonzales had the same idea.
It looks like he was living here for quite a
while too.\e"
MG0180000,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, this is pretty amazing, huh?\e"
MG0180001,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, Enrique…
How does it feel to be outside the Imperial
Palace?\e"
MG0180002,\h(《Enrique》)Huh? Oh…\e
MG0180003,"\h(《Enrique》)Everything is so… ungh… so… beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it before.\e"
MG0180004,\h(《Aika》)Looks like someone is a little airsick.\e
MG0180005,"\h(《Aika》)Perhaps all of this traveling is a little rough 
for our sheltered Prince.\e"
MG0180006,"\h(《Enrique》)Yes… Aika… you are correct…
I… I never realized that sailing could be so… 
so… rough.\e"
MG0180007,"\h(《Enrique》)But this was my… decision…
I can't let a little airsickness…
slow me down…\e"
MG0180008,\h(《Enrique》)Ungh…!!!\e
MG0180009,"\h(《Fina》)Enrique…
Are you going to be alright?\e"
MG0180010,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it looks like this is going to be a long
trip for Enrique.\e"
MG0180011,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah, don't worry Enrique. Once you get used to
sailing, you won't get sick as easy. I'm sure
you'll be okay.\e"
MG0180012,"\h(《A gangly old man's voice》)Hey!
It took you guys long enough to get here!\e"
MG0180013,"\h(《Small Old Man》)Hey! Hey!
It's good to meet you!
You're Vyse, right?!\e"
MG0180014,"\h(《Gangly Old Man》)Gilder told us that you needed a crew. 
We're here to report for duty.\e"
MG0180015,"\h(《Brabham》)I'm Brabham!
If anything's broke, I can fix it! I'm the
greatest engineer that ever lived!\e"
MG0180016,"\h(《Brabham》)That's a nice lookin' ship! If you want, I can
get it running smoother than ever! Crank it up a
few notches… give it more power…\e"
MG0180017,"\h(《Izmael》)Ba-ba-bam! I'm Izmael. You want something built?
I build it. You don't want something built?
I build it anyway.\e"
MG0180018,"\h(《Izmael》)I'll build some buildings for you! You're going
to need a base, right? \e"
MG0180019,\h(《Vyse》)Uhh… sure… thank you.\e
MG0180020,"\h(《Brabham》)Leave it up to us!!
… But, before we get started, we'll need some
funds to cover expenses and labor.\e"
MG0180021,"\h(《Brabham》)First, I'll fortify the hull of your ship so you
will be able to pass through the stone reefs.\e"
MG0180022,"\h(《Brabham》)Then, I will upgrade your engine so… You'll be
powering through sky rifts in no time.\e"
MG0180023,"\h(《Brabham》)But it will cost you…
25,000 gold.\e"
MG0180024,"\h(《Izmael》)I plan to build you a port and some living
quarters first.\e"
MG0180025,"\h(《Izmael》)Let's see…
Cha-ching! I'll need about 75,000 gold. 
What a bargain!\e"
MG0180026,"\h(《Aika》)What?!
So all together, we'll need to give you 100,000
gold?!\e"
MG0180027,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, the Delphinus does need some
modifications, and we are going to need more
than a couple of caves to call this a base…\e"
MG0180028,"\h(《Vyse》)Enrique is right. Let's put off our search for
the other Moon Crystals until we can get 100,000
gold to pay these… umm… gentlemen.\e"
MG0190000,"\h(《Aika》)Oh! I just remembered!
We were talking about making a new flag, right?\e"
MG0190001,"\h(《Aika》)If everyone is finished, we can decide on one.\e"
MG0190002,"\h(《Enrique》)I'd forgotten all about that.
Alright, Vyse… you first.\e"
MG0190003,\h(《Vyse》)What? Me first?\e
MG0190004,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… well, I put a lot of thought into this.
Don't laugh, people…\e"
MG0190005,"\h(《Vyse》)This is what I drew.
Being Air Pirates and all, I figured we should
at least have a skull in the flag…\e"
MG0190006,"\h(《Vyse》)And since most pirates use swords, 
I figured we should have one 
of those on the flag, too.\e"
MG0190007,"\h(《Aika》)Hey!
That's pretty good!\e"
MG0190008,"\h(《Enrique》)Alright… Aika, you're next.\e"
MG0190009,"\h(《Aika》)I figured the skull thing was overdone, so I
tried to go with something quick and cunning.
That's why I drew a cat.\e"
MG0190010,"\h(《Aika》)I drew some gold to show people that we'd sneak
up on them and steal their gold before they knew
what happened.\e"
MG0190011,"\h(《Fina》)Haha…
Aika, that cat looks just like you!\e"
MG0190012,"\h(《Aika》)Well, I had to give the cat some personality. 
Do you think I got a little carried away?\e"
MG0190013,"\h(《Vyse》)Waaay too carried away. Heh heh…
Alright, Fina… it's your turn.\e"
MG0190014,"\h(《Fina》)Well… I felt that skulls were a little too
scary, so I wanted to make something happier.\e"
MG0190015,"\h(《Fina》)The word Delphinus refers to an ancient creature
that lived in the seas. I drew one of them to
show everyone what our ship was named after.\e"
MG0190016,"\h(《Aika》)There's no reason to be embarassed, Fina!
I don't think there's ever been an Air Pirate
flag that looked like this! I like it.\e"
MG0190017,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, that's all of them.\e"
MG0190018,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, you're the Captain…
Which one do you like?\e"
MG0190019,"\h(《Which one will you pick?》)“Sorry, but I like the one I made.”
“Aika's flag is good.”
“I've decided on Fina's flag.”\e"
MG0190020,"\h(《Vyse》)…I hope I don't sound too selfish saying this,
but I'd like to stick with my flag. It shows
everyone that we mean business.\e"
MG0190021,"\h(《Enrique》)I don't think there's anything wrong with that. 
It's very straightforward and it shows 
what the Blue Rogues are all about.\e"
MG0190022,"\h(《Aika》)I agree!
Then we'll use Vyse's.\e"
MG0190023,"\h(《Fina》)I'll make a big one and put it inside the
bridge!\e"
MG0190024,"\h(《Vyse》)I think Aika's flag will lift the spirits of the
crew… \e"
MG0190025,"\h(《Enrique》)Yes, I agree. I like what it stands for, and it
is pretty funny.\e"
MG0190026,\h(《Aika》)Thanks! I'm glad you like it.\e
MG0190027,\h(《Fina》)I'll make a big one and put it on the bridge.\e
MG0190028,"\h(《Vyse》)I think I like Fina's flag. It's very original
and people will remember the name of our ship.\e"
MG0190029,"\h(《Vyse》)It doesn't exactly strike fear into the hearts
of anyone, but it shows our good intentions.\e"
MG0190030,"\h(《Fina》)Oh, thank you.
I'm so glad… when I first drew it, I thought it
might be a little strange…\e"
MG0190031,"\h(《Aika》)Well then, I'll hang one up in the bridge, too!!\e"
MG0190032,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, it's getting late…
I'm starting to get hungry, too.\e"
MG0190033,"\h(《Brabham》)Hey, everyone!
Dinner is ready!\e"
MG0190034,\h(《Aika》)Great timing!\e
MG0190035,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it looks like we're spending the night at
our new headquarters… Crescent Isle.\e"
MG0200000,"\h(《Aika》)Well, the improvements to our ship are almost 
finished. And pretty soon, we'll have an actual 
base on this island.\e"
MG0200001,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah.
Starting tomorrow, we should start searching for
the remaining Moon Crystals.\e"
MG0200002,\h(《Enrique》)Yes… but I hope this time I won't get airsick…\e
MG0200003,\h(《Vyse》)Hahaha… You'll have to get over that!\e
MG0200004,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, Fina, there's something that I wanted to ask
you.\e"
MG0200005,"\h(《Aika》)That Admiral… umm… what was his name? Ramirez?
How do you know him?\e"
MG0200006,\h(《Fina》)What?\e
MG0200007,"\h(《Aika》)When we met him in Nasrad, you seemed to know an
awful lot about him.\e"
MG0200008,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MG0200009,"\h(《Aika》)If you don't feel like telling me, it's okay…
Don't worry about it.\e"
MG0200010,"\h(《Fina》)…No, I'm sorry. I should have told all of you
about him sooner.\e"
MG0200011,"\h(《Fina》)I will tell you everything I know about…
Ramirez.\e"
MG0200012,"\h(《Fina》)You know that I am a Silvite… a descendant of
the Silver Civilization…\e"
MG0200013,\h(《Fina》)Ramirez is a Silvite as well.\e
MG0200014,\h(《Vyse》)What?!\e
MG0200015,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez was our best warrior. He can channel the
power of the Silver Moon through his blade,
making it sharp enough to cut through light.\e"
MG0200016,"\h(《Fina》)We grew up together… A long time ago,
he was one of my best friends.\e"
MG0200017,"\h(《Fina》)He didn't used to be so… so heartless and
cruel.\e"
MG0200018,\h(《Fina》)He used to care for me like a little sister.\e
MG0200019,"\h(《Fina》)When we heard that the Valuans were trying to
reawaken the Gigas, Ramirez volunteered to come
down here to stop them.\e"
MG0200020,"\h(《Fina》)He went on a journey to search for the
Crystals… alone.\e"
MG0200021,"\h(《Fina》)Shortly after he started his quest,
we lost track of him.\e"
MG0200022,"\h(《Fina》)We never even dreamed that he would join forces
with the Valuan Empire. Those were the people
that he was sent here to stop.\e"
MG0200023,\h(《Fina》)I don't know why he changed.\e
MG0200024,"\h(《Fina》)I hope that the Ramirez I knew isn't gone
forever.\e"
MG0200025,"\h(《Enrique》)Admiral Ramirez. Not only is he one of Valua's
greatest swordsmen, but he is also a master
strategist.\e"
MG0200026,"\h(《Enrique》)He used to be Galcian's Vice Captain. But, I
don't even think Galcian knows Ramirez's past.\e"
MG0200027,\h(《Aika》)Fina…\e
MG0200028,\h(《Vyse》)……\e
MG0200029,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Instill her with confidence.”
“Try and cheer her up.”\e"
MG0200030,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina… I'm sure we'll find out what happened to
Ramirez… \e"
MG0200031,"\h(《Vyse》)What's important now is to keep pushing forward.
Don't ever forget that.\e"
MG0200032,\h(《Fina》)Vyse…\e
MG0200033,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't give up, Fina.
You aren't alone. 
We're here with you now.\e"
MG0200034,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah, Fina!
You're one of our friends now.\e"
MG0200035,"\h(《Enrique》)I've only known you for a short while, but I,
too, consider you my friend.\e"
MG0200036,"\h(《Vyse》)Cheer up, Fina!
We're here with you now!\e"
MG0200037,"\h(《Vyse》)Two Air Pirates, a Silvite, two crazy old men,
a snot-nosed brat, and an airsick Prince! Valua
doesn't stand a chance against us.\e"
MG0200038,"\h(《Vyse》)There's no other ship that can boast a more
motley crew!\e"
MG0200039,\h(《Fina》)Vyse…\e
MG0200040,"\h(《Aika》)Fina, what Vyse is trying to say… 
is that you aren't alone… \e"
MG0200041,"\h(《Enrique》)I'm not sure if I appreciate his comment about
the airsickness, but we're all together now.\e"
MG0200042,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse…
Aika… 
Enrique…\e"
MG0200043,"\h(《Fina》)When I came here, I was all alone… 
Now I have so many wonderful friends… 
Thank you so much.\e"
MG0200044,"\h(《Fina》)Thank you all.
I… I will do my best.\e"
MG0200045,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright! So, tomorrow, we continue our search
for the rest of the Moon Crystals! We'll start
early.\e"
MG0200046,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, Enrique… 
Are you sure you can get up on time without a
servant to wake you?\e"
MG0200047,"\h(《Enrique》)Hey! I always get up on my own! I don't need any
servants…\e"
MF0330000,\h(《Vyse》)Well I have enough firewood to last me a while.\e
MF0330001,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like it's going to rain soon… 
I should call it quits for today.\e"
MF0330002,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it was my fourth day on this island and 
I'm really starting to miss sailing.\e"
MF0330003,"\h(《Vyse》)I suppose I just have to think of this as some
sort of vacation and deal with it…\e"
MF0330004,\h(《Vyse》)On the fifth day…\e
MF0350000,"\h(《Vyse》)These Moon Stones haven't been processed yet. 
They may not give off much power, but it should 
be enough to power this little lifeboat.\e"
MF0350001,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like I'll finally make it off of this 
island.\e"
MF0350002,"\h(《Vyse》)I started working on the boat.
This island is full of trees, so I won't have to
worry about running out of materials.\e"
MF0350003,"\h(《Vyse》)Eating the food that I saved up, I spent the 
next few days hard at work on the boat.\e"
MF0350004,\h(《Vyse》)One week passed…\e
M14000000,"\h(《Brabham》)So, do you have the 25,000 gold that I need
to modify your ship?\e"
M14000001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Give 25,000 gold to Brabham.”
“Have him take care of it later.”\e"
M14000002,"\h(　)You gave Brabham 25,000 gold.\e"
M14000003,"\h(《Brabham》)Yippee!
Now I can fortify the hull
of the Delphinus for you!\e"
M14000004,"\h(《Brabham》)You'll be going through stone reefs and 
sky rifts in no time!\e"
M14000005,"\h(《Brabham》)Heh… This will probably take all night.
But don't you worry, I'll make sure that the
ship will be ready to go by tomorrow morning!\e"
M14000006,\h(《Vyse》)I'm counting on you Brabham!\e
M14000007,"\h(《Aika》)Now we'll be able to go after the rest 
of the Moon Crystals!\c"
M14000008,"\h(《Brabham》)Huh? 
Hey, I wasn't born yesterday, you know. \e"
M14000009,"\h(《Brabham》)When you get the 25,000 gold together,
gimme a holler!\c"
M14000010,"\h(《Brabham》)I'm itchin' to get started on the hull 
for your ship. Stop by when you're ready!
\c"
M14000011,"\h(《Brabham》)Just you wait, Skipper! You'll be flyin' through
those stone reefs and sky rifts like 
they were nothin'.\c"
M14000012,"\h(《Brabham》)Hey, Captain Vyse. 
How's the Delphinus doing? That's a mighty 
fine lookin' ship if ya ask me!\c"
M14010000,"\h(《Izmael》)I'll need 75,000 gold to start building your
headquarters.\e"
M14010001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Give 75,000 gold to Izmael.”
“Give it to him later.”\e"
M14010002,"\h(　)You gave Izmael 75,000 gold.\e"
M14010003,"\h(《Izmael》)Don't worry… This will be the best investment
of your life!\e"
M14010004,"\h(《Izmael》)I wish this base wasn't so secret! 
I want everyone to see how great it's
going to be!\e"
M14010005,"\h(《Izmael》)The new hull of Delphinus will be done by 
tomorrow morning. Then you'll be able to
go after those Crystals!\c"
M14010006,\h(《Vyse》)I'm counting on you Izmael!\e
M14010007,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, I'm so excited! We're going to have our 
own base and the Delphinus will be able to go 
just about anywhere!\c"
M14010008,\h(《Izmael》)It looks like you don't have enough gold.\e
M14010009,"\h(《Izmael》)That's too bad… Well, when you have
75,000 gold, come back and talk to me again. 
I'll make ya the best base ever!\c"
M14010010,"\h(《Izmael》)That's too bad… Well, when you have
75,000 gold, just come and talk to me again. 
I'll make ya proud!\c"
M14000013,"\h(《Izmael》)I'll be sure to build you a base that 
you can be proud of! \c"
M14010011,"\h(《Izmael》)Building a base is going to take a while. I need
to start with the foundation and work my way 
up! It will be worth the wait, trust me!\e"
M14010012,"\h(《Izmael》)So, if you're goin' after them Moon Crystals, 
now's a good time. I should have the base 
finished by the time you get back.\c"
Ms017a000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the lifeboat I came here on. It doesn't
look like it's in very good shape…
I wonder what happened to everyone else…\c"
Ms017a001,"\h(《Vyse》)Gonzales…
Don't worry, I'll make you a grave as
soon as I get the chance.\c"
Ms017a002,"\h(《Vyse》)Gonzales…
I'm sorry it's such a simple grave,
but I hope now you can rest in peace.\c"
Ms017a024,"\h(《Vyse》)Gonzales…
I'll find that treasure
you were looking for!\c"
Ms017a025,"\h(《Vyse》)Gonzales… Just to let you know…
Daccat said that the most valuable treasure
in the world is comradery…\e"
Ms017a026,"\h(《Vyse》)I hear that you had a good friend named Pedro.
Well then, I suppose you didn't need to find
Daccat's Island after all…\c"
Ms017a003,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess now I just have to wait
for a ship to pass by
and notice the signal fire.\c"
Ms017a027,"\h(《Vyse》)This is where I lit the signal fire.
If it weren't for this, Gilder probably
never would have found me.\c"
Ms017a028,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like someone used to live in here…
Well, before I settle down, I should probably
check out the rest of the island…\c"
Ms017a004,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like a diary…
Maybe it's Gonzales'…\e"
Ms017a005,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Read the diary.”
“Nothing.”\e"
Ms017a006,"\h(《Gonzales' Diary》)“It's been 20 years since I landed here…
No ships pass by, and I have no means to
build my own.”\e"
Ms017a007,"\h(《Gonzales' Diary》)“Living as a sailor, I knew that there was a
possibility that this could happen one day.
But…”\e"
Ms017a008,"\h(《Gonzales' Diary》)“My only regret is that I could not fulfill
my promise…”\c"
Ms017a009,\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… Maybe later.\c
Ms017a010,\h(　)You received ＊＊＊＊!\c
Ms017a029,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like someone used to live in here…
Well, before I settle down, I should probably
check out the rest of the island…\c"
Ms017a011,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a bed made out of a torn sail, draped over
some dried grass… It's not much, but it's
better than sleeping on the floor, I guess.\c"
Ms017a030,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the bed that Gonzales made.
Maybe I should rest for a bit.\e"
Ms017a031,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take a little break.”
“Walk around the island some more.”\e"
Ms017a032,"\h(《Vyse》)I feel a little rested now.
Time to get to work…\c"
Ms017a033,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm not really that tired yet. Maybe I'll
look around the island some more first.\c"
Ms017a034,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like someone used to live in here…
Well, before I settle down, I should probably
check out the rest of the island…\c"
Ms017a012,"\h(《Vyse》)Gonzales must have been
counting the days on this wall.\e"
Ms017a013,"\h(《Vyse》)Man… He spent all that time waiting for a ship
and he never made it off this island. I don't
plan to let that happen to me…\c"
Ms017a035,"\h(《Vyse》)These are marks Gonzales made,
to count the days…\e"
Ms017a036,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a fate worse than death
for a sailor to lose his wings,
and not be able to fly.\c"
Ms017a014,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm…
This looks like it's about the right size
for making a fire.\c"
Ms017a015,"\h(《Vyse》)This one's nice and dry…
There's more here than I thought.\c"
Ms017a016,"\h(《Vyse》)Okay, this is the third one.
If I can find just two more,
I'll be able to start a fire.\c"
Ms017a017,"\h(《Vyse》)This is a good size.
Alright, one more.\c"
Ms017a018,"\h(《Vyse》)This should be enough to build a
decent sized fire!\c"
Ms017a019,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, found one! I guess I'm pretty lucky that it
rained yesterday, otherwise I'd probably never
have found any of these Moon Stones!\c"
Ms017a020,"\h(《Vyse》)Here's another one. I'm lucky this is a deserted
island, or else these Moon Stones probably would
have been found a long time ago…\c"
Ms017a021,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, here's one.
It's a Red Moon Stone…
Which means I'm probably somewhere near Nasr…\c"
Ms017a022,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… found another one.
Hmm… One more would probably
be enough.\c"
Ms017a023,"\h(《Vyse》)Last one!
Man, I'm so lucky that there were plenty of
Moon Stones on this island…\c"
Ms017a037,"\h(《Aika》)What's this?
It looks like a grave…\c"
Ms017a038,"\h(《Aika》)It looks like someone lit a signal fire here
recently. Was there someone living on this
island or something?\c"
Ms017a040,"\h(《Aika》)It looks like a diary.
I guess the person who lived here wrote it.
I wonder what it says…\e"
Ms017a041,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Read the diary.”
“Nothing.”\e"
Ms017a042,"\h(《Castaway's Diary》)“It's been 20 years since I landed here…
No ships pass by, and I have no means to
build my own.”\e"
Ms017a043,"\h(《Castaway's Diary》)“Living as a sailor, I knew that there was a
possibility that this could happen one day.
But…”\e"
Ms017a044,"\h(《Castaway's Diary》)“My only regret is that I could not fulfill
my promise…”\c"
Ms017a045,\h(《Aika》)Hmm… Maybe not. We should probably get going.\c
Ms017a046,"\h(《Aika》)Ooh… There's a bed.
Maybe we should take a break.\e"
Ms017a047,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Rest for a little while.”
“Get going.”\e"
Ms017a048,"\h(《Aika》)Oh man, I feel so much better!
Well, now that we're fully rested,
we should probably get going!\c"
Ms017a049,"\h(《Aika》)Well, I'm not actually all that tired, and
we should probably get going…\c"
Ms017a050,"\h(《Aika》)There's a lot of marks on the wall…
I guess whoever lived here
was counting the days.\c"
Ms017a051,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)“Head to Daccat's Island!”
“Stay on this island a little longer.”\c"
Ms017a052,"\h(《Well, then…》)“Head to Daccat's Island!”
“Stay on this island a little longer.”\c"
Ms017a053,"\h(《Well, then…》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay on this island a little longer.”\c"
Ms017a055,"\h(《Well, then…》)“Let's leave.”
“Let's stay on this island a little longer.”\c"
Ms017a054,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm… This meat looks
pretty tasty.
Maybe I'll look for some more.\c"
