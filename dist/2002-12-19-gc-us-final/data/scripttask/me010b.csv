ME0030000,"\h(《Boy》)Hello…
You don't look like you're from Horteka…\e"
ME0030001,"\h(《Vyse》)We're not. Actually, we had to cross
the South Ocean to get here. 
My name's Vyse.\e"
ME0030002,"\h(《Hans》)Wow! You were able to cross the South Ocean? 
That's impressive.
My name is Hans. It's good to meet you.\e"
ME0030003,"\h(《Hans》)We're Blue Rogues under the command of Captain 
Centime. We had to crash land here after a 
hurricane knocked us off course.\e"
ME0030004,"\h(《Drachma》)Centime…
He's the Blue Rogue that takes in orphans and 
trains them.\e"
ME0030005,\h(《Drachma》)I also heard that he's a brilliant engineer.\e
ME0030006,"\h(《Hans》)Yeah, he was… 
I mean is. The Valuans kidnapped him and are 
forcing him to build weapons for them.\e"
ME0030007,"\h(《Hans》)We're staying here and working on the ship until
he returns.\e"
ME0030008,\h(《Fina》)Oh… I hope he returns soon… \e
ME0030009,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! 
Hans, I was wondering if you could help out some
fellow Blue Rogues…\e"
ME0030010,"\h(《Aika》)We burned all of our fuel crossing South Ocean.
Do you think you could spare a few Moon Stones?\e"
ME0030011,"\h(《Hans》)Of course. 
We've got plenty to spare… 
Here, take these.\e"
ME0030012,\h(　)You received the “Moon Stone Fuel.”\e
ME0030013,"\h(《Vyse》)Thanks! We owe you one.
You really helped us out a lot.\e"
ME0030014,"\h(《Hans》)You're welcome.
Well, I need to get back to work.
Good luck!\e"
M90080000,"\h(《Centime》)Ahh, hello, Mr. Vyse! Thanks to you, 
I was able to return to my family.\e"
M90080001,"\h(《Centime》)This is hardly an adequate expression of my 
gratitude, but perhaps you could use this.\e"
M90080002,\h(　)You received 1 “Twin Propellers.”\c
M90080014,"\h(《Centime》)I never would have been able to see my family 
again if it wasn't for you, Mr. Vyse.\c"
M90080003,"\h(《Centime》)Hello, Mr. Vyse! That sure was a fierce battle, 
wasn't it? It made my Air Pirate's blood tingle.\e"
M90080004,"\h(《Centime》)I have no desire to fight anymore except to 
protect my children.\e"
M90080005,"\h(《Centime》)But my son Hans seems to have adopted you as his
hero.\e"
M90080006,"\h(《Centime》)It won't be long now before Hans is all grown 
up. I imagine he'll be striking out on his own 
into the wild blue yonder sometime soon.\e"
M90080007,"\h(《Centime》)It won't be long now before Hans is all grown 
up. I imagine he'll be striking out on his own 
into the wild blue yonder sometime soon.\e"
M90080008,"\h(《Centime》)Well, hello, Mr. Vyse! Long time no see.\e"
M90080009,\h(《Centime》)I see you now have a ship of your own. \e
M90080010,"\h(《Centime》)The captain has an obligation to protect his 
ship and his crew. It's a weighty job. I wish 
you well.\e"
M90080011,"\h(《Centime》)The captain has an obligation to protect his 
ship and his crew. It's a weighty job. I wish 
you well.\e"
M90080012,"\h(《Centime》)Ahh, Mr. Vyse! Hans is very eager to see you. 
Please talk to him.\c"
M90080013,"\h(《Centime》)Please take good care of Hans, Mr. Vyse.\e"
M05090000,"\h(《Woman》)To judge from your appearance...I gather you 
came from over Ocean way?\e"
M05090001,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)My husband was too concerned about the children 
to put up any resistance to the Valuans, and he 
was taken away to work in the mines.\e"
M05090002,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)He smiled and told me not to worry, but I can't 
help it. I'm worried to death... \e"
M05090003,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)My husband was taken away to work in the Valuan 
mines. I'm worried to death about him... \e"
M05090004,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)Mr. Vyse! My husband has come back from the 
Valuan mines!\e"
M05090005,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)I understand you were the one who rescued him.
I can't thank you enough!\c"
M05090006,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)I understand you were the one who rescued him.
I can't thank you enough!\c"
M05090007,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)Oh, I'm so relieved, Mr. Vyse! I was afraid you 
might get hurt!\e"
M05090008,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)I was so scared! What in the world could it have
been? That giant?\c"
M05090009,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)I was so scared! What in the world could it have
been? That giant?\c"
M05090010,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)Well, hello there, Mr. Vyse. Long time no see.
Why don't you make yourself comfortable and stay
awhile.\e"
M05090011,"\h(《Centime's Wife》)Oh, Mr. Vyse! Hans is eager to see you. Please 
talk to him right away.\c"

M05100000,"\h(《Youth》)Hello. You don't seem to be from this town. 
Who are you?\e"
M05100001,"\h(《Hans》)I'm repairing ships here while I wait for my 
father to come home.\e"
M05100002,"\h(《Hans》)Hello, Mr. Vyse! Thank you so much for rescuing 
my father!\e"
M05100003,"\h(《Hans》)Mr. Vyse is really great. He barged his way into
the Valuan mines and rescued my father.\e"
M05100004,"\h(《Hans》)I'm learning from my father how to be a ship's 
engineer.\e"
M05100005,\h(《Hans》)Someday I'd sure like to work on your ship.\c
M05100006,"\h(《Hans》)Someday, I'd sure like to work on your
ship, Vyse. Perhaps if you ever need
an engineer…\c"
M05100007,"\h(《Hans》)Hello, Mr. Vyse! That was a really fierce 
battle, wasn't it!\e"
M05100008,"\h(《Hans》)The way you defeated the Armada and that 
giant… I was really amazed by what you did!\e"
M05100009,"\h(《Hans》)Someday I'd sure like to work as an engineer on 
your ship.\c"
M05100010,"\h(《Hans》)Someday I'd sure like to work as an engineer on 
your ship.\c"
M05100011,\h(《Hans》)Oh! Mr. Vyse! Hello!\e

Congratulations!\e"

but when my stint here is over… er… that is…\e"
M05100014,"\h(《Hans》)I wonder if you would be willing to take me on
as part of your crew? I'd like to be your ship's
engineer.\e"
M05100015,"\h(《What does Vyse say?》)“Of course, Hans.”
“Sorry, Hans, I don't think so.”\e"
M05100016,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course, Hans! It'd be great to have you 
aboard!\e"
M05100017,"\h(《Hans》)Really, Mr. Vyse? I can be your engineer? Thank
you very much. I'm so excited to be working with
you!\e"
M05100018,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, Hans, I don't think so. I think your
family probably needs you to stay.\e"
M05100019,"\h(《Hans》)Oh, not at all, sir. My dad and my mom and my 
little brothers have all said I could go.\e"
M05100020,"\h(《Hans》)My father taught me well, and I know I'll be a 
good engineer. Please, Mr. Vyse!?\e"

M05100028,\h(　)Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M05110000,\h(《Boy》)Who are you? My father's not here.\e
M05110001,"\h(《Boy》)Most of the people in this village seem to be 
afraid of us or something and they always stay 
away from us.\e"
M05110002,"\h(《Boy》)But this girl's our friend. She's teaching us
how to dance.\c"
M05110003,"\h(《Boy》)This girl's our friend. She's teaching us how to

M05110004,\h(《Boy》)Daddy Centime is home!\e

free, Mr. Vyse. Thank you!\e"

to us ever since the captives came home.\e"
M05110007,"\h(《Boy》)They come and talk with us now, and they 
sometimes bring us fruit and other things to 
eat.\c"
M05110008,"\h(《Boy》)Oh, Mr. Vyse! Hello!\e"

M05120000,\h(《Boy》)Who are you?\e
M05120001,"\h(《Boy》)We were orphans, but then Daddy Centime adopted 
us.\e"
M05120002,\h(《Boy》)Our real mommy and daddy are dead… \e
M05120003,"\h(《Boy》)But we have Daddy Centime and Brother Hans so 
we're not lonely anymore.\e"
M05120004,\h(《Boy》)Daddy… I sure wish you'd come home soon…\c
M05120005,\h(《Boy》)Daddy Centime is home!\e
M05120006,"\h(《Boy》)You mean it was Mr. Vyse who defeated that huge,
green monster?\e"
M05120007,"\h(《Boy》)Wow! I can't believe it! Mr. Vyse is really 
great!\c"
M05120008,"\h(《Boy》)I saw Mr. Vyse coming this way in his fancy new 
ship! It's nothing like our old beater!\e"
M05120009,"\h(《Boy》)But, you know, I kind of like my dad's old 
beater!\e"
M05120010,"\h(《Boy》)Please tell Brother Hans that we're all well and
doing fine.\e"
M05120011,"\h(《Boy》)What? There's another country to the west of 
here? I don't believe you!\c"
M05130000,\h(《Girl》)…Who are you?\c
M05130001,"\h(《Girl》)Everyone says that I shouldn't play with the 
Easterners… That I mustn't play with Centime's 
kids.\e"
M05130002,"\h(《Girl》)But… they're all very nice. I don't know why 
everyone doesn't want me to play with them…\e"
M05130003,"\h(《Girl》)Please… Centime, come home soon…\e"
M05130004,"\h(《Girl》)Please… Centime, come home soon…\e"
M05130005,\h(《Girl》)Centime came home. I'm so happy!\e
M05130006,"\h(《Girl》)Now everyone says it's okay to play with Centime
and his family!\e"
M05130007,\h(《Girl》)Is Hans well? I'm happy if Hans is happy!\e
M05130009,"\h(《Girl》)Everyone in the village finally said I can play 
with Centime and the other children. I'm so 
happy…\c"
M05130008,\h(《Girl》)The forest… it's restless… I'm so scared…\e
Ms010b000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a white bedsheet. Hm… It's a little faint,
but it looks like there's a yellow stain here.
Looks like someone had an accident… hehe…\c"
Ms010b001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a box of tools and various ship parts.
It must be great to be able to keep everything
this organized…\c"
Ms010b002,"\h(《Vyse》)There's some drinking water and preserved foods.
This must be from the ship's supply storage.\c"
Ms010b003,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… Parts from all kinds of different ships
have been used in rebuilding this thing.\e"
Ms010b004,"\h(《Vyse》)It must take a lot of skill to build something
with such a random selection of parts…\c"
Ms010b005,"\h(《Vyse》)All the repair methods and replacement
parts are listed in amazing detail.
Talk about organized!\c"
Ms010b006,"\h(《Vyse》)Ha ha ha…
They're using their mast as a clothesline.
Very creative.\c"
