MAC000000,"\h(《Would you like to try again?》)“I never give up!”
“I quit.”\c"
MA5220000,"\h(《Gregorio》)Prince Enrique…
Please forgive me for taking up arms against
you, but you leave me no choice.\e"
MA5220001,"\h(《Gregorio》)I will not allow you to escape! You will
not get passed the Auriga!!\c"
MA5220002,"\h(《Enrique》)As I stated before, Gregorio has been nicknamed
“Ironwall” by his peers. He is the Armada's best
defense tactician…\e"
MA5220003,"\h(《Enrique》)I have heard that he sets up a tight defense
and waits for his enemy to make even the
smallest mistake. It is then that he attacks.\c"
MA5220004,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't believe it! He just rammed us
with his entire ship! He's crazy!!\e"
MA5220005,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, watch out! He's not letting up on
the cannon fire, either!\c"
MA5220006,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn… We need to do something
about that ram attack…\c"
MA5220007,"\h(《Enrique》)Only Gregorio's heavily armored Auriga can
pull off an attack like that…\e"
MA5220008,"\h(《Aika》)Maybe we can dodge his attack if we can
somehow increase our speed…\e"
MA5220009,"\h(《Fina》)Perhaps we could increase our speed
with magic or some other method
before he tries to ram us?\c"
MA5220010,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah! We dodged his ram attack!
Now he's gonna pay…\e"
MA5220011,"\h(《Aika》)The enemy vessel's wide open!
Let 'em have it, Vyse!\c"
