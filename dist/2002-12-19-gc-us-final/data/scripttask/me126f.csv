MK0060000,"\h(《Galcian》)Admirals, the five Crystals are now in our 
possession. The day of our domination over the 
world is drawing near.\e"
MK0060001,"\h(《Ramirez》)My Lord, if you will excuse me. I must go to the
place of which we spoke and finish the final 
preparations.\e"
MK0060002,"\h(《Vigoro》)Wow, Galcian, I'm impressed. You destroyed 
Vyse's base and retrieved the Crystals… 
Sounds like it's all under control.\e"
MK0060003,\h(《Vigoro》)I'll be at my ship awaiting further orders… \e
MK0060004,\h(《Belleza》)……\e
MK0060005,"\h(《Galcian》)…What is the matter, Belleza?
You look like you have something on your mind. 
Share it with me.\e"
MK0060006,\h(《Belleza》)……\e
MK0060007,"\h(《Belleza》)Admiral Galcian… 
Please reconsider… \e"
MK0060008,"\h(《Belleza》)If we call down the Rains of Destruction, 
so many innocent lives will be lost.\e"
MK0060009,"\h(《Belleza》)Please…
We… we don't need to raise Soltis…\e"
MK0060010,"\h(《Galcian》)Belleza…
Will you betray me as Gregorio did?\e"
MK0060011,"\h(《Belleza》)No!
I have no intention of ever betraying you, 
my lord.\e"
MK0060012,\h(《Belleza》)Because… I… \e
MK0060013,"\h(《Galcian》)Good.
I do not wish to fight an unnecessary battle.\e"
MK0060014,"\h(《Galcian》)As long as Valua does not resist, there should 
be no reason to use the Rains of Destruction.\e"
MK0060015,\h(《Belleza》)Admiral Galcian… what should I do?\e
MK0060016,"\h(《Galcian》)I do not see Alfonso anywhere.
He is probably on his way to inform Her Majesty
of my betrayal.\e"
MK0060017,"\h(《Galcian》)Belleza, I want you to return to the Imperial 
Palace and remind the Empress of my loyalty to
Valua. Wait by her side, until further orders.\e"
MK0060018,"\h(《Galcian》)Trickery is your specialty.
Now, you can use your abilities to stop 
unnecessary bloodshed.\e"
MK0060019,"\h(《Belleza》)…Yes, my lord.
I will leave right away.\e"
MK0060020,"\h(《Galcian》)Heh heh heh…
Farewell Belleza, you have served me well… \e"
