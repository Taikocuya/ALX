MF0160000,"\h(《Owner of the Inn》)It will cost you 10 gold to stay for the night.
Would you like to stay?\e"
MF0160001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“We'll come back later!”
“Let's stay the night here!”\e"
MF0160002,"\h(《Aika》)We're not quite ready to sleep right now. 
We'll be come later!\e"
MF0160003,"\h(《Aika》)Sounds great!
Well, actually, could you do us a favor?\e"
MF0160004,"\h(《Aika》)We're planning on staying for a while, so would 
it be alright if we paid you when we check out?\e"
MF0160005,"\h(《Owner of the Inn》)No problem.
In that case, go ahead and use the room upstairs
and down the hall.\e"
MF0160006,"\h(《Aika》)Looks like we're going to be stuck in Nasrad for
a little while.\e"
MF0160007,\h(《Fina》)What are we going to do tomorrow?\e
MF0160008,"\h(《Aika》)Well, I was thinking about looking for a place 
to work. We have to save up some gold.\e"
MF0160009,"\h(《Aika》)Let's put aside the money that we got from 
Clara. If we save up some more, we can buy 
a small ship and go looking for Vyse.\e"
MF0160010,"\h(《Aika》)What do you think, Fina?\e"
MF0160011,"\h(《Fina》)Yes!
That sounds like a good plan.\e"
MF0160012,"\h(《Aika》)Well, tonight let's just get some rest and hope 
for the best!\e"
MF0160013,"\h(《Aika》)But I wonder where Vyse is, though…\e"
MF0160014,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse…
I wonder if you're looking at the same moon 
right now…\e"
MF0220000,"\h(《Owner of the Inn》)It's 10 gold for a night.
Would you like to stay?\e"
MF0220001,"\h(《What shall we do?》)“We'll be back later.”
“We'll stay here.”\e"
MF0220002,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… I think we're going to look around town a 
little bit more. We'll back a little later.\e"
MF0220003,"\h(《Vyse》)We'll stay here.
Oh, I have one more person with me, so we'll 
need a room for two.\e"
MF0220004,"\h(《Owner of the Inn》)That's quite alright.
You can use first room at the top of the stairs.\e"
MF0220005,"\h(《Vyse》)This looks like the room.
I guess I just have to wait for Gilder here.\e"
MF0220006,"\h(《Aika》)It's payday!!!
Working as a waitress was actually more fun 
than I thought!\e"
MF0220007,"\h(《Fina》)I… I've never worked for gold before. 
It's… it's rather exciting actually.\e"
MF0220008,"\h(《Aika》)With the rest of our pay, we'll finally have the
10,000 gold we need to buy a ship! 
Let's stop by the tavern and pick up our gold!\e"
MF0230000,"\h(《Aika》)Sir!
What's wrong?!
Do you need help?\e"
MF0230001,"\h(《Old Man》)Ugh…
Starving… Thirsty…
Need water… Need food…\e"
MF0230002,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, just hang on.
I'll bring you inside, we'll take care of you.\e"
MF0230003,"\h(《Old Man》)Thank you for your kindness.
My name is Pedro. 
I'm not sure how I can repay you.\e"
MF0230004,"\h(《Aika》)That's quite alright. Don't give it another 
thought. Helping people in distress is what we 
Blue Rogues live for.\e"
MF0230005,"\h(《Pedro》)Oh…!
You're an Air Pirate?\e"
MF0230006,"\h(《Pedro》)I can't do much to repay you, but please accept 
this…\e"
MF0230007,"\h(《Aika》)What's this?
It looks like an old map…\e"
MF0230008,"\h(《Pedro》)I, I used to be a sailor.
I used to travel with my friend, Gonzales…\e"
MF0230009,"\h(《Pedro》)One day, we were lucky enough to find this… 
“Daccat's Map.”\e"
MF0230010,\h(《Fina》)Daccat's… Map?\e
MF0230011,"\h(《Pedro》)About 5 generations ago, long before my time… 
There was a great Air Pirate named Daccat that 
terrorized the world.\e"
MF0230012,"\h(《Pedro》)And this map supposedly shows where Captain
Daccat hid all of his treasures… 
“Daccat's Island.”\e"
MF0230013,"\h(《Aika》)But, half of the map is missing!\e"
MF0230014,"\h(《Pedro》)Well, Gonzales and I promised each other to look
for it together someday…\e"
MF0230015,"\h(《Pedro》)We tore the map in half and we each carried a 
piece with us.\e"
MF0230016,"\h(《Pedro》)Right after we found the map, we were attacked
by Black Pirates.\e"
MF0230017,"\h(《Pedro》)We had to abandon ship.
I don't know what happened to Gonzales, but I 
ended up here in Nasrad.\e"
MF0230018,"\h(《Pedro》)I've been waiting for him in this town for a 
very long time… I don't think I'll ever see him
again.\e"
MF0230019,\h(《Fina》)That's very sad…\e
MF0230020,"\h(《Pedro》)Now I am too old to be going off looking 
for buried treasure.\e"
MF0230021,"\h(《Pedro》)I'm sure that Gonzales would have been happy if
you found the treasure…\e"
MF0230022,"\h(《Pedro》)…Thank you for saving me.
Good luck finding that treasure.\e"
MF0230023,"\h(《Aika》)Fina, what do you think? 
Do you think this map is worth anything?\e"
MF0230024,"\h(《Fina》)Hmm…
He didn't appear to be the kind of person that 
would lie.\e"
MF0230025,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah, that story did seem a little farfetched, 
but it might be worth checking out.\e"
MF0230026,"\h(《Aika》)Hey…
Do you want to go searching for the treasure?\e"
MF0230027,"\h(《Fina》)Sure, I would like that very much.
It sounds interesting.\e"
MF0230028,"\h(《Aika》)Sounds like a plan. 
Let's pay the innkeeper and get going!\e"
MF0230029,"\h(《Gilder》)Why hello there. Do you want to grab a bite to 
eat? I have a friend that can come along too.\e"
MF0230030,"\h(《Aika》)We'd love to, but we're about to go on a trip. 
Maybe some other time.\e"
MF0230031,"\h(《Gilder》)I see. Well, that's too bad.
Safe travels.\e"
MF0230032,\h(《Aika》)Thank you. Maybe we'll run into you later.\e
MF0230033,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, we just got into town, and you've got your 
face buried in that map. 
Have a little fun, will ya?\e"
MF0230034,\h(《Gilder》)Hey! Where'd you get that map?!\e
MF0230035,\h(《Vyse》)I found it on that deserted island I was on. \e
MF0230036,"\h(《Gilder》)That's the map to the hidden treasure of the 
legendary Air Pirate, Daccat!\e"
MF0230037,"\h(《Gilder》)It is said that he traveled the world and has 
seen all six Moons with his own eyes.\e"
MF0230038,"\h(《Gilder》)And it is also said that all the treasures that 
he accumulated on his adventures are hidden 
somewhere on a small island.\e"
MF0230039,"\h(《Gilder》)And this is a map of that island.
Vyse… you certainly know how to pick your maps!\e"
MF0230040,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm…
But how do we know it's real?\e"
MF0230041,"\h(《Gilder》)Look… it's Daccat's seal. 
It isn't easy to duplicate that seal.\e"
MF0230042,"\h(《Gilder》)It's no fake, Vyse.
This is a real treasure map!\e"
MF0230043,"\h(《Gilder》)We can't just sit here…
We have to leave right away!\e"
MF0230044,"\h(《Vyse》)But Gilder, didn't you say something about 
meeting women and having some fun?\e"
MF0230045,"\h(《Gilder》)Which do you think is more important? Women? Or 
Daccat's Treasure? Besides, with Daccat's 
Treasure, we'll be able to get more women.\e"
MF0230046,"\h(《Gilder》)C'mon, Vyse… let's go!\e"
MF0230047,\h(　)You received “Pedro's Map.”\e
MF0240000,\h(《Nasr Soldier》)Halt!\e
MF0240001,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)This is the Royal Palace of the Nasultan! If you
do not have official business, then you are not 
welcome here.\e"
MF0240002,\h(《Vyse》)Nasultan?\e
MF0240003,"\h(《Gilder》)The rulers of Nasr always take on the title of 
Nasultan. And this is the Royal Palace.\e"
MF0240004,"\h(《Vyse》)I see. 
So, we should tell this “Nasultan” guy 
about Valua's plan to attack.\e"
MF0240005,"\h(《Vyse》)Please… 
We must speak to the Nasultan right away. 
Let us through.\e"
MF0240006,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)What?! You wish to speak to the Nasultan? Do you
think we allow commoners into the Royal Palace?\e"
MF0240007,"\h(《What will you say?》)“We have important information.”
“You'd better let us through, or else!”\e"
MF0240008,"\h(《Vyse》)I have important information regarding the 
Valuan Armada. Please let us pass.\e"
MF0240009,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)Important information about the Valuans?
Hmm…\e"
MF0240010,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)Valua is our greatest enemy. If you have 
information about them, then perhaps we can let
you speak to the Nasultan.\e"
MF0240011,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)Very well, I will grant you permission to enter
the Royal Palace. Now, if you will follow me.\e"
MF0240012,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh, not too shabby, kid. Who'd have thought 
that two ruffians like us would be able to meet
the Nasultan?\e"
MF0240013,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I just figured that if they knew we were
doing them a favor, they'd let us in.\e"
MF0240014,"\h(《Vyse》)If you don't want to get hurt, you'll let us 
through.\e"
MF0240015,\h(《Nasr Guard》)What did you say?!\e
MF0240016,"\h(《Gilder》)Now, now… calm down, everyone.\e"
MF0240017,"\h(《Gilder》)Mister uhhh… Guard, this here is Captain Vyse, 
the only Air Pirate to have ever broken out 
of the Grand Fortress.\e"
MF0240018,"\h(《Gilder》)If you don't let him pass, you'll learn to
regret it later. Is that something you want
on your shoulders?\e"
MF0240019,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)What? He's the Air Pirate that escaped the Grand
Fortress?\e"
MF0240020,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)My… my apologies!
I didn't… I didn't know that I was speaking 
to a legend! Forgive me…\e"
MF0240021,"\h(《Nasr Guard》)Just a moment!
I… I will announce your arrival!\e"
MF0240022,\h(《Vyse》)Gilder…\e
MF0240023,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh… I'm good at this sort of stuff.
Leave it up to me.\e"
MF0240024,"\h(《Nasultan》)So you're the Air Pirate who escaped from the 
Grand Fortress, eh? I am the Nasultan of the 
Nasr Kingdom. What is it that you want from me?\e"
MF0240025,"\h(《Vyse》)Valua is planning an attack on Nasrad. 
They are already organizing their forces.\e"
MF0240026,"\h(《Vyse》)You should warn your people and assemble your
fleet right away!\e"
MF0240027,"\h(《Nasultan》)HAHAHAHAHA!!!
You came all this way to tell me this?\e"
MF0240028,"\h(《Nasultan》)Do not fear, our navy is powerful enough to 
crush the Valuan Armada.\e"
MF0240029,"\h(《Vyse》)But, Your Majesty… you shouldn't underestimate 
them. You need to assemble your fleet or 
many innocent lives may be lost.\e"
MF0240030,"\h(《Nasultan》)HAHAHAHA!!!
You seem very concerned about Nasr for 
an Air Pirate.\e"
MF0240031,"\h(《Nasultan》)Nasrad is shielded by mountains in the south and
sky rifts to the east. It is impossible for them
to invade.\e"
MF0240032,"\h(《Nasultan》)If they were to try and invade us, it would have
to be from the north. And that is where our 
fleet is located.\e"
MF0240033,"\h(《Nasultan》)The South Dannel Strait is properly guarded and 
the maelstrom blocks off the North Dannel 
Strait.\e"
MF0240034,"\h(《Nasultan》)In other words, it would be impossible for 
anyone to invade us! Hahahaha!\e"
MF0240035,\h(《Vyse》)But…\e
MF0240036,"\h(《Nasultan》)Do not worry… Nasr is protected by the Red
Moon. Valua cannot touch us.\e"
MF0240037,"\h(《Nasultan》)And besides, if someone as young as you can get
past the Armada perhaps they're losing their 
edge.\e"
MF0240038,"\h(《Nasultan》)Imagine that… The once mighty Valuan Armada 
fooled by a boy! 
Hahahahaha!!!\e"
MF0240039,"\h(《Gilder》)It's no use, Vyse. I don't think he'll listen to
anything we have to say. Let's stop wasting our
time and get to looking for Daccat's Island.\e"
MF0240040,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't know. He seems way too overconfident, 
but I hope for his sake that he's right. 
C'mon, let's go.\e"
MF0290000,"\h(《Aika》)I was hoping to find a bunch of gold so I could 
buy a big ship…\e"
MF0290001,"\h(《Fina》)Haha…
If we all work together, perhaps you will still 
be able to buy one, Aika.\e"
MF0290002,\h(《Gilder》)… Huh?\e
MF0290003,\h(《Aika》)It's the Armada!!!\e
MF0290004,\h(《Vyse》)How'd they get here?\e
MF0290005,\h(《Vyse》)The Royal Palace!\e
MF0290006,"\h(《Gilder》)Looks like they're trying to make an example out
of Nasr.\e"
MF0290007,"\h(《Gilder》)Vyse, if we just stand around here, we're all 
dead. Head for the docks!\e"
M06020000,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey there… how goes the sailing? I have cannons
for all your destructive needs! Feel free to 
take a look!\e"
M06020001,"\h(《Aika》)Well… um… actually… we don't even have our
own ship right now…\e"
M06020002,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)So what are you doing here… window shopping?
I don't like window shoppers…\c"
M06020003,\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)No window shopping allowed!!\c
M06020004,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey there… how's the sailing going?
Perhaps you'd like to buy a huge cannon to blow
your enemies out of the sky?\e"
M06020005,"\h(《Vyse》)Well… we don't actually have our own ship right
now, so there's really no point in us buying
anything…\c"
M06020006,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)So what are you doing here… window shopping?
I don't like window shoppers…\c"
M06020007,\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)No window shopping allowed!!\c
M06030000,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Welcome to the Sailors' Guild. We pay very well
for information on Discoveries!\e"
M06030001,"\h(《Aika》)We have no money and no ship… I don't think we
have time to look for Discoveries…\e"
M06030002,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hm… That may be a problem.
If you have no money, you can always go to the 
moneylender and borrow some.\e"
M06030003,"\h(《Guildmaster》)There's a moneylender here in this town named
Osman. Just look for the building with a picture
of a pink cat.\c"
M06030004,"\h(《Guildmaster》)There's a moneylender here in this town named
Osman. Just look for the building with a picture
of a pink cat.\c"
M06030005,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Welcome to the Sailors' Guild. We pay very well
for information on Discoveries!\e"
M06030006,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell Discoveries information.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06030007,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Actually, there was a cute girl that just came
by here saying that she didn't have any money or
a ship, either.\e"
M06030008,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I told her to go talk to the money lender,
Osman… I wonder if she's doing alright…\e"
M06030009,"\h(《Guildmaster》)You have the Treasure Map of Daccat?
I wonder what it will look like this time!\e"
M06030010,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I have over 100 versions of the Treasure Map of
Daccat! Heh… I have never actually seen the
real one yet.\c"
M06030011,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Every major port city has an office branch of
the Sailors' Guild. Make sure you stop on by.\c"
M06230000,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Welcome! This inn is 240 gold a night.
Would you like a room?\e"
M06230001,"\h(《Aika》)Um… We've actually been shipwrecked and we have
no money. I'm trying to find a way to raise
money, but…\e"
M06230002,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Bah… You girls look like good kids.
I trust you. I will start a tab, and you two can
settle it when you leave, okay?\e"
M06230003,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06230004,"\h(《Innkeeper》)You can use the room all the way in the back on
the second floor. I hope you sleep well.\c"
M06230005,"\h(《Innkeeper》)I see.
Well, do not push yourselves too hard.
If you tire, come back here and rest.\c"
M06230006,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Welcome back!
I bet you're tired…\e"
M06230007,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Welcome! This inn is 240 gold a night. 
Would you like a room?\e"
M06230008,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06230009,"\h(《Innkeeper》)You can use the room at the top of the stairs on
the second floor. I hope you sleep well.\c"
M06230010,"\h(《Innkeeper》)I trust you slept well.
May the Red Moon light your way.\c"
M06230017,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Hm? It appears that you lack enough gold. I am
very sorry, but you will have to come back later
when you have saved up a little more.\c"
M06230018,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh… damn.
I don't even have enough money to get a room.\e"
M06230019,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh well… I guess you can get the money from my
friend who should be coming by later. His name 
is Gilder and he's wearing red clothing.\e"
M06230020,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Oh, you are Gilder's friend? He comes here
often. Do not worry about it… I trust you. I 
will ask him for the money later.\e"
M06230021,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Go ahead and use the room directly at the top of
the stairs. I hope you enjoy your stay here in
Nasrad.\c"
M06230011,"\h(《Innkeeper》)I see.
Well, try not to push yourselves too hard.
If you tire, come back here and rest.\c"
M06230012,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Welcome back!
You must be tired.\e"
M06230013,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06230014,"\h(《Innkeeper》)You can use the room at the top of the stairs on
the second floor. I hope you sleep well.\c"
M06230015,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Did you sleep well? I wish you safe travels!
May the Red Moon light your way.\c"
M06230016,"\h(《Innkeeper》)I see.
Well, try not to push yourselves too hard. If 
you tire, come back here and rest.\c"
M06250000,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Welcome to Nasr's weapon store!
We offer the same mighty weapons that Nasr 
soldiers use!\e"
M06250001,"\h(《Aika》)Hm… I'd like to buy some, but I don't have any
money right now.\e"
M06250002,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Well, you cannot really buy anything then.
Sorry… But please come back when your purse is
a little heavier!\c"
M06250003,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Well, you cannot really buy anything then. 
Sorry… But please come back when your purse is
a little heavier!\c"
M06250004,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Welcome to Nasr's weapon store!
We offer the same mighty weapons that Nasr 
soldiers use!\e"
M06250005,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06250006,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Ha ha ha, you say Valua will attack? I have 
heard that Valuan forces have been unusually 
active lately.\e"
M06250007,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)But there is no way Valuan forces can ever break
through the Nasrean fleet. There is no way to
reach this city.\c"
M06250008,\h(《Weapons Merchant》)May the Red Moon be with you! Come again!\c
M06250009,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Welcome! This is the Arms Shop. We have all
sorts of weapons here. The quality is top
notch! Even the Nasr guards use my weapons!\e"
M06250010,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06250011,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Oh, hey! You girls work over at the tavern,
right? I have been there several times since you
two started.\e"
M06250012,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)What? You quit? That is unfortunate. You guys 
were starting to build up quite a little fan
club over there.\c"
M06250013,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Thank you very much!
I hope you come again!\c"
M06260000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Oh! Young lady!
You were the girl that…
It has been many moons.\e"
M06260001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)It is I… You and your friend escorted me to the
Nasr border a little while back.\e"
M06260002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Speaking of which, where is your friend?
You know, the one with the eye patch.
Are you not traveling with him anymore?\e"
M06260003,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, you mean Vyse?
Well… it's a long story, but we were separated.\e"
M06260004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Oh… I understand.
Perhaps you had a… um… difference of opinion.\e"
M06260005,"\h(《Aika》)Well, no… actually, that's not it.\e"
M06260006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)You do not have to pretend. It is said that the
closer you are to one, the more they make you
angry! Hahaha!\c"
M06260022,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Well, here… take this. I want you to have it.
Consider it a token of my gratitude.\e"
M06260023,\h(　)You received 1 “Abirik Cham.”\e
M06260024,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I thought that a Moon Stone shard as beautiful
as this would be fitting for ladies such as
yourselves.\c"
M06260007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)It is okay to fight, just be sure to make up
afterwards! Hahaha…\c"
M06260008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Oh, young lad! It has been quite a long time!\e"
M06260009,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)It is I, the merchant you helped to the border 
of Nasr!\e"
M06260010,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Well, I see you still are not traveling with

made up.\e"
M06260011,"\h(《Vyse》)Huh? Made up?
What are you talking about?\e"
M06260012,"\h(《Nasr Merchants》)Do not worry… I know, I know.
There is no need to hide a thing. Just be sure
to make up.\c"
M06260013,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)It is okay to fight, just be sure to make up 
afterwards! Hahaha…\c"
M06260014,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Oh, is it not the young lad with the eye patch? 
It has been a while!\e"
M06260015,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)It is I, the merchant that you escorted to the
Nasr border!\e"
M06260016,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Hm? I could have sworn that you were traveling
with a girl with braids when you escorted me
here…\e"
M06260017,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, yeah…
Well, it's a long story, but we were separated.\e"
M06260018,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Oh… I understand.
Perhaps you two got into an argument.\e"
M06260019,"\h(《Vyse》)N, no…
It's not like that, you see…\e"
M06260020,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I know, I know. You do not have to hide 
a thing. It is said that the closer you are to 
one, the more they make you angry! Hahaha…\c"

afterwards! Hahaha…\c"

I would like to buy something, but I don't have
any money right now…\e"

Well, please come back when you do!\c"

M06270006,"\h(《Item Merchant》)The Nasultan has many wives… and they all live
in the palace together.\e"
M06270007,"\h(《Item Merchant》)The Nasultan only worries when his wives argue 
with one another. He does not concern himself 
with the activities of Valua.\e"

And may the Red Moon guide your path!\c"
M06280000,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Welcome, young lady.
Please, come in and relax!\e"

M06280002,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Welcome, young lad.
Please, come in and relax!\e"
M06280003,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Heh… You are unlucky. Up until yesterday, I had
two very cute girls working here… but they
quit. Very unfortunate.\c"
M06280004,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Oh! It is you.
Here you are… this is your pay. You earned it.\e"
M06280017,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)You both worked very hard, so I decided to help
you out with a little extra bonus. Thank you for
everything!\e"

4 “Sacres Crystal” and 1 “Cham.”\e"
M06280005,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! Thanks! With this, we finally have the
10,000 gold that we need to buy a ship!\e"
M06280006,"\h(《Gilder》)Well, well! I didn't know you had such pretty
girls working here!\e"
M06280007,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Gilder, you scoundrel… Keep your hands off the 
help, okay?\e"
M06280008,"\h(《Gilder》)They just stopped working here, right?
You don't need to get so protective…\e"
M06280009,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Some things never change…
Gilder, you never were one to resist a pretty
face…\e"
M06280010,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Aika… Fina… Be careful out there! You better
take care of yourselves!\e"
M06280111,"\h(《Aika》)Thanks for everything!
Alright Fina, let's go back to the inn and
pay off our bill!\c"
M06280011,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)If you ever change your mind, you are more than
welcome to work here whenever you want!\c"

Please, sit down and relax!\e"

How have you ladies been? Please, relax and 
enjoy yourselves while you are here!\c"

M06290000,"\h(《Depressed Man》)I heard the Empress of Valua was once a
beautiful woman…\e"
M06290001,"\h(《Depressed Man》)But that Empress is nothing but a power hungry
old hag now. Even the prince ran away from her!\c"
M06290002,"\h(《Depressed Man》)Huh? Valua is launching an attack? Our border
guards will take care of them… We don't have
anything to worry about…\e"
M06290003,"\h(《Depressed Man》)But I heard that one of the admirals of the
Valuan Armada is a beauty.\c"
M06300000,"\h(《Sailor》)The loqua and food at this joint are pretty
good, but the problem is they lack pretty
girls.\e"

tavernkeep doesn't do much for my tired bones.\c"
M06300002,"\h(《Sailor》)Wait a minute! What happened to those two girls 
who were here before? Yoo-hoo… Where are you, 
pretty girls?\e"
M06300003,"\h(《Sailor》)A couple of real cute chicks work here usually,

shipwreck, so we need to buy a new one.\e"

terrifying! But you will have to excuse my 
asking… What will you offer as collateral?\e"

precious money! Be on your way! Be on your way!\c"

the right place… if I deem you worthy, that is.\e"
M06310021,"\h(《Aika》)Moneylender? Well… actually, we bought a small
ship to go looking for Vyse and Cap'n Drachma,
but I'm still a little worried.\e"
M06310022,"\h(《Aika》)I wish we had enough money to buy a real Air

Remove yourselves from my shop!
I do not deal with thieves!!!\e"
M06310024,"\h(《Osman》)I would never lend money to a thief! I would

Mid Ocean.\e"
M06330001,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)If Valua were to attack, it would no doubt come 
by way of one of those straits… Most likely 
the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M06330002,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)But the strait is constantly guarded by Nasr's 
best naval fleet. It is absolutely impenetrable.\e"
M06330003,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)What about the North Dannel Strait, you ask?
A turbulent sky rift makes that place a death
trap for ships.\e"
M06330004,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)A ship has not been built that could make it 
safely through the North Dannel, so there is no 
need to guard it at all.\c"
M06330005,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)The defenses of the city of Nasrad are 
flawless. We have absolutely nothing to fear 
from Valua's scrap heap of a naval fleet!\c"

second to Valua!\c"
M06420000,"\h(《Nasr Soldier》)Behold, our beautiful capital! No two cities

Valua's slag heap of a town!\e"

let the likes of Valua lay a single finger upon 
our fair city!\c"

goods that have been brought here from all over
the world.\e"

cannot live without! And he is so sweet, he buys

Valua way lately. I wonder if we are going to

I do not think they will ever actually reach
this city.\c"

oasis known as the City in the Sand.\e"

It all sounds so good…\c"
Ms013b042,"\h(《Aika》)Valuan loqua, huh?
I bet it's hard to get Valuan loqua here in
Nasr, so it's probably really expensive.\c"
Ms013b043,"\h(《Aika》)This sieve's cute!
It looks pretty sturdy, too. I want one!\c"
Ms013b044,"\h(《Aika》)It's a model of the Nasr royal palace!
Whoever built this must be an excellent artist!
I wish I could make something like this!\c"
Ms013b045,"\h(《Aika》)“Nasr Dance Lessons:
Learn the traditional dances of the desert”
Um… I really don't think I have the time.\c"
Ms013b046,"\h(《Aika》)“Observation tower above. Leave your handprint!”
I wonder if I can get a view of all of Nasrad
from up there?\c"
Ms013b047,"\h(《Aika》)How beautiful!
There's flowers floating in the fountain!\e"
Ms013b048,"\h(《Fina》)I don't think it's very polite
to walk into other people's
rooms, Aika.\e"
Ms013b149,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, sorry!
Yeah, I shouldn't just barge in.
Bad habit!\c"
Ms013b049,"\h(《Aika》)This compass looks pretty old.
Vyse loves looking at
stuff like this…\c"
Ms013b050,"\h(《Aika》)It's a wanted poster.
Doesn't look like they have one for Vyse…
I don't know if that's good or bad…\c"
Ms013b051,"\h(《Aika》)“Navigator wanted…”
“Treasure map for sale…”
There's all kinds of postings here.\c"
Ms013b052,"\h(《Aika》)A night view of the royal palace, huh?
It's kinda romantic…\c"
Ms013b053,"\h(《Aika》)“A real drink for a real man!
A taste of the desert-- Khale-Relik Loqua!”
…Ugh. No thanks.\c"
Ms013b054,"\h(　)“Soft pastries made by our master chefs!
Perfect for a light snack, any time of the day!”
\c"
Ms013b055,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, this is one of those really expensive Nasr
rugs. There's no way I could afford one.\c"
Ms013b056,"\h(《Aika》)There's all kinds of spices. I bet that if I
could use all of these right, I'd be a really
good cook. I suppose that's a big IF, though…\c"
Ms013b057,"\h(《Aika》)There's some dried… stuff. What is this stuff,
anyway? I don't think I've ever seen anything
like this before…\c"
Ms013b058,"\h(《Aika》)Yaah!
…Oh, it's just a mannequin. It's wearing some
Nasrean clothes… It sure scared me, though.\c"
Ms013b059,"\h(《Aika》)Weapons and ammunition…
It's all piled here pretty randomly.\c"
Ms013b060,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what a nice sword! I wish I had the money
to buy it for Vyse… I'm sure he'd love
something like this…\c"
Ms013b061,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what an intricate treasure box!
Let's see what's inside…
Oops… It's locked. It won't open.\c"
Ms013b062,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, this vase looks expensive.
I'd better not touch it, just in case. Knowing
me, I'd probably drop it.\c"
Ms013b063,"\h(《Aika》)That's a pretty impressive safe!
It's got so many locks…
It's just screaming, “Open me!”\c"
Ms013b064,"\h(《Aika》)Hmm… Some sort of golden bird…
Maybe it's supposed to be good luck for business
or something.\c"
Ms013b065,"\h(《Aika》)What a cute cushion!
The cat on the lady's head must be the model.
She must really like cats.\c"
Ms013b066,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, I almost forgot…\e"
Ms013b067,"\h(《Vyse》)Before we head off looking for Daccat's Island,
I should warn the king about Valua's plans.\c"
Ms013b068,"\h(《Vyse》)What's up with this picture?
It looks like someone just
made random strokes with a brush!\c"
Ms013b069,"\h(《Aika》)It looks like random brushstrokes, but if you
keep looking at it, it starts looking like
something… I just can't figure out what…\c"
Ms013b070,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… It won't open.
I guess it's locked.\c"
Ms013b071,"\h(《Aika》)It won't open.
Is it locked or something?\c"
