MC0090000,"\h(《Imperial Guard》)Lord Galcian brings good news, Your Majesty.\e"
MC0090001,"\h(《Galcian》)Indeed I do… Your Highness…  
I am sure you will be pleased.\e"
MC0090002,"\h(《Galcian》)As you have requested, my forces have captured a
Silvite.\e"
MC0090003,"\h(《Teodora》)Ahhh…
Excellent work, Galcian.
You have yet to fail me.\e"
MC0090004,"\h(《Teodora》)So, this is what a Silvite looks like. 
Hmm… Such a beautiful girl. Her clothes are…
interesting… A nice specimen…\e"
MC0090005,"\h(《Teodora》)Today we have taken another step closer to our
main objective. Soon the Valuan Empire shall 
rule the world.\e"
MC0090006,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MC0090007,"\h(《Teodora》)You seem… sad, young one.
Why do you not rejoice with us? 
You shall witness our finest hour.\e"
MC0090008,"\h(《Teodora》)You have the knowledge that we seek. 
You can assist us.\e"
MC0090009,"\h(《Teodora》)Hahaha…
All who oppose us shall fall…
Their islands will be reduced to ash and dust.\e"
MC0090010,\h(《Teodora》)Anyone who stands in our way will be destroyed!\e
MC0090011,"\h(《Teodora》)And you, young one, shall help us…\e"
MC0090012,"\h(《Enrique》)Mother…
Ruling the world by force is not something that
I am sure I approve of.\e"
MC0090013,"\h(《Enrique》)An empire that does not listen to the plight of
its people is destined to fall…\e"
MC0090014,"\h(《Teodora》)Enrique, you still have much to learn. You 
cannot walk the path of an emperor and concern
yourself with the petty worries of the “people.”\e"
MC0090015,"\h(《Enrique》)But, Mother!\e"
MC0090016,"\h(《Teodora》)Now now, Enrique… I am building an empire for
you… Since you shall inherit the throne when I
pass on, you should pay more attention.\e"
MC0090017,"\h(《Teodora》)Well then, young lady!
I know that there are 6 Moon Crystals and that 
they have been scattered all over the world.\e"
MC0090018,"\h(《Teodora》)I also know that he who controls the Moon 
Crystals controls weapons of mass destruction… 
I believe your people refer to them as… Gigas! \e"
MC0090019,"\h(《Teodora》)When the Gigas are ours, we shall rule the 
world!!! Now, young lady... You will tell me 
where to find the Moon Crystals.\e"
MC0090020,\h(《Fina》)I will die before I tell you.\e
MC0090021,\h(《Teodora》)What did you say!?\e
MC0090022,"\h(《Fina》)You do not understand how powerful the Gigas 
really are.\e"
MC0090023,"\h(《Fina》)The Gigas were great weapons of destruction 
built by the Old World… they are more powerful 
than you can imagine.\e"
MC0090024,"\h(《Teodora》)And that is precisely why Valua must obtain 
these weapons.\e"
MC0090025,"\h(《Teodora》)Since we are the most powerful empire, we should
have full control over them. And once we have 
them, we shall rule the world!\e"
MC0090026,"\h(《Fina》)No!
Humans must never control the Moon Crystals and 
the Gigas ever again!\e"
MC0090027,"\h(《Fina》)Power hungry dictators like you are the reason
humans must never control them!\e"
MC0090028,"\h(《Teodora》)You dare insult me?! The Empress of the great 
Valuan Empire?! In my own palace?!? \e"
MC0090029,"\h(《Teodora》)Kill her! Kill her! Kill the little wench! 
Off with her head!\e"
MC0090030,"\h(《Enrique》)Mother! Think about what you are saying!
You cannot kill her, she's done nothing wrong!\e"
MC0090031,"\h(《Teodora》)Are you saying that this girl is innocent, 
Enrique… even after she insulted me so?!\e"
MC0090032,\h(《Teodora》)Kill her! Kill her now!\e
MC0090033,"\h(《Fina》)Please! You must believe me! The power of the 
Gigas is not to be underestimated!\e"
MC0090034,"\h(《Messenger》)Lord Galcian, I bring urgent news!
Someone has broken into the Coliseum and freed 
the Blue Rogues!\e"
MC0090035,"\h(《Galcian》)What?!
I am on my way.\e"
MC0090036,"\h(《Galcian》)Take the girl to the ship and bring her to the 
Grand Fortress immediately.\e"
MC0090037,"\h(《Imperial Guard》)Yes, Lord Galcian!\e"
MC0090038,"\h(《Galcian》)Your Majesty, I request permission to deploy the
Armada.\e"
MC0090039,"\h(《Galcian》)I will take the girl with me and she will guide 
me to the Moon Crystals.\e"
MC0090040,"\h(《Teodora》)Very well, then!
Use the power of the Armada and bring the 
Crystals to me!\e"
MC0090041,"\h(《Galcian》)Of course, Your Majesty.
However, I have but one humble request…\e"
MC0090042,"\h(《Galcian》)I would like to request that a new addition be 
made to our highest ranking officers…\e"
MC0090043,"\h(《Galcian》)I would like to recommend my Vice Captain, 
Ramirez, for the position.\e"
MC0090044,"\h(《Teodora》)Do as you wish.
In return, I want you to give me your word that
you will bring me those Crystals!\e"
MC0090045,"\h(《Galcian》)As you wish, Your Majesty.\e"
MC0090046,"\h(《Soldier》)You heard the Admiral…
Get up!\e"
MC0090047,\h(《Fina》)Ramirez?\e
MC0090048,"\h(《Imperial Guard》)Silence, wench!
You shall pay for your insolence!\e"
MC0090049,\h(《Fina》)Ugh…\e
MG0010000,"\h(《Teodora》)Well done, Galcian.
Nasr was our only enemy with a navy. 
Now we rule the skies unopposed.\e"
MG0010001,"\h(《Teodora》)Soon, the whole world will bow before the might
of Valua… And they will see me as their ruler.\e"
MG0010002,"\h(《Galcian》)Yes, Your Highness…\e"
MG0010003,"\h(《Teodora》)It is my understanding that the Silvite girl and
those Air Pirates had the Moon Crystals in their
possession when they were captured.\e"
MG0010004,"\h(《Teodora》)Bring the girl and the Crystals to me.
As for those Air Pirates…\e"
MG0010005,"\h(《Teodora》)I want them executed in Lower City. 
I want the people to witness their deaths… \e"
MG0010006,"\h(《Galcian》)I will personally see to it that everything goes
as you…\e"
MG0010007,\h(《Enrique》)Wait!\e
MG0010008,"\h(《Enrique》)Mother!
I just heard that our fleet destroyed Nasrad
while it was defenseless.\e"
MG0010009,"\h(《Enrique》)How could you… 
Why did you have to murder so many innocent
people?!\e"
MG0010010,"\h(《Enrique》)I know that we are acquiring more lands, but if
we use these brutal tactics, the people will
rise up and rebel against us.\e"
MG0010011,"\h(《Enrique》)Please, we've made our point… 
Pull our troops out of Nasr.\e"
MG0010012,"\h(《Teodora》)Silence, Enrique!\e"
MG0010013,"\h(《Teodora》)It is Valua's destiny to span across the world
and bask in the glory of the six Moons!\e"
MG0010014,"\h(《Teodora》)How do you expect us to conquer the world
without a little bloodshed?\e"
MG0010015,"\h(《Enrique》)But, Mother…\e"
MG0010016,"\h(《Teodora》)How can you expect to inherit the throne of the
empire I worked so hard to build. You're too
much of a coward! Remove yourself from my sight.\e"
MG0010017,\h(《Enrique》)…\e
MG0010018,\h(《Enrique》)Very well…\e
MG0010019,"\h(　)You have lost the “Red Moon Crystal” and the
“Green Moon Crystal.”\c"
MK0080000,"\h(《Teodora》)Thank you for informing me, Alfonso. You have 
done well.\e"
MK0080001,"\h(《Alfonso》)Of course… I am your loyal servant, Your 
Highness. And those personal matters of which I 
spoke…?\e"
MK0080002,"\h(《Teodora》)Hahahaha… Very well, Alfonso.
I shall grant you what you wish.\e"
MK0080003,\h(　)Mother!\e
MK0080004,\h(《Teodora》)Enrique?!\e
MK0080005,"\h(《Teodora》)You've finally come back!
So, at last… you've come to your senses and 
returned to us…\e"
MK0080006,"\h(《Enrique》)No, Mother… I have come to warn you of
impending danger.\e"
MK0080007,"\h(《Enrique》)Admiral Galcian has betrayed you and is planning
on taking over the world. We must try to stop 
him!\e"
MK0080008,"\h(《Teodora》)Yes, my boy, I know.
Alfonso here was kind enough to inform me of 
Admiral Galcian's plans.\e"
MK0080009,"\h(《Teodora》)It seems that he is gathering the Moon Crystals
in order to call down the Rains of Destruction.\e"
MK0080010,"\h(《Enrique》)What?!
So… that was his plan all along!\e"
MK0080011,"\h(《Enrique》)Mother, we must act quickly! We need to get all
of our people to shelter!\e"
MK0080012,"\h(《Teodora》)Enrique, please, calm yourself.
We must think of the situation at hand.\e"
MK0080013,"\h(《Teodora》)If we can get the Moon Crystals in our 
possession, our dreams of ruling the world will
come true at last!\e"
MK0080014,"\h(《Teodora》)I have made Alfonso the new Commander of the 
Valuan Armada and we shall fight Galcian.\e"
MK0080015,"\h(《Enrique》)Mother! This is not to be taken lightly! You 
can't… He's too powerful!\e"
MK0080016,\h(《Belleza》)…Your Highness?\e
MK0080017,"\h(《Alfonso》)Do not fear, Your Highness.
All of my failures up until this point were by 
Lord Galcian's orders.\e"
MK0080018,"\h(《Alfonso》)If I act on my own accord, I shall bring Galcian
to justice.\e"
MK0080019,\h(《Teodora》)Hahahaha… Good Alfonso… Good… \e
MK0080020,"\h(《Enrique》)…I see.
Very well, then. You leave me no choice… \e"
MK0080021,\h(《Teodora》)What?\e
MK0080022,"\h(《Teodora》)Enrique!
What are you doing?!\e"
MK0080023,"\h(《Enrique》)…Mother.
If you continue like this, you will destroy 
Valua!\e"
MK0080024,"\h(《Enrique》)I must do this… for my country… for my
people… \e"
MK0080025,\h(《Alfonso》)Aaahhh!!\e
MK0080026,"\h(《Teodora》)Enrique, sheath your sword at once!\e"
MK0080027,"\h(《Belleza》)Your Highness…
Please forgive me.\e"
MK0080028,"\h(《Teodora》)Belleza!
Enrique has been brainwashed by the Air Pirates!
He's gone mad!\e"
MK0080029,"\h(《Teodora》)Imprison him in the Grand Fortress until he 
comes to his senses!\e"
MK0080030,"\h(《Belleza》)Please! Your Highness, wait!
I, I…\e"
MK0080031,"\h(《Alfonso》)As the new commander of the Valuan Armada, 
I order you to take the prince to the Grand 
Fortress and lock him up.\e"
MK0080032,"\h(《Alfonso》)If you have any complaints, you can take them up
with the executioner when your head is resting 
on the block.\e"
MK0080033,\h(《Belleza》)Grr…\e
