MF0010000,"\h(《Fat Guy》)Cold Ocean starfish soup, Valuan chicken with
onion sauce, and a mountain of flying fish!\e"
MF0010001,"\h(《Fat Guy》)This is wonderful!
The ship that we hit yesterday really had some
great food on board!\e"
MF0010002,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Captain Gordo! 
A ship armed with a gigantic harpoon has been
sighted off the port side!\e"
MF0010003,"\h(《Gordo》)I see… good, good!
Another ship full of goodies is there for the
taking!\e"
MF0010004,"\h(《Gordo》)I'll take on anyone if I think they have good
food on board.\e"
MF0010005,"\h(《Gordo》)I really hope they have something that goes good
with fish… \e"
MF0010006,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! There's a ship heading right for us.
And they're Black Pirates.\e"
MF0010007,"\h(《Drachma》)I know that flag… It belongs to a pirate 
named Gordo. He's known as the Gourmet Pirate.
He attacks other ships and steals their food.\e"
MF0010008,"\h(《Drachma》)He rarely uses his cannons because he's afraid
he'll burn the food on the other ships.
He'll do anything for a good meal.\e"
MF0010009,"\h(《Drachma》)As far as Black Pirates go, he's a strange one. \e"
MF0010010,"\h(《Vyse》)You're telling me.
He's getting awfully close…\e"
MF0010011,"\h(《Aika》)They're boarding us! They're challenging us to
hand to hand combat.\e"
MF0010012,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, while they're here,
we might as well kick their butts…\e"
