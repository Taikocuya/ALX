MA5230000,"\h(《Aika》)Aaah!
That squid's huge!!
It's bigger than our ship!\e"
MA5230001,"\h(《Vyse》)I've heard stories about a giant squid…
But I never actually believed any of them.
Alright, everyone… battlestations!\c"
MA5230002,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! We're all awaiting your orders!
What should we do?\e"
MA5230003,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Maintain present course.”
“Swing around behind it!”\e"
MA5230004,"\h(《Vyse》)Maintain present course and speed.
It's too soon to make a move.\e"
MA5230005,"\h(《Fina》)It appears that the squid can attack
behind itself, so perhaps it may be best
to try and get beside it.\e"
MA5230006,"\h(《Aika》)Good thinking, Fina!
Alright then! Maintaining present course!!!\c"
MA5230007,"\h(《Vyse》)Now's our chance to make a move!
Swing the ship around and get behind it!\c"
MA5230008,"\h(《Vyse》)Way to go, everyone! That was easy!\e"
MA5230009,"\h(《Fina》)Um… Vyse? Correct me if I'm wrong, but from
what I've heard about squids, they are able to
shoot ink out from behind them, right?\e"
MA5230010,"\h(《Fina》)Well, I suppose that would mean that
we are actually at a disadvantage by
being behind it…\e"
MA5230011,\h(《Vyse》)Oh… Oops…\e
MA5230012,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!!! You're the captain around here! We're
counting on you to know these things! Alright,
everyone… brace for impact…\c"
MA5230013,"\h(《Aika》)Aaah! Doesn't that thing know when to
give up?! It's already lost one leg and
it's still attacking us!!!\e"
MA5230014,"\h(《Vyse》)That one tentacle alone could probably
feed us for a month…
What a waste…\c"
