"","\h(<Baltor>)Hahahaha!!!!
I am Baltor, notorious Black Pirate and bane to
all who sail the skies!\e"
"","\h(<Baltor>)Now, I shall teach you to tremble in fear before
the power of my ship, the Black Beard!
Gahahahaha!!!\c"
"","\h(<Drachma>)Listen up, boy!
At the top of the screen, a 3X3 grid will
appear. This is your input command screen.\e"
"","\h(<Drachma>)Think of it as a time gauge of sorts. Each turn
is divided into four parts.\e"
"","\h(<Drachma>)For each part of each turn, you, Aika, or I can
input one command.\e"
"","\h(<Drachma>)However, usin' cannons and such requires Spirit
points. If you don't have enough points, you
need to use the ”Focus” command.\c"
"","\h(<Drachma>)Every once in a while, you will see a column
with a ”C!” at the top of the grid.\e"
"","\h(<Drachma>)During that turn, you will have a tactical
advantage over your opponent. Concentrate all of
your firepower into that round.\e"
"","\h(<Drachma>)Also, certain turns have a different color shown
at the top.\e"
"","\h(<Drachma>)These are the turns in which your enemy is goin'
to unleash a powerful attack. Make sure to use
your ”Defend” command effectively.\c"
"","\h(<Baltor>)Humph! He's good…
Vyse! Turn hard to starboard! Let's try and
maneuver behind him!\c"
"","\h(<Aika>)… Something's not right, Cap'n. It looks like
he's preparing for something. I'm getting a bad
feeling about this…\e"
"","\h(<Drachma>)He looks like he's goin' to try to get behind
us. Most ships have their engines in the back
and that makes them more vulnerable from behind.\e"
"","\h(<Drachma>)But, if he tries to get behind us, in the
meantime, he'll be wide open. What do you want
to do, boy?\e"
"","\h(<Vyse>)Now's our chance!
He won't be expecting us to try and maneuver
around to his backside!\c"
"","\h(<Drachma>)Good job, boy!
His ship doesn't have any cannons in the back…
We've got a wide open shot at his engines.\c"
"","\h(<Vyse>)I don't want to act in haste. Let's see what he
does…\c"
"","\h(<Baltor>)Hahaha!!!
Fools! You've let me get behind you! Now, you
are mine!!\c"
"","\h(<Drachma>)Idiot! What the hell're you doin'?!
Now that he's behind us, he's got a wide open
shot at our engines!!\c"
"","\h(<Baltor>)That old ship's tough!!
I need to get behind it!\e"
"","\h(<Vyse>)Alright! We managed to get behind him! Now's our
chance to attack!\c"
"","\h(<Vyse>)Great… While I was sitting here twiddling my
thumbs he managed to get behind me! All hands,
prepare for impact!!!\c"
