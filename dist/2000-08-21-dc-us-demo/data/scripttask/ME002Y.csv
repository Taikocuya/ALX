M00070000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Hi, Vyse. 
I was able to come down here and talk to 
Captain Dyne. \e"
M00130000,"\h(《Owner of Weapon Shop》)He-he-he. Welcome welcome! 
We sell weapons and 
protective gear here. \e"
M00140000,"\h(《Owner of Tool Shop》)Welcome! 
This is the tool shop.
Buy whatever you need… \e"
M00160000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)I'm checking the quantity of
supplies, so the Albatross can be ready 
to leave the port at anytime. \e"
M00160001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)We use flag signals like this
so we don't have to go back to the 
ship each time we need to say something. \c"
M00160002,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Cannonballs… 20 shots left…
Drinking water… 10 barrels 
left. Hmmm…\c"
M00170000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)This is our - the Dyne 
Family's - secret port! \e"
M00170001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)The Air Pirate ship you see 
below is the Albatross. It's 
ready to set sail! \c"
M00170002,"\h(《Air Pirate》)If the Valuans try to invade
our sky, we'll disembark at 
once and destroy them! \c"
M00180000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)15 air pirates still
alive and a bottle of rum. 
All right! \e"
M00180001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Don't you think I sing well? 
It's a song that I always sing while I hoist 
up the anchor of the ship. \c"
M00180002,"\h(《Air Pirate》)15 Air Pirates still
alive, and a bottle of rum. 
All right! \c"
M00200000,"\h(《Lady Air Pirate》)Nothing beats a stiff drink after 
at the end of the day! \e"
M00200001,"\h(《Lady Air Pirate》)It’s especially tasty after a hard 
day of treasure-hunting and defeating 
Valuans! \c"
M00230000,"\h(《Dyne》)Oh, Vyse.
How is it going? \e"
M00230001,"\h(《Dyne》)The world is vast. There are 
many towns, many countries, 
and many sailors… \e"
M00230002,"\h(《Dyne》)And, the boundless sky
awaits you. \e"
M00230003,"\h(《Dyne》)Eventually, the day for you to venture 
into the sky will come. For now, there is 
nothing to do but wait for that day. \c"
M00230004,"\h(《Dyne》)Eventually, the day for you to venture 
into the sky will come. For now, there is
nothing to do but wait for that day. \c"

No ma'am, really… I can’t eat anymore… 
grumble grumble \c"
M01050000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Captain Dyne is so considerate

M01050002,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Bring me a pretty girl
along with the drinks! \c"
M07140000,"\h(《Old Air Pirate》)It is said that 
there is a strangely-shaped rock 
in the mountains somewhere on Sand Island.\e"
M07140001,"\h(《Old Air Pirate》)It’s no more than a rumor, but 
it wouldn’t hurt to look for it if 
you drop by Sand Island. \c"
M002d0000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a picture of our air 
pirate ship Albatross. \e"
M002d0001,"\h(《Vyse》)This is... Actually, I don't know what 
this is a picture of. Aika says it a balloon, 
but I think it's an octopus. \c"
M002d0002,"\h(《Vyse》)It's stuffed with my old 
man's cigar and books. \c"
M002d0003,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a picture of a storm.

raw materials for medicine. \c"

windmill on land, baggage is 
raised and lowered with this. \c"
