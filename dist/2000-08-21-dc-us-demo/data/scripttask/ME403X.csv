MC0010005,"\h(《Aika》)Phew, we made it through safely.
It feels almost like we passed
through some sort of checkpoint.\e"
MC0010006,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah.
We finally made it to Valua.
Now all we have to do is sneak in…\e"
MC0010007,\h(《Vyse》)…！\e
MC0010008,"\h(《Aika》)What…
What is that!?\e"
MC0010009,"\h(《Drachma》)That is the only
entrance to Valua…
It’s the “Grand Fortress”.\e"
MC0010010,"\h(《Drachma》)One must pass through that
fortress to enter the mountainous
lands of Valua. \e"
MC0010011,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
How did they ever make that?\e"
MC0010012,"\h(《Drachma》)In a battle with Nazr 20 years ago,
over 100 Nazr battleships
bombarded this fortress for days. \e"
MC0010013,"\h(《Drachma》)However, all the shells were
repelled by these walls. They are
literally “walls of iron”.\e"
MC0010014,"\h(《Aika》)Look!
Something has started to move!\e"
MC0010015,"\h(《Drachma》)The door of the fortress
opens once a day to allow
ships to pass through.\e"
MC0010016,"\h(《Drachma》)Cannons line the entire rear
wall. It was those cannons
wiped out the Nazr fleet.\e"
MC0010017,"\h(《Vyse》)Defense and offense rolled in one…
It’s an invincible fortress.\e"
MC0010018,"\h(《Aika》)So Fina and Captain Dyne
are being held in there…\e"
MC0010019,"\h(《Drachma》)Not a single air pirate caught by Valuan troops 
has ever escaped that fortress.\e"
MC0010020,"\h(《Drachma》)Although, it is said that there is one way to 
get out.\e"
MC0010021,\h(《Vyse》)A way?\e
MC0010022,"\h(《Drachma》)If executed, the corpse is thrown 
out of the fortress. That is
the only other way to get out.\e"
MC0010023,"\h(《Aika》)So the only free man
is a dead man… That's just great. \e"
MC0010024,"\h(《Vyse》)Haha… I love a good challenge! 
Makes me feel alive!\e"
MC0010025,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't you worry.  I will rescue everyone 
and escape Valua. I will get us all 
back out here no matter what!\e"
