“I quit.”\c"
MA5310000,"\h(《Fina》)Bluheim is the Blue Gigas.
It will most likely attack with wind and
wave attacks.\e"
MA5310001,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we don't have much time to think of a plan
at this point, so we'll just have to look for a
weakness as we fight it!\c"
MA5310002,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't believe how fast that thing is! I never
thought something so big could move so fast!\c"
MA5310003,"\h(《Enrique》)What an incredible blast of wind! It's blown
us completely off course!\e"
MA5310004,"\h(《Fina》)Watch out! Bluheim is preparing
its next attack!\e"
MA5310005,"\h(《Enrique》)This must be its strategy… Using that
burst of wind, it pushes its enemy
into position for its next attack.\e"
MA5310006,"\h(《Aika》)Unless we can do something to counter that wind
attack, we'll be helpless against this thing!
We need to try and think of a plan!!\c"
MA5310007,"\h(《Enrique》)We've been blown off course again!
Isn't there anything we can do
against this thing?!\e"
MA5310008,"\h(《Aika》)Hey… I've got an idea… Why don't we try
going into a defensive posture before it
attacks? It might just work…\c"
MA5310009,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright!
It didn't use its wind attack! Maybe it saw
us bracing ourselves!\e"
MA5310010,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah! It looks like we can stop it from using
the wind attack by defending ourselves!\e"
MA5310011,"\h(《Enrique》)Enough talk, everyone! Now is our chance!
Vyse, we await your commands!\c"
MA5310012,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright, we've withstood its wind attack again.
Now it's our turn to fight back!\c"
