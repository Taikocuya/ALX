MA0130008,"\h(《Aika》)Alright Vyse, let's get going.
The boat is on the upper dock, 
and it's ready to go!\e"
MA0150000,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Ahhh…
It looks like it's going to be another nice day
today. Not too windy…\e"
MA0150001,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Well, there's the bell…
Time to get to work…\e"
MA0150002,\h(《Ben the Lookout》)I gotta loosen up a little.\e
MA0150003,\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Huh?\e
MA0150004,\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Oh… oh no!\e
MA0150005,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Ships!!! Ships approaching!

That flag… 
It's Galcian's Flagship!\e"
MA0150010,"\h(《Ramirez》)Lord Galcian.
We've blasted the island with cannon fire and 
our troops have begun the invasion.\e"
MA0150011,"\h(《Galcian》)Good…
They seem very organized for a small village 
that is under siege.\e"
MA0150012,"\h(《Galcian》)I don't know who their leader is, but he's
seems very capable. Perhaps Alfonso was in
over his head.\e"
MA0150013,\h(《Ramirez》)…Perhaps.\e
MA0150014,"\h(《Galcian》)No matter, it appears the battle is over.
Retrieve the girl and bring her to me.\e"
MA0150015,"\h(《Galcian》)Capture the Air Pirates. We'll need to 
interrogate them when we return to Valua.
And be sure to destroy their ship as well…\e"
MA0150016,"\h(《Ramirez》)And if they resist, Lord Galcian? 
What does Your Excellency wish me to do if the 
situation arises?\e"
MA0150017,"\h(《Galcian》)I don't think they're foolish enough to resist. 
However, if something should happen…\e"
MA0150018,"\h(《Galcian》)Burn the village and kill them all. Let the 
bodies rot in the sun and leave one of our flags
to set an example for others who may defy us.\e"
MA0200000,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Oh! Welcome back, Vyse.\e"
MA0200001,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)So, you're Fina. It's very nice to meet you.\e"

we've had guests.\e"
MA0200004,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Well, I have to finish cooking dinner. Go 
outside and have some fun. I'll call you when 
it's ready.\e"
MA0200005,\h(《Aika》)Hey guys!\e
MA0200006,"\h(《Aika》)Sorry to have kept you waiting!
I was just fixing my hair.\e"
MA0200007,"\h(《Aika》)Hey… the sunset outside is beautiful. 
Why don't we go outside and check it out?\e"
MA0200008,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we still have some time before dinner… 
why not?\e"
MA0200009,"\h(《Aika》)Okay, great!
Come on! We can get a great view from up top on 
Lookout Island.\e"

I have to stop by my house for a second.\e"
MA0250001,\h(《Vyse》)Why? What's wrong?\e

Don't worry, I'll catch up with you guys in a 
few minutes! See you at your house!\e"
MA0260000,\h(《Vyse》)I wonder what this handkerchief is for?\e
MA0260001,"\h(《Vyse》)…Oh.
I think there's something underneath it.\e"
MA0260002,"\h(《Vyse》)(Oops… the handkerchief was there to cover this
hole in Aika's room…)\e"
MA0260003,\h(《Aika》)…?\e
MA0260004,"\h(《Aika》)Aaahhh!
Who's there?! 
Take that, you creep!\e"
MA0260005,"\h(《Vyse》)Ow!
My eye!\e"
MA0260006,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!
What are you doing!? 
Peeking into my room…!?\e"
MA0260007,"\h(《Aika》)You should be ashamed of yourself! 
I can't believe that you would spy on me like
that! Get out of here!\e"
MA0260008,"\h(《Vyse》)But… but…  I was just looking under this
handkerchief! I didn't know! You probably just
put it there to draw people's attention…\e"
MA0280000,"\h(《Aika》)Good morning, Fina!
Did you sleep well?\e"
MA0280001,\h(《Fina》)Yes. Thank you.\e
MA0280002,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, we'll be heading over to Shrine Island to

M00020000,"\h(《Alan》)Vyse, whenever I go sailing on a ship, I always
get sick… and sometimes I even throw up.\e"
M00020001,\h(《Alan》)Does that mean I can't become a sailor?\e
M00020002,"\h(《What will you say? 》)“Sure you can be a sailor!”
“Sorry, Alan…”\e"
M00020003,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure you can be a sailor! I used to get
airsick all the time when I was little.\e"
M00020004,"\h(《Vyse》)And after a while, you just sorta stop
throwing up. You're body gets used to it.\e"

many times it takes until I can become a sailor!\c"
M00020006,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry Alan… but you might not be cut out for
sailing. But hey, there's no reason you have to
become a sailor if it doesn't agree with you.\e"
M00020007,"\h(《Vyse》)You can build houses instead, or work in the
harbor… There're lots of fine, respectable
jobs that you can do on land!\e"
M00020008,"\h(《Alan》)Yeah, you're right! Thanks, Vyse.
I'll do my best to find what I'm good at!\c"

M00040005,"\h(《Fina》)I guess on your island, you live
with other animals…\e"
M00040006,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… yeah. I, I guess. You don't have pets
where you come from?\e"
M00040007,"\h(《Fina》)W, well, um… no. Not really. Is it that
unusual? I'm so sorry… It's just that

M00050000,"\h(《Martha》)Oh, hey there, Vyse. I heard that you guys
rescued a girl from the Valuans?\e"
M00050001,\h(《Vyse》)Yup. Let me introduce you to her…\e
M00050002,"\h(《Fina》)Hello, it's very nice to meet you. My name is
Fina. I, I'm very grateful for all the
hospitality everyone has been showing me…\e"
M00050003,"\h(《Marth》)Well, well… aren't you just the sweetest little
thing? Well, Fina, it's our pleasure. Just relax
and make yourself at home, okay?\e"
M00050004,"\h(《Martha》)Hehe… Nice catch, Vyse. I guess your work
has it's perks, huh?\c"
M00050005,"\h(《Martha》)Those Valuans must be a bunch of dirty
scoundrels to go chasing after such a
sweet girl like her.\c"
M00050006,"\h(《Martha》)Heh… That good-for-nothing husband of mine just
came home from another voyage today and where is
he now? At the tavern. I swear…\c"
M00050007,"\h(《Martha》)You kids are going to go looking for Moon
Stones? Well, bring back plenty… We'll
need them to keep warm during the cold season.\c"
M00060000,"\h(《Barbara》)It's every Air Pirate's dream to be a
“Swashbuckler.” But you have to do more
than sail to become one.\e"
M00060001,"\h(《Barbara》)You have to live as one… in both your actions
and your words. Only true Swashbucklers can
become great leaders.\c"
M00060002,"\h(《Barbara》)You have to live as one… in both your actions
and your words. Only true Swashbucklers can
become great leaders.\c"
M00060003,"\h(《Barbara》)Now, let me see… What shall I make for
dinner today?\c"
M00070000,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Hey there, Vyse. It's nice to be home again,
huh? Sometimes when we're out sailing for a
long time, I start to miss this old place.\e"
M00070001,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Aboard ship ain't bad either, but you really
have to come back to the island now and then
or your legs forget what solid ground is like.\c"
M00070002,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)The breeze here on the island is gentle and
cool. My whole body feels refreshed.\c"
M00070003,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Hey, Vyse. I hear you're going to Temple Island
to pick up Moon Stones.\e"
M00070004,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)To get to Temple Island, you need to sail
straight north of here. But, be careful…
there's all sorts of monsters out there.\e"
M00070005,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)One more thing… Not only are there Moon Stones
in this world, there are things called
“Moonberries.” They contain a lot of power.\e"
M00070006,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)By eating some, you will actually get stronger.
If you go to your status screen and select
“Super Moves,” you can learn new techniques.\c"
M00080000,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I'm cooking dinner right now, so perhaps you
could go for a walk or something.\e"
M00080001,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Vyse, if you're going to Temple Island,
I want you to take this with you. I've
included enough for both you and Aika.\e"
M00080002,\h(　)You received 2 “Sacres Crystals.”\e
M00080003,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)If you ever need to take a break, don't be
afraid to come back home and rest up. You
shouldn't push yourself too hard.\c"
M00080004,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Vyse, why don't you take a little rest? You
must be very tired. A little nap can work
wonders sometimes…\e"
M00080005,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Sure, I could use a little rest.”
“Nah… I'll be fine. I'm not that tired.”\e"
M00080006,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure, I could use a little rest. I was starting
to get a little tired…\e"
M00080007,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)No problem.
Sleep well, Vyse.\e"
M00080008,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)It looks like you rested well.
Becareful out there, okay?\c"
M00080009,"\h(《Vyse》)I'll be fine, mom. I'm not that tired.\e"
M00080010,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I see. Well, just be careful out there, okay?\c"
M00090000,"\h(《Jessica》)Everyone needs a place to go home to. Especially
sailors. It's always good to have a place to
rest their tired wings, you know?\e"
M00090001,"\h(《Jessica》)When you know that you have someone to go home
to and a warm bed waiting for you, it gives a
person a little extra strength, I suppose…\c"
M00100000,"\h(《Granny》)We're able to live the way we do,
thanks to the blessed Moons.\e"
M00100001,"\h(《Granny》)The Moons provide us with Moon Stones that keep
our ships flying and provide us with fuel for
fires to keep ourselves warm.\e"
M00100002,\h(《Granny》)We truly are blessed…\c
M00100003,\h(《Granny》)We truly are blessed…\c
M00100004,"\h(《Granny》)I hear that the Silver Moon has blessed us
again with gifts from the skies.\e"
M00100005,\h(《Granny》)We truly are blessed…\c
M00110000,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Hey there, Vyse! Would you like me to give you
a few pointers on hand to hand combat?\e"
M00110001,"\h(《What will you ask about?》)“Ask about combat tactics.”
“Ask about weapons.”
“No, it's okay.”\e"
M00110002,"\h(《Vyse》)Actually, could you teach me some combat
tactics? I think I need a few pointers…\e"
M00110003,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Okay! Well, the first thing you need to learn
how to use effectively in battle, is your
party's “Spirit.”\e"
M00110004,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)You can think of “Spirit” as your entire party's
fighting energy. You use it up whenever you cast
spells or use “Spirit Moves.”\e"
M00110005,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)During a battle, everyone in your group uses the
same pool of Spirit Points.\e"
M00110006,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)That means that you can have someone like…
let's say, Aika, for instance… “Focus” and gain
Spirit Points for the rest of the party.\e"
M00110007,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)… And then you, Vyse, can use those “Spirit
Points” to unleash a powerful “Spirit Move.”
Just remember, strategy is the key, here.\e"
M00110008,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)And another thing. You can use your “Spirit
Points” all you want. You will regain a little
bit at the beginning of every round.\e"
M00110009,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)So, go ahead and use your “Spirit Moves” as
often as possible. It will make your battles
much easier.\c"
M00110010,"\h(《Vyse》)Could you teach me a few things about weapons?
The weapons that we use are made from Moon
Stones, right?\e"
M00110011,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)That's right. And because of that, putting
different colored Moon Stones near your weapons
will change their properties.\e"
M00110012,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)A weapon modified by a Red Moon Stone has the
powers of fire, and a weapon modified with a
Yellow Moon Stone has the powers of lightning.\e"
M00110013,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)By knowing your enemies' weaknesses and choosing
the color of your weapon wisely, you may be able
to do greater damage to your enemies.\c"
M00110014,"\h(《Vyse》)No, it's okay. I think I know enough to
be alright.\e"
M00110015,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Heh, sure. I suppose the best way to learn is to
get into a real battle situation, anyway. Well,
I hope you actually do know what you're doing!\c"
M00120000,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)If you can learn to use your “Magic” and “Spirit
Moves” skillfully, your fights will become a
whole lot easier.\e"
M00120001,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)I can teach you the basics on how to use these
if you want…\e"
M00120002,"\h(《What will you ask about?》)“Ask about magic.”
“Ask about Spirit Moves.”
“No, it's okay.”\e"
M00120003,"\h(《Vyse》)Can you teach me anything about magic? From what
I can tell, it's essentially a kind of power
drawn directly from the different Moons, right?\e"
M00120004,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)I suppose that's the easiest way to put it. But,
one thing you need to remember is that the true
power behind magic is your party's “Spirit.”\e"
M00120005,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Spells only take up 1 MP every time you cast
one. However, each spell takes a different
amount of “Spirit Points” to cast.\e"
M00120006,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)So, it's safe to assume that the more
Spirit Points a spell requires, the
more powerful it is.\e"
M00120007,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)In other words, since you're going to  use 1 MP
to cast a spell anyway, you might as well cast
the spell that uses the most Spirit Points.\e"
M00120008,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Since your Spirit Points regenerate a little bit
at the beginning of each round, it's more
efficient to use as much as you can.\e"
M00120009,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Magic is divided into 6 different types. You can
gain experience in a type of magic depending on
what color of your weapon.\e"
M00120010,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)So, if you want to learn a specific color of
magic, you should change the color of your
weapon to that color.\c"
M00120011,"\h(《Vyse》)Can you teach me anything about “Spirit Moves?”
What exactly are they?\e"
M00120012,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)To put it simply, they are special techniques.
Some of them are attacks, some are defensive
techniques, and some can even heal your party.\e"
M00120013,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)But, unlike magic, “Spirit Moves” are unique to
each person. Also, they don't use up MP. But,
instead, they use up a lot of Spirit Points.\e"
M00120014,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)They are quite powerful, but since they take up
a lot of Spirit Points, you need to learn how to
use them as effectively as possible.\e"
M00120015,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Oh, one more thing… if you ever come
across a fruit called a “Moonberry,”
consider yourself lucky.\e"
M00120016,"\h(《Air Pirate》)If you eat a Moonberry, you can learn a new
“Spirit Move.” Some techniques require more
Moonberries than others, so use them wisely!\c"
M00120017,"\h(《Vyse》)No, it's okay. I think I know enough to
be alright.\e"
M00120018,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Heh, alright then. But, just remember, it never
hurts to ask a question. If you can't figure
something out, just come back here, okay?\c"
M00160000,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)This is Lookout Island. We take turns
standing guard here to see if any
suspicious ships might be approaching.\e"
M00160001,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)It gets cold early in the morning, and that can
be tough, but it's all part of the job, I guess.
You just have to sort of accept it.\c"
M00230000,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, here… take this. It's your share of
the loot from yesterday's raid.\e"
M00230001,\h(　)You received a “Purple Moon Stone.”\e
M00230002,"\h(《Dyne》)That Moon Stone has been processed already, so
you should be able to use it on your weapons.\e"
M00230003,"\h(《Dyne》)Now you'll be able to change the color of
your weapon to Purple, and give it the power
of ice in battle.\e"
M00230004,"\h(《Vyse》)I see. Thanks, dad. I'll use it carefully.\e"
M00230005,"\h(《Dyne》)One more thing. When you win a fight, you will
be awarded “magic experience” in the color of
magic that you have equipped on your weapon.\e"
M00230006,"\h(《Dyne》)When you accumulate a certain amount of magic
experience, you will learn a new spell. So,
if there is a spell that you want to learn…\e"
M00230007,"\h(《Dyne》)… by changing the color of your weapon to
match whatever type of magic you want to
learn, you can learn it much faster.\e"
M00230008,"\h(《Dyne》)You can easily change the color of your weapon
by using the “Equip” command or by pressing the
Y button during battles. Make good use of it.\c"
M00230009,"\h(《Dyne》)Hold on a second, Vyse.\e"
M00230010,"\h(《Dyne》)What's the matter, Vyse? Did you want me to
explain what Moon Stones do and how they
affect your weapons again?\e"
M00230011,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Yeah, that'd be great.”
“No, it's alright. I think I got it.”\e"
M00230012,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, that'd be great. I just want to make
sure that I got my facts straight.\e"
M00230013,"\h(《Dyne》)This isn't like you. You usually can't stand
listening to me talk. Well, I hope it's a sign
that you're growing up a little.\e"
M00230014,"\h(《Dyne》)Refined Moon Stones can be used to change
the properties of your weapon.\e"
M00230015,"\h(《Dyne》)Each color has unique properties: Yellow is
lightning, Red is fire, and so forth.\e"
M00230016,"\h(《Dyne》)In addition, when you win a fight, you will
receive magic experience that corresponds
to the current color of your weapon.\e"
M00230017,"\h(《Dyne》)Each time this value reaches a certain level,
you will learn a new spell. So, if there's
a spell you want to learn…\e"
M00230018,"\h(《Dyne》)By changing the color of your weapon, you can
learn the magic of that color that much faster.\e"
M00230019,"\h(《Dyne》)You can easily change the color of your weapon
by using the “Equip” command or by pressing the
Y button during battle. Make good use of it.\c"
M00230020,"\h(《Vyse》)No thanks, I think I've got it. If there's
anything that I don't know, I'll probably find
out during battle… Hehe…\e"
M00230021,"\h(《Dyne》)Just becareful then…
And use those Moon Stones carefully! A good
Moon Stone isn't easy to find…\c"
M00210000,"\h(《Fina》)Thank you so much for everything you've done.
First, you rescued me… and then you let me
stay in your home… I'm eternally grateful.\e"
M00210001,"\h(《Fina》)I suppose you'll be leaving now to retreive that
Moon Stone that fell yesterday… Please do be
careful. Good luck!\c"
M00210002,"\h(《Fina》)I suppose you'll be leaving now to retreive that
Moon Stone that fell yesterday… Please do be
careful. Good luck!\c"
