MI0140000,"\h(《Brabham》)Welcome home. 
Well, how do you like what we've done with the
place?\e"
MI0140001,"\h(《Vyse》)I have to say that I'm really impressed with
your work!\e"
MI0140002,"\h(《Izmael》)Ba ba bam!
What did you expect from the greatest 
carpenter that ever lived?\e"
MI0140003,"\h(《Izmael》)If you keep the gold coming in,
I'll keep adding on!\e"
MI0140004,"\h(《Brabham》)I've been busy, too! I made new 
armor plating for the Delphinus' hull. 
It's super-sturdy!\e"
MI0140005,"\h(《Brabham》)After I add it on to your ship, you'll be able
to fly through those pesky stone reefs without
a hitch!\e"
MI0140006,"\h(《Vyse》)Thank you both for everything you've done 
for us. I would like you both to join my crew 
on board the Delphinus.\e"
MI0140007,"\h(《Vyse》)That reminds me… I got this while we were in 
Yafutoma. Can you do anything with it?\e"
MI0140008,"\h(　)You gave the ”Book on Ship Polarity” to Brabham.
I don't think he's ever been this excited.\e"
MI0140009,"\h(《Brabham》)Well, shiver me timbers! I've never seen this
type of technology before in my life!\e"
MI0140010,"\h(《Brabham》)With this type of engine, you'll be able to fly
higher than the clouds, and lower than you've
ever imagined.\e"
MI0140011,\h(《Brabham》)I'll get started on this baby in a jiffy!\e
MI0140012,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, we should figure out what we're going to
do next.\e"
MI0140013,"\h(《Izmael》)I knew someone would say that! That's why I
built a meeting room into the wall of the cliff.
You can do all of your planning from there.\e"
MI0140014,"\h(《Vyse》)You built us a meeting room? Wow… you're great,
Izmael. Let's go check it out!\e"
MI0140015,\h(　)Brabham has joined your crew as an ”Engineer.”\e
MI0140016,\h(　)Izmael has joined your crew as a ”Carpenter.”\e
MI0150000,"\h(《Izmael》)Ba ba bam!
They're back!!! And the hull seems to be in one
piece.\e"
MI0150001,"\h(《Brabham》)Of course it's in once piece! A little ice isn't
gonna hurt it one bit! \e"
MI0150002,"\h(《Brabham》)Captain Vyse…
About that book from Yafutoma…\e"
MI0150003,"\h(《Brabham》)I built an engine for ya', 
using the plans in that book.\e"
MI0150004,"\h(《Brabham》)Until now, you haven't been able to fly above or
below the clouds because the pressure
differences were too hard on your engine…\e"
MI0150005,"\h(《Brabham》)…But now, that's not a problem! \e"
MI0150006,"\h(《Izmael》)You'll be able to fly over mountains and beneath
large islands! You'll be flyin' all over the
damn place.\e"
MI0150007,"\h(《Vyse》)Really? That's great!
When can you install it?\e"
MI0150008,"\h(《Brabham》)I'll install it tomorrow mornin' at the
crack-a-dawn.\e"
MI0150009,"\h(《Aika》)With the new engine, we'll be able to travel to
more places than ever before!\e"
MI0150010,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright, everyone to the meeting room!
Let's decide where to go next!\e"
MJ0030000,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, Vyse!
Thanks for the food yesterday! It was delicious!\e"
MJ0030001,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, Gilder…
You're leaving already?\e"
MJ0030002,"\h(《Gilder》)Yeah, I need to get going… But before I go, I 
have some news for you… I found out some 
information on the Armada's latest project…\e"
MJ0030003,"\h(《Gilder》)I just heard about this the other day…
It appears that Valua has begun advancing into 
the lower altitudes…\e"
MJ0030004,"\h(《Gilder》)I heard that north of Pirate Isle… 
somewhere beneath the clouds, they're 
building a base on Dangral Island.\e"
MJ0030005,"\h(《Gilder》)It's just a rumor, but I heard that they're 
building a ship that can go into Deep Sky…\e"
MJ0030006,\h(《Vyse》)Deep Sky?\e
MJ0030007,"\h(《Gilder》)Yes… beneath the thick layer of clouds… 
immersed in total darkness… 
there is a ”bottom” of the world.\e"
MJ0030008,"\h(《Gilder》)No one has ever seen what's below the clouds… 
some people say that it's completely dead… \e"
MJ0030009,\h(《Vyse》)What could they be looking for down there?\e
MJ0030010,"\h(《Gilder》)I don't know.
But, Fina's ship sank beneath the clouds, right?\e"
MJ0030011,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… you're right. That must be what they're
after.\e"
MJ0030012,"\h(《Vyse》)Thanks, Gilder.
We'll go check it out.\e"
MJ0030013,"\h(《Gilder》)You don't need to thank me!
Good luck, Vyse!\e"
MJ0100000,"\h(《Brabham》)Oh, Captain Vyse!
We've finished modifying the Delphinus,
right on schedule!\e"
MJ0100001,\h(《Brabham》)Lower the pressure shutters!\e
MJ0100002,\h(《Brabham》)Start the submergence engine!\e
MJ0100003,"\h(《Brabham》)Well? What do you think?
We have successfully converted the Delphinus
into a cloud-delving machine!\e"
MJ0100004,"\h(《Aika》)Good job, Brabham!
Now we'll be able to enter Deep Sky!
You really are the best!!!\e"
MJ0100005,"\h(《Brabham》)Why thank you lil' lady… Before you go… 
I heard there's some sort of vortex 
near Shrine Island.\e"
MJ0100006,\h(《Brabham》)You might be able to submerge through there.\e
MJ0100007,"\h(《Vyse》)The vortex near Shrine Island? Got it.
Alright, everyone… let's get going!\e"
MJ0100008,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse…
Wait a second.\e"
MJ0100009,"\h(《Enrique》)Actually…
There's something important that I wanted to
talk to you about.\e"
MJ0100010,"\h(《Enrique》)I… I must return to Valua. I cannot travel with
you any longer. This will be my last voyage 
with you aboard the Delphinus.\e"
MJ0100011,\h(《Vyse》)What?!\e
MJ0100012,"\h(《Enrique》)Galcian and the Armada have freed themselves 
from the control of the Valuan Empire and 
are acting on their own free will.\e"
MJ0100013,"\h(《Enrique》)Galcian probably has some sort of terrible
scheme planned.\e"
MJ0100014,"\h(《Enrique》)I must return to Valua and report this news to
my mother. He must be stopped.\e"
MJ0100015,"\h(《Aika》)You… you can't! It's too dangerous, Enrique!\e"
MJ0100016,"\h(《Enrique》)…I know the dangers that I face.
And I'm sure that my mother won't readily
listen to anything I have to say.\e"
MJ0100017,"\h(《Enrique》)But, I am still the Prince of Valua.
It is my duty to go.\e"
MJ0100018,\h(《Moegi》)But… Enrique…\e
MJ0100019,"\h(《Enrique》)Princess… do not worry about me.
I don't plan on dying just yet.\e"
MJ0100020,"\h(《Enrique》)I will…
I will return. This, I swear.\e"
MJ0100021,\h(《Moegi》)No………\e
MJ0100022,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, after we get Fina's ship, could you bring 
me to Sailors' Island?\e "
MJ0100024,\h(《Enrique》)I'll be able to borrow a ship there… \e
MJ0100023,\h(《Vyse》)I hope you know what you're doing…\e
MK0010000,"\h(《Vyse》)Home, sweet home.\e"
MK0010001,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey!
Looks like they made it back alive after all!\e"
MK0010002,"\h(《Clara》)Aika! Fina! Long time no see!
Hi, Vyse! You all look well.\e"
MK0010003,"\h(《Vyse》)Gilder…! And Clara?
It's great to see you two. What's in the basket?\e"
MK0010004,"\h(《Clara》)I just baked a bunch of pies! 
Come on! Let's eat while they're still warm!\e"
MK0010005,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! Really?!
Home-made pies? Clara, you're the best!\e"
MK0010006,\h(《Gilder》)I'm glad you all made it back safely.\e
MK0010007,"\h(《Gilder》)And it looks like you got Fina's ship back.
Does that mean you'll be returning to the Great
Silver Shrine soon?\e"
MK0010008,"\h(《Fina》)…Yes.
Thank you, Gilder, for all that you've done for
me.\e"
MK0010009,"\h(《Gilder》)Hahaha 
You don't have to thank me, 
you guys did all the hard stuff.\e"
MK0010010,"\h(《Gilder》)Well, Fina it looks like you've completed your
mission. You're going home a hero. 
Congratulations.\e"
MK0010011,\h(《Fina》)Thank you!\e
MK0010012,"\h(《Gilder》)Well since you're leaving us, we should throw 
you a going away party! Let's hear it for Fina!\e"
MK0010013,\h(《Everyone》)Yeah!\e
M00040000,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow!\e
M01110000,"\h(《Lawrence》)You hired me to do a job. I'm doing the job. 
I'm not obligated to talk to you when 
I'm off of your ship.\c"
M01110001,"\h(《Lawrence》)I've gone against Valua in the past, 
but never to this degree.\e"
M01110002,"\h(《Lawrence》)I never question my employer's motives. 
But don't worry, if I think you're making 
a mistake, I'll let you know.\c"
M01110003,\h(《Lawrence》)My contract is just about up.\e
M01110004,"\h(《Lawrence》)I'm a professional. 
I do what I have to do.\c"
M06330000,"\h(《Khazim's men》)Hey, there!\e"
M06330001,"\h(《Khazim》)Hey, Captain Vyse! 
Do you want to buy some cannons?\e"
M06330002,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)”Buy or sell ship equipment.”
”Talk to Khazim.”
”Leave.”\e"
M06330003,"\h(《Khazim》)Two little girls just came in here, 
and offered to help us.\e"
M06330004,"\h(《Khazim》)Their leader said that she went to 
greet the captain, did you see them?\e"
M06330005,\h(《Khazim》)Come back again!\e
M06330006,\h(《Khazim's men》)Thank you very much!\e
M06330007,"\h(《Khazim》)Hey! Make sure you shine those cannons good!
Those cannons are the heart and soul of the
Delphinus!\e"
M06330008,"\h(《Khazim》)My cannons are always ready to go! 
You never know when you're going 
to have to blow something up!\c"
M06330009,"\h(《Khazim》)If I lose a battle, it's not going 
to be because of a misfire!\c"
M06330010,"\h(《Khazim》)Hey Vyse, I heard that our next 
target is Valua!\e"
M06330011,"\h(《Khazim》)Why don't you stop all this sneaking around 
stuff? \e"
M06330012,"\h(《Khazim》)Just blast your way through the bottom 
of Valua and watch them all fall 
into Deep Sky… Heh heh.\c"
M06330013,"\h(《Khazim》)Hey! Make sure you shine those cannons good!
Those cannons are the heart and soul of the
Delphinus!\e"
M06330014,"\h(《Khazim》)Everyone says I shout too much, but I'm much 
easier to work with than Brabham!\e"
M06330015,"\h(《Khazim》)You weren't here when we were modifying 
the Delphinus' engines… Hearing him yell, 
”Ya got no skills, Sonny!” all day long…\e"
M06330016,"\h(《Khazim》)Hey! Nobody wins battles with Defense! 
These cannons need to be ready to go!\e"
M06330017,"\h(《Khazim》)That Ramirez guy, he destroyed my hometown twice
already!\e"
M06330018,\h(《Khazim》)He's gonna pay!!\e
M06330019,"\h(《Khazim》)We need these cannons ready to go! 
We've got a war to win!\e"
M06330020,"\h(《Khazim》)Vyse, I've got a personal score to settle with
Ramirez. I can't wait until we fight him!\e"
M06330021,"\h(《Khazim》)The cannons are ready, and so am I!\c"
M06340000,"\h(《Khazim's men》)If you need something, just ask Khazim!\c"
M06340001,"\h(《Khazim's men》)Look at this shine! We're gonna blow holes 
in the Valuan fleet and look good doing it!\e"
M06340002,"\h(《Khazim's men》)I can't wait to start firing on 
Valuan ships!\c"
M06340003,"\h(《Khazim's men》)So we're going to try to sneak into 
Valua by going underneath it. 
That's a pretty good idea!\e"
M06340004,"\h(《Khazim's men》)I hope we have a clean shot at some 
of their ships while we're there.\c"
M06340005,"\h(《Khazim's men》)I know we're heading into Deep Sky. 
There's more air pressure down there. 
I'll make a few adjustments to the cannons!\c"
M06340006,"\h(《Khazim's men》)We're sorry, Captain.\e"
M06340007,"\h(《Khazim's men》)The Armada took us completely by surprise.
That won't happen again!\c"
M06340008,"\h(《Khazim's men》)I love the smell of a well-oiled cannon! 
You'll be able to fire these babies 
all you want!\c"
M06350000,"\h(《Khazim's men》)A pretty girl was here just a minute ago. 
Didn't you see her?\c"
M06350001,"\h(《Khazim's men》)Vyse, which girl on Clara's ship 
do you like the best?\e"
M06350002,"\h(《Khazim's men》)I have a thing for girls who wear glasses… Heh.
\c"
M06350003,"\h(《Khazim's men》)We're going to dive under Valua, huh?\e"
M06350004,"\h(《Khazim's men》)I'm game, as long as I get to shoot at stuff.\c"
M06350005,"\h(《Khazim's men》)Hey, umm… Vyse, at our last crew meeting, 
the girl with the glasses made lunch for 
everyone. That was really nice of her.\e"
M06350006,"\h(《Khazim's men》)I was just wondering if we could have 
another meeting.\e"
M06350007,"\h(《Khazim's men》)So, Ramirez was the one who led the 
attack on Nasrad…\e"
M06350008,"\h(《Khazim's men》)I can't wait till we fight him again! 
I'm gonna shoot him full of holes!\c"
M06350009,"\h(《Khazim's men》)Vyse, when you go up against Ramirez again, 
let us know. It's personal!\c"
M14000000,"\h(《Brabham》)That ”Book of Ship Polarity” is amazin'! 
I'm learnin' so much!\e"
M14000001,"\h(《Brabham》)I want to go with you on the Delphinus.
That way, I can take better care of her on
a regular basis.\e"
M14000002,"\h(《Vyse》)So you'll be our onboard engineer? That's great!
Thanks, Brabham!\e"
M14000003,"\h(《Brabham》)Well, I'm just happy to be working on such 
a fine ship! It's great and it's gettin' 
better every day!\e"
M14000004,"\h(《Brabham》)I'll have the Delphinus running 
smoother than ever!\e"
M14000005,"\h(　)Brabham has joined your crew as an ”Engineer.”
And he's mighty good at what he does!\c"
M14000006,"\h(《Brabham》)If I can successfully build a new engine with
the book you brought back from Yafutoma, the
Delphinus will be able to fly to new heights!\e"
M14000007,"\h(《Brabham》)While you're out on your next voyage, 
I'll be studyin' and buildin', yes sirree!\c"
M14000008,"\h(《Brabham》)I've reinforced the armor on the bow of the 
ship! You'll be able to fly through glaciers 
like they're nothin'! \e"
M14000009,"\h(《Brabham》)You'll be able to fly through the 
stone reefs in Ixa'taka, too! 
Damn, I'm good!\c"
M14000010,"\h(《Brabham》)With that new engine we built using
the ”Book on Ship Polarity,” you can fly the 
Delphinus above and below the clouds!\e"
M14000011,"\h(《Brabham》)We can fly all over the damn place! 
I can't wait!\c"
M14000012,"\h(《Brabham》)Captain, there were some youngin's 
looking for you in your meeting room. 
Did you see them?\c"
M14000013,"\h(《Brabham》)Captain Vyse, I finished right on time!\e"
M14000014,"\h(《Brabham》)Now that the Delphinus can submerge, 
it is the greatest ship in the sky!\c"
M14000015,\h(《Brabham》)The port and Delfinus★★ were safe.\e
M14000016,"\h(《Brabham》)The maintenance of the little girl's ship is
already done but…will everything be okay?\e"
M14000017,"\h(《Brabham》)Fina's ship is rearin' to go! 
It's at the cape! \c"
M14000018,"\h(《Brabham》)Welcome back, Captain!
The Delphinus and your base 
are lookin' good!\c"
M14000019,"\h(《Brahbam》)Some crusty old island just rose out 
of Deep Sky! What's going on?!\c"
M14000020,"\h(《Brabham》)The Delphinus is ready when you are!
You can take her out any time you want!\c"
M14010000,"\h(《Izmael》)Hi there, Captain!
I've been busy working on your base! 
I hope you like it!\e"
M14010001,"\h(《Vyse》)Thanks, Izmael!
It looks great! I appreciate 
all the hard work!\e"
M14010002,"\h(《Izmael》)I'm glad you know quality when you see it!
Now that most of the work on the island is
done…\e"
M14010003,\h(《Izmael》)I want to sail with you on your ship!\e
M14010004,"\h(《Vyse》)We'd love to have you! 
You're an inspiration to us all!\e"
M14010005,"\h(《Izmael》)Captain Vyse, it's an honor to sail with me!\e"
M14010006,\h(　)Izmael has joined your crew as a ”Carpenter.”\e
M14010007,"\h(《Izmael》)Make sure you use the meeting room that I built
for you! There isn't a finer meeting room under 
the Six Moons!\c"
M14020000,"\h(《Energetic girl》)Nice to meet you!
You're Captain Vyse, right?\e"
M14020001,"\h(《Energetic girl》)Captain Clara has ordered me to come aboard
the Delphinus and train with your crew so I can
be a better gunner!\e"
M14020002,"\h(《Energetic girl》)Oh, and my friends Lilly and Nara are 
coming with me. I hope you don't mind!\e"
M14020003,"\h(《Energetic girl》)We're a team! We'll take care of your cannons!
We're gonna knock those Valuans out 
of the sky!\e"
M14020004,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure…
And your name is…?\e"
M14020005,"\h(《Energetic girl》)Oh, I'm sorry! I forgot! I mean I didn't forget
my name! I just forgot to tell you! I wouldn't 
forget my name! That would be silly!\e"
M14020006,"\h(《Energetic girl》)I'm Belle.
I don't have much experience with cannons, 
but I'll try my best!\e"
M14020007,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, you seem enthusiastic enough.
I'll give you a chance, and we'll 
see how you do.\e"
M14020008,"\h(《Belle》)Yes, sir!
I will do my best, sir!\e"
M14020009,\h(　)Belle has joined your crew as a ”Gunner.”\e
M14020051,"\h(《Belle》)I'll run a store here on Crescent Isle! 
If you need anything for your ship, 
just let me know!\c"
M14020033,"\h(《Belle》)I'm so sorry! I can't believe the Armada found 
us. I feel responsible, since I'm a gunner 
and all… \e"
M14020034,"\h(《What will you say to Belle?》)”Don't worry about it!”
”You should have been paying more attention.”\e"
M14020035,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't worry about it, Belle!
They caught all of us by surprise. 
There was nothing you could have done.\e"
M14020036,"\h(《Vyse》)You shouldn't be too hard on yourself. 
The important thing is that everyone 
is okay.\e"
M14020037,"\h(《Belle》)Yeah, I guess you're right. Well, I should 
start helping everyone with the base! 
We'll build it better than before!\e"
M14020038,"\h(《Vyse》)If you were paying more attention, you might 
have seen them coming. As your punishment, 
you have to start cleaning up the debris.\e"
M14020039,"\h(《Vyse》)I should have been paying more attention too.
I'll be picking up debris right there with you.
Sound fair?\e"
M14020040,"\h(《Belle》)Yes, yessir!
I'll do my best!\c"
M14020041,\h(《Belle》)I'm going to work really hard!\c
M14020010,\h(《Belle》)Welcome Captain.\e
M14020011,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)”Buy or Sell Ship Equipment”
”Gossip”
”Leave”\e"
M14020012,"\h(《Belle》)Ohhh! I'm such an airhead.
I gave Brabham the wrong part earlier!
I hope he realizes it before it's too late…\e"
M14020013,"\h(《Belle》)I'm not used to running a shop, so I keep making
all sorts of mistakes. Well… I always make
mistakes, anyway… but not the shop kind.\e"
M14020014,"\h(《Belle》)But it's my goal to be able to do something
without messing it up! That's what I'm here for!
I'm bound to get something right!\c"
M14020015,"\h(《Belle》)I'm going to do my best! I want to be an Air 
Pirate like Captain Clara someday!\c"
M14020016,"\h(《Belle》)When we go to Valua, I'll shoot down their 
entire fleet! Bring 'em on! I hope I don't miss 
too much!\e"
M14020017,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, actually, we're going to sneak into 
Valuan airspace by flying under the islands.\e"
M14020018,"\h(《Belle》)Oh, hehe… Well, I guess that makes more sense 
than attacking the entire Valuan Armada 
head on! Good idea, Captain!\e"
M14020019,"\h(《Belle》)I thought we were going to attack them, 
so I loaded more than enough cannonballs!
I even threw in some extra in case I miss.\c"
M14020020,"\h(《Belle》)Well since we already have enough ammo, maybe we
should attack them head on! It would be a shame
just to let all of the cannonballs sit there.\c"
M14020044,"\h(《Belle》)We're going to Valua, right? Great! I'll get
my cannons ready and I'll blast those Valuans
out of…\e"
M14020045,"\h(《Vyse》)Wait a second… we're not going to launch
an attack on Valua just yet. We're just trying
to make our way inland.\e"
M14020046,"\h(《Belle》)Huh? Oh, my! I'm sorry! I thought… that we… oh
no… I can't believe how clueless I am.\e"
M14020047,"\h(《Belle》)And I polished all of the cannonballs nicely,
too. I was so looking forward to showing
everyone that I could do a good job. Oh, well…\c"
M14020048,"\h(《Belle》)Well, although I may have messed up, at
least we have a bunch of polished cannonballs!
Please, feel free to use them!\c"
M14020049,"\h(《Belle》)Really? Using those plans that you found, you
can make an engine that can take us underneath
the Great Cloud Sea?!\e"
M14020050,"\h(《Belle》)That's amazing!
I may be a little clumsy, but I'll do my best
to help build the engine, okay?\c"
M14020021,"\h(《Belle》)We're finally going under the Great Cloud Sea!
I've been practicing holding my breath! 
Wanna see?\e"
M14020022,"\h(《Vyse》)Practicing holding your breath? No, no, no… 
As long as we're inside the Delphinus,
we'll be able to breathe normally.\e"
M14020023,"\h(《Belle》)Oh, is that true?
I guess that makes sense.\e"
M14020024,"\h(《Belle》)I thought that we weren't going to have any air,
so I've been dunking my head in the pond and 
practicing. How silly of me.\c"
M14020025,"\h(《Belle》)That's good that we'll be able to breathe down 
there, because I was the only one practicing 
holding my breath!\c"
M14020042,"\h(《Belle》)You're going to the Great Silver Shrine, right!\e"
M14020043,"\h(《Belle》)We'll have this place looking as good as new, 
by the time you get back! \c"
M14020026,"\h(《Belle》)Well, what do you think of the island? I'm 
still tired from chasing the chickens all over 
the place.\e"
M14020027,"\h(《Belle》)And with all of the extra debris, we had a huge 
bonfire at the pond. We had the best time!\e"
M14020028,"\h(《Belle》)Oops! I wasn't supposed to say anything 
about that… Don't tell anyone I told you, okay?
\c"
M14020029,"\h(《Belle》)Hehe, please don't tell anyone that you know 
about the bonfire… \c"
M14020052,"\h(《Belle》)I can't believe it's almost time for our battle 
with Galcian… I'm so nervous…\e"
M14020053,"\h(《Belle》)But, since Captain Clara and the other Air
Pirates will be fighting alongside of us,
I'm confident we will win!!\c"
M14020030,"\h(《Belle》)So, we're going to fight Ramirez! 
I'll do my best!\e"
M14020031,"\h(《Belle》)I know I still have a lot to learn, but
I'm going to do my best against Ramirez!\c"
M14020032,"\h(《Belle》)Thank you very much!
Please come again!\e"
M14090000,"\h(《Lilly》)I'm going to find true love in the skies, 
just like Captain Clara!\e"
M14090001,"\h(《Lilly》)I'm going to sail the world and 
find the cutest guy!\c"
M14090002,"\h(《Lilly》)Do you think that there are cute guys 
at the Great Silver Shrine? If there are, 
would you tell them about me?\c"
M14090003,"\h(《Lilly》)You're going into Deep Sky? 
I've heard lots of bad stories about that place.
Be careful!\e"
M14090004,"\h(《Lilly》)If there are any guys down there, they're 
probably all pasty white and cursed. 
I don't think I'd want a guy from there.\c"
M14090011,"\h(《Lilly》)We were sitting there at the port, 
and then there were some explosions!\e"
M14090012,"\h(《Lilly》)Rocks and stuff started falling, then we 
smelled the smoke! Belle was so scared, 
she started crying!\c"
M14090013,"\h(《Lilly》)You're going to Fina's homeland? Wow! Have fun…
Umm… If they have fun there. Fina's pretty
reserved, you know?\c"
M14090005,"\h(《Lilly》)Oh, Captain Vyse. I was really scared during 
the battle the other day!\e"
M14090006,"\h(《Lilly》)But that Admiral, he was good-looking. 
I love a man in uniform.\e"
M14090007,"\h(《Lilly》)But guys that kill people don't really do it
for me. Oh, no offense… I mean, you're one of
the good guys. I don't like bad people.\c"
M14090014,"\h(《Lilly》)I see that even you, Captain Vyse, are a little
nervous about facing off with Galcian.\e"
M14090015,"\h(《Lilly》)Well, with three beautiful cannon-goddesses
onboard your ship, you have nothing to worry
about!\c"
M14090008,"\h(《Lilly》)So, you're going to fight that good-looking 
Admiral for Fina, right?\e"
M14090009,"\h(《Lilly》)Haha, that was just a joke. I was just kidding.\e"
M14090010,"\h(《Lilly》)Seriously Vyse, lead us to victory! 
Then we can all come back here and party!!!\c"
M14100000,"\h(《Nara》)I heard that when Captain Clara was our age, 
she met Gilder! She met him at a port in his
hometown.\e"
M14100001,"\h(《Nara》)She fell madly in love with him. But as fate 
would have it, Gilder quickly left the city 
the next day to become an Air Pirate.\e"
M14100002,\h(《Nara》)I guess it was just bad timing. \c
M14100003,"\h(《Nara》)Later on, Captain Clara found Gilder's ship! 
She was so happy!\e"
M14100004,"\h(《Nara》)She started firing at his ship to get 
his attention. Gilder fired back. 
How romantic.\e"
M14100005,"\h(《Nara》)I really look up to Captain Clara. 
She's so passionate.\c"
M14100006,"\h(《Nara》)Captain Gilder must be playing hard to get, 
because he's been running away from her ever 
since.\e"
M14100007,"\h(《Nara》)He should know that he doesn't have to play 
hard to get to sweep Clara off of her feet.\e"
M14100008,"\h(《Nara》)Oh, well… love is blind.\c"
M14100012,"\h(《Nara》)Belle and Lilly were really scared. I think 
they're okay now.\c"
M14100013,"\h(《Nara》)You're going to Fina's homeland? 
Be careful, Captain!\e"
M14100009,"\h(《Nara》)Captain Clara is searching the globe, so she 
can make Gilder the world's greatest pie!\e"
M14100010,"\h(《Nara》)She once attacked Gordo's ship to steal the 
ultimate pie crust from him.\e"
M14100011,"\h(《Nara》)I look up to Captain Clara, she is a 
perfectionist.\c"
M14100016,"\h(《Nara》)The time has finally come to battle Galcian,
huh?\e"
M14100017,"\h(《Nara》)Fighting the Armada… fighting Galcian… it's
all so exciting!!!\c"
M14100014,"\h(《Nara》)After we save the world, do you think that guys 
will be too intimidated to approach me?\e"
M14100015,"\h(《Nara》)I hope they won't be. I know that there is 
someone out there… waiting for me.\c"
