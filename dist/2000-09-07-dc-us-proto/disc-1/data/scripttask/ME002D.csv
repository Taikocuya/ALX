MA0100002,\h(《Everyone》)Yeah!!!\e
MA0100003,"\h(《Aika》)Well Fina, this is what we do!  What do you
think?\e"
MA0100004,"\h(《Fina》)Well…
It certainly looks challenging.\e"
MA0100005,"\h(《Aika》)Hahaha… challenging, huh…
Well, now that you mention it, it isn't easy.
But it is fun!\e"
MA0100006,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the underground port inside of Pirate 
Isle. From the outside, this island looks like
a quiet, peaceful village.\e"
MA0100007,"\h(《Vyse》)But the inside of the island is where our 
headquarters is located.\e"
MA0100008,"\h(《Aika》)There are armories, shops, and even a tavern
inside here.
Come on, we'll give you a tour.\e"
MA0100009,\h(《Dyne》)Vyse!\e
MA0100010,"\h(《Dyne》)Come to my office immediately… and bring that 
girl with you.\e"
MA0100011,\h(《Aika》)Vyse… I wonder what that was all about.\e
MA0100012,"\h(《Vyse》)… I'm not sure, but we'd better hurry. 
You know how my dad gets when we're late.\e"
MA0110000,"\h(《Vyse》)Vyse and Aika reporting for duty.
And we've brought Fina like you requested.\e"
MA0110001,"\h(《Dyne》)Hmph… you're a little late.
I'll let it slide this time… Come on over.\e"
MA0110002,"\h(《Dyne》)Young lady, I am Dyne, the Captain of the Blue
Rogues. There are a few questions that I want to
ask you. Will you answer them for me?\e"
MA0110003,\h(《Fina》)Of… of course.\e
MA0110004,"\h(《Dyne》)Well then, on to the first question.
What is your name?\e"
MA0110005,\h(《Fina》)…… It's Fina.\e
MA0110006,"\h(《Dyne》)… Alright.
Next question.\e"
MA0110007,"\h(《Dyne》)I've been sailing for a very long time, but
I've never come across anyone wearing clothes
like yours.\e"
MA0110008,"\h(《Dyne》)What country are you from and why were you
traveling alone out there?\e"
MA0110009,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Defend Fina”
”Sit quietly and listen”\e"
MA0110010,"\h(《Vyse》)Dad, you're worrying too much.
Fina is just a normal girl.\e"
MA0110011,"\h(《Dyne》)… Vyse.
Even though I am your father, I am also the 
leader of the Blue Rogues.\e"
MA0110012,"\h(《Dyne》)Therefore, it is my duty to not only protect
the safety of my family, but the safety of my
crew as well.\e"
MA0110013,"\h(《Dyne》)If this girl is a danger of any sort to you or 
any of my men, I cannot let her live.\e"
MA0110014,\h(《Vyse》)……\e
MA0110015,"\h(《Aika》)Cap'n Dyne, you worry too much.
Fina is just a normal girl.\e"
MA0110016,"\h(《Dyne》)Silence, Aika.\e"
MA0110017,"\h(《Dyne》)I am the captain here.
It is my duty to protect the safety of
my family and my crew.\e"
MA0110018,"\h(《Dyne》)If this girl is a danger of any sort to you or 
any of my men, I cannot let her live.\e"
MA0110019,\h(《Aika》)But… but…\e
MA0110020,"\h(《Dyne》)Fina…
It is your turn to speak.\e"
MA0110021,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MA0110022,\h(《Aika》)Fina…\e
MA0110023,\h(《Fina》)… I… I cannot say.\e
MA0110024,"\h(《Dyne》)Why is that?
Is it because we are Air Pirates?
Don't you trust us?\e"
MA0110025,"\h(《Fina》)No, that has nothing to do with it.
I thank you with all my heart for saving my 
life.\e"
MA0110026,"\h(《Fina》)But I cannot tell any living soul about the 
purpose of my quest. Even if it means 
sacrificing my own life.\e"
MA0110027,"\h(《Fina》)I have no intention of endangering any of your 
lives. If you believe anything that I say, 
please believe this.\e"
MA0110028,\h(《Dyne》)……\e
MA0110029,"\h(《Dyne》)… Alright then.
Heh… looks like I lost this one.\e"
MA0110030,"\h(《Dyne》)I understand your dilemma. And I can see in
your eyes that you are true to your word.\e"
MA0110031,"\h(《Dyne》)Although we're Air Pirates, we also have a 
strong sense of honor.\e"
MA0110032,"\h(《Dyne》)You do not need to divulge the details of your 
quest. Understand that you now have my trust… 
Be careful that you do not lose it.\e"
MA0110033,"\h(《Fina》)Captain Dyne…
Thank you kindly.
I will not disappoint you.\e"
MA0110034,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, Aika…
Bring the girl… Fina topside and give her a
tour of the village.\e"
MA0110035,\h(《Aika》)Now that's more like it!\e
MA0110036,"\h(《Vyse》)Way to go Dad!
You're the best!\e"
MA0110037,"\h(《Dyne》)… It's not ”Dad”. It's Captain!
I swear… how many times do I have to remind
you?\e"
MA0110038,"\h(《Dyne》)You're excused.
Don't be late for dinner.\e"
MA0160000,\h(《Vyse》)Mom!!!\e
MA0160001,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Vyse! Aika!
Thank the Moons you two are safe!\e"
MA0160002,\h(《Aika》)What happened here?\e
MA0160003,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)It was the Imperial Armada…
They came out of nowhere and attacked us.\e"
MA0160004,"\h(《Vyse》)What happened to Dad?
Where is everyone else?!\e"
MA0160005,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Your father said that if we fight, too many 
lives would be lost. So, he… he surrendered.\e"
MA0160006,\h(《Aika》)So Cap'n Dyne… and the others…\e
MA0160007,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)They were taken prisoner by the Armada and taken
to Valua.\e"
MA0160008,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn!
… Fina! What happened to Fina!\e"
MA0160009,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I'm sorry, Vyse…
The Armada took her too.\e"
MA0160010,"\h(《Aika》)In Valua, the punishment for Piracy is death! 
Fina will probably be killed, too!\e"
MA0160011,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, what should we do?!\e"
MA0160012,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Try and save everyone!”
”There's nothing you can do.”\e"
MA0160013,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you think, Aika?
We have to save our families… and Fina!\e"
MA0160014,"\h(《Vyse》)I know rescuing everyone isn't going to be easy,
but it's not impossible!\e"
MA0160015,"\h(《Vyse》)We can't let them get away with this. 
Don't worry, we'll get them back… somehow.\e"
MA0160016,"\h(《Aika》)… Yeah, you're right!
It's up to us. 
We can't give up now!\e"
MA0160017,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, let's go! Let's show those Valuans what
happens when they mess with the Blue Rogues!\e"
MA0160018,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you mean, ”What should we do?”
We can't do anything by ourselves…\e"
MA0160019,"\h(《Aika》)Don't give up, Vyse!
Let's go to Valua and rescue them!\e"
MA0160020,"\h(《Aika》)We're the only ones who can. 
We're the only ones left, Vyse!\e"
MA0160021,"\h(《Aika》)I thought you said you won't give up on anything
without giving it your best shot!!!\e"
MA0160022,\h(《Vyse》)Aika…\e
MA0160023,"\h(《Vyse》)You're right. We should leave right away. Our 
friends, our 
families… Fina… they're all counting on us!\e"
MA0160024,"\h(《Aika》)… Yeah!
Let's go, Vyse.\e"
MA0160025,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Wait…
You won't be able to do anything against Valua 
in the shape you're in right now.\e"
MA0160026,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Don't just rush after them.  You'll need a plan 
first. It's not going to be an easy fight.\e"
MA0160027,"\h(《Aika》)But, but…
If we don't hurry, everyone might…\e"
MA0160028,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)My husband always said, ”Acting quickly and 
 are two completely different things.”\e"
MA0160029,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Especially in times like these, you must calm 
down and plan every move carefully.\e"
MA0160030,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Don't worry… everything will be alright.
He… your father won't let things end like this,
not him.\e"
MA0160031,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah mom, you're right.\e"
MA0160032,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika… Let's rest up today.
We'll leave for Valua first thing in the
morning!\e"
MA0160033,\h(《Aika》)Okay!\e
MA0270000,\h(《Air Pirates》)Cheers!\e
MA0270001,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Haha…
There's nothing quite like the taste of loqua
after a long day of hard work!\e"
MA0270002,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)Heh… it's been a while since we've taken over
an Armada Flagship. We earned these drinks!\e"
MA0270003,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Hmm? Should you be sitting here drinking when
you've got a beautiful, hard-working wife
waiting for you at home?\e"
MA0270004,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Hey! It's an Air Pirate's duty to pay proper
respects to the local tavern after
every mission!\e"
MA0270005,"\h(《Aika》)My, oh my… This place sure is full…\e"
MA0270006,"\h(《Aika》)Fina, this is our tavern…
They serve all kinds of drinks here:  nectars,
juices, loqua…\e"
MA0270007,"\h(《Fina》)Um…
Excuse me, but what exactly is ”loqua”?\e"
MA0270008,"\h(《Vyse》)WHAT?!
Fina… you really don't know what loqua is?\e"
MA0270009,"\h(《Fina》)Well… um…
I don’t know exactly, but it appears to be a 
really good tasting drink of some kind.\e"
MA0270010,"\h(《Fina》)Everyone seems to be drinking it so fervently…
it must be delicious.\e"
MA0270011,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)What was that young lady?
You're curious about loqua? Come! Join us!
We've got a bottle of Mur Loqua here!\e"
MA0270012,"\h(《Aika》)Nononononono!
We can't let her drink that now.
We have to go talk to the Cap'n!\e"
MA0270013,"\h(《Fina》)Why?
Does something bad happen when you drink it?\e"
MA0270014,"\h(《Aika》)Well… nothing really happens… See, umm… loqua
is a drink that relaxes you…
and cheers you up at the same time.\e"
MA0270015,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… I don't think we want any of it now. 
It's hard enough to take my dad seriously.\e"
MA0270016,"\h(《Aika》)That's true…
Come on! We should get going.\e"

It's just… It's just that it came a lot
sooner than I expected… or hoped.\e"
M00080006,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)So stand tall, son. Go chase after those dreams
that you've always talked about. And make sure
you take care of Aika, too, okay?\c"
M00080007,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Stand tall, son. Go chase after those dreams
that you've always talked about. And make sure
you take care of Aika, too, okay?\c"
M00090000,"\h(《Jessica》)Vyse, your mother was really worried about you.\e"
M00090001,"\h(《Jessica》)The last time I saw her, she was in Captain
Dyne's office. Go see her, Vyse…
Let her know that you're okay.\c"
M00110000,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Hah hah hah! It's been a long time since I've
seen the Valuans get their butts beaten that
badly! Good job, Vyse!\e"
M00110001,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)And while I'm in a such a good mood, I think
I'll go up to the training center above ground
and have myself a good workout.\c"
M00120000,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)The Captain is the one who summoned you.
Go speak to him first.\c"
M00130000,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh, come right in.
This is a weapon and armor shop.\e"
M00130001,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Sorry, but I'm going to have to charge you even
if you are a fellow Air Pirate. I have to go to
a lot of trouble to get my stock.\e"
M00130002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk to Zack.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00130003,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Most weapons are forged out of Moon Stones.
Well, it's not the only thing used, but it's one
of the main materials.\e"
M00130004,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)And since weapons are made of Moon Stones,
they can be affected by other Moon Stones
if used properly.\e"
M00130005,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)To learn all the details, ask at the training
center that's located above ground.\e"
M00130006,\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh. Thanks for stopping by.\c
M00130007,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Captain Dyne ordered me to keep all of
the weapons locked up.\e"
M00130008,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)That's probably so the other Pirates don't raid
my stock. Otherwise, how would I make money?
Hehehe…\c"
M00130009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Hear what Zack has to say.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00130010,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)If you intend to tangle with Valua, I
suggest you buy some powerful weapons.\e"
M00130011,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)We wouldn't want Captain Dyne's only son to
perish for want of a good blade… Heh heh heh.\e"
M00130012,\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh. Thanks for stopping by.\c
M00135000,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hey there Vyse. Or should I say “Vyse the
Ninny?” Hehehe… I've heard stories of your
misadventures…\e"
M00135001,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse. You looking to buy something?\e"
M00135002,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well… if it isn't little Vyse the Determined.
Are you here to buy something?\e"
M00135003,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well… if it isn't little Vyse the Respected.
I've been hearing about your adventures lately.
Just make sure not to disappoint your father…\e"
M00135004,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Admirable. I laughed when I first heard
that one. But, I suppose if you've earned the
name, you deserve it…\e"
M00135005,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well, well… if it isn't Vyse the Bold. I heard
you're becoming quite the Air Pirate. Almost
better than your dad, from what I hear…\e"
M00135006,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Valiant… has a nice ring to it, eh?
I suppose you've earned the name… Just try
to live up to it, okay?\e"
M00135007,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)So, they call you “Vyse the Daring” now, eh?
Bah… I've known you since you were a baby. I'm
not sure if picking on Aika counts as “daring.”\e"
M00135008,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hahaha… If it isn't Vyse the Dashing! I wonder
who gave you that name… A lady, perhaps? I
wonder what Aika thinks about that…\e"
M00135009,"\h(《Zack the  Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Fearless… You know what? Ever since
people started calling you that, your dad hasn't
stopped bragging…\e"
M00135010,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)You've become quite the sailor, haven't you?
Not even your father was ever called a hero!
That's quite a name you've earned for yourself…\e"
M00135011,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse, King of Rogues… I wonder if your dad will
agree with that one… How about “Vyse, Prince of
Rogues…” I'm sure he'll like that one better.\e"
M00135012,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)I can't believe an annoying little kid like you
would grow up someday to become a living legend.
Heh… Well, I'm honored to know you, Vyse.\e"
M00140000,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh, hello, Vyse! Do come in!
See anything that you want to buy?\e"
M00140001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to Erinn.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00140002,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Unlike spells that require MP, if you have a
healing crystal, you can recover your HP
anytime and anyplace.\e"
M00140003,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Some of the “tougher” Air Pirates refuse to use
them to save themselves, but I say it never
hurts to play it safe.\e"
M00140004,\h(《Erinn Item Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by. Come again!\c
M00140005,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Welcome home. I've set aside some special
items just for you and your crew.\e"
M00140006,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Use these items and make those Valuans
regret everything they've done to us!\e"
M00140007,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Hear what Erinn has to say.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00140008,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Don't worry about the injured, Vyse. I've got
plenty of Sacri Crystals in stock to take
care of everyone.\e"
M00140009,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)If all the Air Pirates never come home, I'll be
out of business. That's why I'm counting on you
to bring them all back, Vyse!\c"
M00145000,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh… Hey, Vyse. You know what? I heard people
have been calling you “Vyse the Ninny” lately.
I wouldn't let it bother you too much, okay?\e"
M00145001,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh, hey there Vyse. You here to buy something?\e"
M00145002,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Determined.
Sounds like you're starting to make a name
for yourself, there. Your dad must be proud.\e"
M00145003,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey, Vyse! From what I hear, you're starting to
gain a lot of respect out there as a sailor!
Good for you…\e"
M00145004,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Vyse the Admirable… It's a suitable name, I
guess. I bet you're popular among the ladies…
Hahaha…\e"
M00145005,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse. You know what I just noticed?
You're starting to look a lot like your father.
Maybe it's the way you carry yourself, now…\e"
M00145006,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Valiant. That name
makes you sound so… honorable. Hahaha…
I'm sorry… I didn't mean to laugh…\e"
M00145007,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)“Vyse the Daring,” huh? I suppose it's a fitting
name… I don't know anyone who's as craz… er…
I mean… daring as you are.\e"
M00145008,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse the Dashing. You really seem
be making a name for yourself as a sailor these
days. Well, good for you, Vyse.\e"
M00145009,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)So, now they call you “Vyse the Fearless?”
Haha… I can remember when you were afraid of
the dark as a baby! My, how things change…\e"
M00145010,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Hero. That's quite a
nickname you've earned for youself, there. Just
make sure you live up to it, okay?\e"
M00145011,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)“The King of Rogues,” huh? Heh… I wonder who
gave you that nickname. It definitely wasn't
your dad, I'll tell you that…\e"
M00145012,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Wow… I never would have thought that you would
become a legend! Everyone here on Pirate Isle
is so proud of you…\e"
M00150000,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)Hooray! We're home! You know, there really isn't
anything else quiet like the feeling you get
when you reach your home port.\c"
M00150001,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)If you ever lose track of your position during
a voyage, just look at your map! You should be
able to find exactly where you are.\e"
M00150002,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)I'm sure your father showed you how to draw
a good map, so every time you explore somewhere
new, you should draw it on your map.\e"
M00150003,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)It's every sailor's dream to have a complete
map of the entire world drawn by his own hand…\c"
M00150004,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)It's every sailor's dream to have a complete
map of the entire world drawn by his own hand…\c"
M00150005,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)Vyse! Heh… I hear you've been causing plenty of
trouble for the Valuan Empire.\e"
M00150006,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)All I ask is that you show them what we Blue
Rogues are made of. We gotta get them back for
what they did to us!!\c"
M00160000,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)My job is to guide the Albatross into the
underground entrance so that it can dock
in the harbor safely.\e"
M00160001,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)We use flag signals to communicate to each other
over vast distances. Right now, I'm coordinating
the loading of supplies onto the Albatross.\c"
M00160002,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Cannon shells… 20 rounds remaining…
Drinking water… 10 barrels remaining…
Um… What else…\c"
M00160003,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Thanks to the healing crystals that Erinn had,
all of my wounds have healed and I'm feeling
much better!\e"
M00160004,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Oh, and your new ship's called the Little Jack,
right? I'll resupply it for you, so you just
sit back and relax there, Vyse.\c"
M00160005,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)New ships are always so much nicer. I'll make
sure to load your ship with plenty of supplies.
Wouldn't want you to run out of fuel now…\c"
M00160006,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Captain Dyne ordered me to load the ship
with battle supplies.\e"
M00160007,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)I think the Captain is planning to go out and
cause a little mayhem of his own. Heh heh…\c"
M00170000,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne's orders… The exit to the
village above ground has been locked.\e"
M00170001,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)He said that you weren't allowed to bring the
girl topside until he's had a chance to talk
with her. You better go see him first.\c"
M00170002,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne said the girl… I mean Fina is
permitted to wander freely throughout the
island. So, I unlocked the door.\e"
M00170003,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Also, there are two treasure chests in this
underground port containing emergency supplies
somwhere… You might want to look for them.\c"
M00170004,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)There are two treasure chests in this
underground port containing emergency supplies
somwhere… You might want to look for them.\c"
M00170005,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Vyse… what you did back in Valua was amazing!
I've never seen you fight so hard before!
You've become quite the Air Pirate!\e"
M00170006,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne has trained you well. I'm sure
you'll make a fine captain someday just like
your father.\c"
M00170007,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Hey there, Vyse. How's the sailing been?\e"
M00170008,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne is proud of everything that you and
your crew have accomplished. Keep up the good
work, wherever you go.\c"
M00170009,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)What?! You escaped from Valua again? And
this time you also stole the Armada's
most powerful ship?!\e"
M00170010,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Wow! I don't know if you're crazy or just plain
tough, but one thing's for sure… you're always
full of surprises!\c"
M00170011,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Have you seen our new ship yet, Vyse?
Captain Dyne had us build a new one…
It's called the Albatross II.\e"
M00170012,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)We still had the old blue-prints, so we were
able to reconstruct the first Albatross exactly
the way it was.\e"
M00170013,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Well, we actually upgraded its engines and
armor… But, just by looking at it, you could
never tell that it's much more powerful now.\c"
M00170014,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Now that we finally have a ship again, we can
get back to doing what we do best…
Being Air Pirates!!\c"
M00170015,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Vyse… I saw that strange island come rising up
from beneath the clouds… I really don't know
what to make of it.\e"
M00170016,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)I don't know why, but that island… it just
LOOKS like it's begging to be explored. Hehe…
Maybe it's just me…\c"
M00180000,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)15 Pirates escaped with their lives…
And only a single bottle of loqua between them…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180001,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Heh heh! I've got a good singing voice, eh?
This's the song we Pirates sing when we're
forced to swab the decks…\c"
M00180002,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Sad is the fate of the captured Air Pirate…
They make his head part from his shoulders…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180003,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Man, that famous song almost came true for us.
We were so close to actually kissing the
executioner's block.\c"
M00180004,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)15 Pirates escaped with their lives…
And only a single bottle of loqua between them…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180005,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Pretty little lasses, all around the town…
Don't fall in love with a man of the skies…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180006,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Heh heh! The one thing about being an Air Pirate
is that it's hard to stay out of trouble. It
just sorta seems to come looking for you…\e"
M00180007,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)That's why it's my job to make sure the
Albatross is always in good shape. Just in case
trouble comes looking for us, you know?\c"
M00180008,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Pretty little lasses, all around the town…
Don't fall in love with a man of the skies…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\c"
M00190000,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)You're the first visitor we've had in a long
time. Make yourself at home, miss, and don't be
afraid to ask for anything you need.\e"
M00190001,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)We Blue Rogues are friend to any travelers of
the skies. Well, if you're an armed traveler
with gold, it's a different story! Haha!\c"
M00200000,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Plundering treasure is fine, but just once I'd
like to find a well-built, handsome young man as
treasure instead of the usual.\e"
M00200001,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)… Of course, if I did that, I'd be just like a
Black Pirate instead of a Blue Rogue. Oh well, I
suppose that means it's off limits.\c"
M00200002,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)… But, to be honest, I really would like to
kidnap a man for myself someday! Hahaha…\c"
M00200003,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Vyse, if you're going out on a voyage,
make sure that you've equipped your best
weapons and armor.\e"
M00200004,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)An Air Pirate needs to be sure that his swords
and his wits are always sharp.\c"
M00200005,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)It looks like this this is it, Vyse.
The final battle… Are you really read
to fight Galcian and Ramirez?\e"
M00200006,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Now that I think about it, that Ramirez
fellow was actually a pretty good-looking guy.
I'm so bad… Hehehe…\c"
M00210000,\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)Everyone got captured while I was sleeping!\e
M00210001,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I was going to try and chase them down, but
the Valuans destroyed the Albatross…\e"
M00210002,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)What are we supposed to do now, Vyse?!
We have to try and help them somehow!\c"
M00210003,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)What are we supposed to do now, Vyse?!
We have to try and help them somehow!\c"
M00210004,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I've been so worried about Captain Dyne and the
others that I can't sleep at all…\e"
M00210005,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)You need to succeed in rescuing everyone so
that, if for any reason, I can get some
sleep again!\c"
M00210006,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I can't believe I overslept and everyone
else left without me… You figure they'd
wake me up or something…\c"
M00230000,"\h(《Dyne》)Now listen up, Vyse. There are times when
something other than brute strength or
sharpness of mind is demanded of a man.\e"
M00230001,"\h(《Dyne》)Sometimes you have to have a firm grasp of the
entire situation at hand. That's when you need
to learn how to be a Swashbuckler.\e"
M00230002,"\h(《Dyne》)People will notice how you behave in various
situations and you'll begin to earn a reputation
based on those actions.\e"
M00230003,"\h(《Dyne》)That's why you need to try and be as
adventuresome as possible, without forgetting
your leadership responsibilities, okay?\c"
M00230004,"\h(《Dyne》)Your “Swashbuckler Rating” is a quality that you
must cultivate in your words and actions every
day of your life. Never forget that.\c"
M00230005,"\h(《Dyne》)What's wrong, Vyse?
You're looking uncharacteristically grim.\e"
M00230006,"\h(《Vyse》)Dad… Actually, there's something that
I have to tell you…\e"
M00230007,"\h(《Dyne》)Don't worry…
I have a feeling that I already know
what you're going to say.\e"
M00230008,"\h(《Dyne》)I remember when I was your age… The feeling
that I had to get away from my own little island
and see the rest of the world.\e"
M00230009,"\h(《Dyne》)But when a man decides to step out onto his
own path, he doesn't need to ask for his
parents' permission.\e"
M00230010,"\h(《Dyne》)From now on, you are my equal, son.
A man who lives by the skies. There is
nothing more honorable than that…\e"
M00230011,"\h(《Dyne》)Heh… You're late on almost every other
occasion, but you sure aren't wasting any time
to try and get out on your own…\e"
M00230012,\h(《Vyse》)Dad…\e
M00230013,"\h(《Dyne》)Go on, get out of here, Vyse.
Go make your mark in the world.\c"
M00230014,"\h(《Dyne》)Go on, get out of here, Vyse.
Go make your mark in the world.\c"
M00230015,"\h(《Dyne》)Now listen up, Vyse. There are times when
something other than brute strength or
sharpness of mind is demanded of a man.\e"
M00230016,"\h(《Dyne》)Sometimes you have to have a firm grasp of the
entire situation at hand. That's when you need

M00230019,"\h(《Dyne》)Your “Swashbuckler Rating” is a quality that you
must cultivate in your words and actions every
day of your life. Never forget that.\c"
M00230020,"\h(《Dyne》)Heh heh heh. I feel remarkably calm
considering that the enemy is about
to hit me with the best of their best.\e"
M00230021,"\h(《Dyne》)But that's good. It puts the crew at
ease if the captain looks like he's
calm and fully in control.\e"
M00230022,"\h(《Dyne》)But, it all comes down to this battle. I've got
to keep my eyes open and just keep my men alive.
You need to do the same, too, Vyse.\e"
M00230023,"\h(《Dyne》)To constantly push your crew forward while
maintaining a grasp of the complete situation…
That is the essence of leadership.\c"
M00230024,"\h(《Dyne》)To constantly push your crew forward while
maintaining a grasp of the complete situation…
That is the essence of leadership.\c"
M00240000,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)Ungh…
I haven't been home in such a long time,
please… just let me sleep.\c"
M00240001,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)Ungh… huh?
Is it morning already?
C'mon… just let me sleep a little bit longer…\c"
M00240002,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)Since everyone is back home again, I just felt
so relaxed… then I… just… sorta got… tired…\c"
M00240003,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I promise I won't oversleep this time,
so just let me sleep a little, okay?\c"
M00290000,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Sorry, Vyse…
I wish you never had to see
Pirate Isle like… this…\e"
M00290001,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)But, I hear you're going to Valua to try and
rescue everyone. You're crazy, you know that?
But, I'll be praying for your safety…\c"
