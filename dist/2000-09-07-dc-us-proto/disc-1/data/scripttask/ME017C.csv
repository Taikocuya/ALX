M14050000,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey Vyse, how's it going? 
Still trying to explore as much of the world as
you can, I see.\e"
M14050001,\h(《Domingo》)Well then… let me check out your Discovery Log.\e
M14050002,"\h(《Domingo》)Ah, you've made \c Discoveries!\e"
M14050003,"\h(《Domingo》)I'm disappointed in you, Vyse! If this is the 
best you can do, you'll never be 
remembered as a great explorer.\e"
M14050004,"\h(《Domingo》)If you find any more artifacts, or make any more
discoveries, come back and see me. If you 
impress me, I'll make sure you are rewarded.\c"
M14050005,\h(《Domingo》)Hmm… You've made \c Discoveries.\e
M14050006,\h(《Domingo》)You haven't found much since I last saw you.\e
M14050007,\h(《Domingo》)I'll give you something when you find some more.\e
M14050008,"\h(《Domingo》)Not bad, you've made \c Discoveries!\e"
M14050009,"\h(《Domingo》)That's much better, Vyse. You've done 
extraordinarily well. I wouldn't expect less 
from a renowned sailor like yourself.\e"
M14050010,"\h(《Domingo》)As I promised, I'll reward you.\e"
M14050011,\h(　)You got (gift at 30)!\e
M14050012,"\h(《Domingo》)If you make some more Discoveries, 
I'll reward you again.\e"
M14050013,"\h(《Domingo》)Wow, you've made \c Discoveries!"
M14050014,"\h(《Domingo》)That's the spirit! Finding someone with 
a Discovery Log as full as yours would be 
a discovery in itself.\e"
M14050015,"\h(《Domingo》)Like I promised… here's a little
something I put together for you.\e"
M14050016,\h(　)You got (gift at 40)!\e
M14050017,"\h(《Domingo》)Once you make 50 Discoveries, I'll give you
another present.\c"
M14050018,\h(《Domingo》)Whoa! You've made \c Discoveries!\e
M14050019,"\h(《Domingo》)Now THAT'S impressive! 
You really are something else!\e"
M14050020,"\h(《Domingo》)You're one of the greatest explorers 
of our time. You've earned this!\e"
M14050021,\h(　)You received 1 ”Phantom Ring.”\e
M14050022,"\h(《Domingo》)Now, if you can completely fill up your
Discovery Log, then I will give you 
my most prized possession!\c"
M14050118,"\h(《Domingo》)Wow!
You've made ＊＊ Discoveries already!\e"
M14050119,"\h(《Domingo》)You really are great, Vyse!
Not many people can boast discovering this many
things a single lifetime, you know.\e"
M14050120,"\h(《Domingo》)You really are the greatest Air Pirate that ever
lived! Well, I believe so, anyway. But, like I
promised, here's your gift!\e"
M14050121,\h(　)You got (gift at 40)!\e
M14050122,\h(　)You received 1 ”Phantom Ring.”\e

M14050025,"\h(《Domingo》)Vyse, you are one of the greatest explorers in 
history! Not even the Legendary Daccat can
measure up to you!\e"

You can have my title as ”Treasure Hunter

M14050049,"\h(《Domingo》)Vyse! You are the greatest explorer the world
has ever known!\e"
M14050050,\h(《Domingo》)It is an honor to have met you.\c
MI0020000,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm…
It's still hard for me to believe that Izmael
turned this deserted island into a base.\e"
MI0020001,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse…
Aika…
Enrique…\e"
MI0020002,"\h(《Fina》)Thank you for everything you've done. So far,
we've managed to get three of the Moon Crystals.\e"
MI0020003,"\h(《Fina》)I never would have made it this far on my own. 
Thank you so much.\e"
MI0020004,"\h(《Aika》)Come on, Fina!
You don't have to thank us!\e"
MI0020005,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, if it wasn't for you, I don't think we
would've ever gotten the chance to sail around
the world! We should be thanking you!\e"
MI0020006,"\h(《Enrique》)Fina, I don't know if you realized it yet, but
your mission has helped us all. And we've all
grown to be such good friends.\e"
MI0020007,\h(《Fina》)Yes… Thank you… I mean you're welcome.\e
MI0020008,"\h(《Fina》)Until recently, I lived a sheltered life. I was
scared when the elders asked me to search
for the Crystals… And I was alone.\e"
MI0020009,"\h(《Fina》)Since then, I've made some great friends,
and I get excited when we explore new lands…
Even the ones with monsters.\e"
MI0020010,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah… when you first heard what we did for a
living, you seemed really surprised… almost
intimidated.\e"
MI0020011,"\h(《Vyse》)You're sounding more like an Air Pirate every
day. Before you know it, you'll be dressing like
us… and Cupil will be wearing an eye patch.\e"
MI0020012,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, that reminds me.
Do you know where we should go to get the next
Moon Crystal?\e"
MI0020013,"\h(《Fina》)Yes, I do.\e"
MI0020014,"\h(《Fina》)To the far south, lies a land that basks in the 
cold light of the Purple Moon. 
It is known as the Land of Ice.\e"
MI0020015,\h(《Fina》)The Purple Moon Crystal should be hidden there.\e
MI0020016,\h(《Vyse》)Land of Ice?\e
MI0020017,"\h(《Fina》)The Purple Moon is the source of power for 
all Ice Magic.\e"
MI0020018,"\h(《Fina》)And because of that, the lands under the moon 
have become encased in ice.\e"
MI0020019,"\h(《Aika》)I've heard stories about that place… Some of 
the others back home used to tell me about 
the rumors they'd hear.\e"
MI0020020,"\h(《Aika》)I heard that the air is so cold, that anyone who
goes there will be frozen solid in a matter of
seconds…\e"
MI0020021,"\h(《Aika》)I don't want to have to chisel you out of the
ice, Vyse.\e"
MI0020022,"\h(《Vyse》)Where do you get these stories? First, I was 
going to catch on fire, then people were going 
to eat us with sticks, now I'm going to freeze.\e"
MI0020023,"\h(《Vyse》)Getting the Crystal is not going to be easy, 
but I think your overactive imagination is 
getting the best of you.\e"
MI0020024,"\h(《Aika》)What do you mean?!
Alright… fine. When you become a Vysicle,
don't come crying to me!\e"
MI0020025,"\h(《Fina》)Hahaha…
I'm sure everything will be alright.
I doubt it's that cold, Aika.\e"
MI0020026,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, according to our Valuan archaeologists…\e"
MI0020027,"\h(《Enrique》)Beneath the layers of ice, lies the ruins of an
ancient city. The ruins have been undisturbed
since the Old World.\e"
MI0020028,"\h(《Enrique》)Unfortunately, no one has ever been able to
break through the ice… All we have been able to
do is observe the ruins from the sky.\e"
MI0020029,"\h(《Vyse》)So we don't really need to go there because 
it's impossible to get the Crystal.\e"
MI0020030,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, I was thinking…
Brabham said that the hull had been reinforced,
right?\e"
MI0020031,"\h(《Enrique》)If the hull is strong enough to break
throughstone reefs, perhaps it is strong
enough to break through the ice!\e"
MI0020032,"\h(《Vyse》)That might work! We could bust through the ice
with the Delphinus!\e"
MI0020033,"\h(《Fina》)If the Delphinus can get through the ice, 
then we can get the Crystal.\e"
MI0020034,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah.
Then it looks like our next destination is to
the south… to the Land of Ice!\e"
MI0020035,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it looks like we've got a long journey
ahead of us. I think we should take the rest of
the day off and celebrate!\e"
MI0020036,\h(《Everyone》)Aye Aye!\e
MI0100000,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright… we've got the Purple Crystal. 
All that's left are Yellow and Silver.\e"
MI0100001,"\h(《Fina》)The Silvite elders already have the Silver 
Crystal.\e"
MI0100002,"\h(《Fina》)So we really only have to worry about the Yellow
Crystal.\e"
MI0100003,\h(《Aika》)It looks like our mission is almost finished.\e
MI0100004,"\h(《Aika》)But wait… wasn't the Yellow Crystal located in
the Maw of Tartas in Valua?\e"
MI0100005,"\h(《Aika》)Last time we went there, we couldn’t get in
because the opening was sealed.\e"
MI0100006,"\h(《Enrique》)Yes, the Valuans have made several unsuccessful
attempts at removing the seal…\e"
MI0100007,"\h(《Enrique》)But, perhaps we might be able to bypass the seal
with the Delphinus' new engine.\e"
MI0100008,"\h(《Enrique》)According to the geologists of the Valuan
Empire…\e"
MI0100009,"\h(《Enrique》)The lower layers of the Valuan Islands are
filled with cracks and fissures.\e"
MI0100010,"\h(《Enrique》)In other words, there is a whole system of 
subterranean tunnels running through Valua.\e"
MI0100011,"\h(《Aika》)So all we have to do is fly around underneath 
Valua and look for an opening.\e"
MI0100012,"\h(《Vyse》)I see…
So, in other words, if we can't get in from the
top, we'll try and get in from the bottom!\e"
MI0100013,"\h(《Vyse》)We'll fly below Valua and look for an opening
underneath the island! Once we get inside the
tunnels, we should be able to find the Crystal.\e"
MI0100014,"\h(《Aika》)Since we can fly higher and lower than we ever
have before, we might as well take advantage of
it.\e"
MI0100015,"\h(《Vyse》)Exactly.
Let's rest up today. We'll leave for Valua first
thing tomorrow morning.\e"
MJ0010000,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, long time no see!
Wow… you've got yourself a nice little base set
up here!\e"
MJ0010001,\h(《Vyse》)Gilder!\e
MJ0010002,"\h(《Gilder》)I heard that you sailed around the world! 
As always kid, it sounds like you've been trying
to get yourself into more trouble…\e"
MJ0010003,"\h(《Gilder》)I came here to hear all about your travels… 
that, and for a good meal.\e"
MJ0010004,"\h(《Vyse》)Haha… 
Good old Gilder… 
Pleasure before business…\e"
MJ0240000,"\h(《Gilder》)…so you went to Yafutoma and then on to the
Land of Ice, huh? Just listening to your stories
makes my adrenaline flow.\e"
MJ0240001,"\h(《Gilder》)And so in the end, you collected the 
five Moon Crystals… Nice work.\e"
MJ0240002,"\h(《Aika》)Yup, we got them all!\e"
MJ0240003,"\h(《Gilder》)And since all of them are together, I suppose 
that means Fina will be taking them with her 
when she heads home soon…\e"
MJ0240004,\h(《Fina》)…Yes.\e
MJ0240005,"\h(《Gilder》)Actually…
There was something that was bothering me from 
earlier…\e"
MJ0240006,"\h(《Gilder》)Fina… where exactly did you come from? I mean, 
where are you going home to?\e"
MJ0240007,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MJ0240008,\h(《Aika》)Fina?\e
MJ0240009,"\h(《Fina》)The place to which I must return…
The place where both Ramirez and I were born and
raised…\e"
MJ0240010,"\h(《Fina》)…is the Great Silver Shrine. It is in a place,
high above the sky… \e"
MJ0240011,\h(《Vyse》)The Great… Silver Shrine?\e
MJ0240012,"\h(《Fina》)Long ago, when the Rains of Destruction fell 
upon the lands, and most of the world's 
population was killed… All seemed lost…\e"
MJ0240013,"\h(《Fina》)The most powerful Silvite mages met at the 
Shrine. They combined their energy to send it 
into the sky… above the destruction.\e"
MJ0240014,"\h(《Fina》)They escaped the horrible fate that fell upon 
the rest of the world, by rising above the 
destruction.\e"
MJ0240015,"\h(《Fina》)Ever since then… from above… we have sworn to 
protect the people of this world from the same 
fate that our ancestors suffered.\e"
MJ0240016,"\h(《Fina》)That is the primary mission of the remaining 
Silvites.\e"
MJ0240017,"\h(《Fina》)The Great Silver Shrine is high above the 
clouds, where no ship can reach it…\e"
MJ0240018,"\h(《Fina》)I plan to take the Moon Crystals back to the 
Great Silver Shrine. So that no one will ever be
able to abuse their power again.\e"
MJ0240019,"\h(《Enrique》)But…
How are you going to get home?\e"
MJ0240020,"\h(《Fina》)If I can get back the ship that I came in, 
then I should be able to make it home.\e"
MJ0240021,"\h(《Fina》)But, when I was attacked by Valua, my ship sank
beneath the clouds… \e"
MJ0240022,"\h(《Vyse》)Yes, I remember… you're talking about that ship
you were flying when Alfonso attacked you.\e"
MJ0240023,"\h(《Enrique》)Hmm… it appears that we must find another way
of getting Fina home.\e"
MJ0240024,"\h(《Aika》)But…
If we find a way to get Fina back home…\e"
MJ0240025,"\h(《Aika》)…does that mean we'll have to say good-bye?
We'll never get to see her again…\e"
MJ0240026,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MJ0240027,"\h(《Fina》)Lately…
I sometimes find myself thinking…\e"
MJ0240028,"\h(《Fina》)…I started thinking, if I am unable to find a
way home…\e"
MJ0240029,"\h(《Fina》)…that I'll be able to stay here, with everyone.\e"
MJ0240030,"\h(《Fina》)Haha… I'm sorry… that's so silly of me.
My orders were to gather the Moon Crystals and
to return to the Great Silver Shrine with them…\e"
MJ0240031,\h(《Vyse》)…\e
MK0050000,\h(《Fina》)…Yes?\e
MK0050001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's me…
I came by to see if you're okay.\e"
MK0050002,\h(《Fina》)Oh… Vyse…\e
MK0050003,"\h(《Fina》)I'm sorry, but…
Could I just be alone for a while?\e"
MK0050004,\h(《Vyse》)Fina…\e
MK0050005,"\h(《What will you say?》)”I understand…”
”Everyone's worried about you…”\e"
MK0050006,"\h(《Vyse》)I understand if you still need to work things 
out.\e"
MK0050007,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, everyone is worried about you. 
If there's anything we can do to help…\e"
MK0050008,"\h(《Fina》)…I know… but, I… I need to sort out a few
things before I can… talk to anyone.\e"
MK0050009,"\h(《Fina》)I'm sorry to have worried you…
But, please… I need just a little more time to 
myself.\e"
MK0050010,\h(《Vyse》)… Okay.\e
MK0050011,"\h(《Vyse》)I'll be back later.
Fina… don't give up, okay?\e"
MK0050012,"\h(《Fina》)Elders…
Was Ramirez speaking the truth?\e"
MK0050013,"\h(《Fina》)What…
What am I supposed to do?
Who am I supposed to believe?\e"
MK0050014,"\h(《Aika》)Alright everyone!
Lift on three, okay?\e"
MK0050015,"\h(《Izmael》)As soon as we get this rubble out of the way, 
we can start building again! I can't wait…\e"
MK0050016,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey! I'm a guest here!!
Why… why am I stuck…
doing this kind of… work?!\e"
MK0050017,\h(《Aika》)Aww… quit… your… griping! \e
MK0050018,\h(《Marco》)This reminds me of Lower City… \e
MK0050019,"\h(《Clara》)What are you talking about?
Everyone is safe! We should be happy that nobody
was seriously hurt… \e"
MK0050020,"\h(《Brabham》)Nothin' lasts forever… that's why we build new 
stuff. In my prime, I would have rebuilt half of
the island already! \e"
MK0050021,"\h(《Lawrence》)They're too quick!
Somebody cast a spell or something!\e"
MK0050022,"\h(《Belle》)Ouch! 
I'm so tired… \e"
MK0050023,\h(《Fina》)Maybe my life is better now than it ever was… \e
ML0030000,"\h(《Moegi》)Vyse…
I… I heard that something terrible
has happened…\e"
ML0030001,"\h(《Vyse》)Moegi… I'm afraid… that…
Galcian used the Rains
of Destruction on Valua… \e"
ML0030002,"\h(《Moegi》)What?!
But… but what about Enrique?!
Is he…?\e"
ML0030003,\h(《Moegi》)No… he… he can't be…\e
ML0030004,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse, if we don't do something soon, Galcian
will destroy the world one island at a time.
We have to stop him.\e"
ML0030005,\h(《Vyse》)I know… I'm working on it.\e
ML0030006,\h(《Aika》)How are we supposed to stop him?!\e
ML0030007,"\h(《Aika》)His base is an entire continent, and there's 
that shield around it… \e"
ML0030008,"\h(《Gilder》)Looks like there's not much we can do except
take on Galcian himself.\e"
ML0030009,"\h(《Gilder》)But, we can't even get to him…\e"
ML0030010,\h(《Vyse》)Damn! There's nothing we can do! \e
ML0030011,"\h(　)Oh, yes there is.\e"
ML0030012,"\h(《Enrique》)I leave you guys alone for a few days,
and you're ready to surrender?\e"
ML0030013,"\h(《Vyse》)Enrique, you're alive!!!\e"
ML0030014,\h(《Moegi》)Enrique!!!\e
ML0030015,"\h(《Enrique》)Moegi…
It's alright, I'm okay.\e"
ML0030016,\h(《Moegi》)I was so worried about you… \e
ML0030017,"\h(《Enrique》)We were in Valua when the Rains hit.
Belleza saved me. I owe her my life.\e"
ML0030018,"\h(《Enrique》)My mother, and so many others were killed… \e"
ML0030019,"\h(《Enrique》)We can't let this happen again! We must stop
Galcian… \e"
ML0030020,\h(《Aika》)But… how?\e
ML0030021,"\h(《Belleza》)Lord Galcian wants to rule the world,
not destroy it. Valua was just an example.\e"
ML0030022,"\h(《Belleza》)Now that he's made his example, he can demand
allegiance from all of the other countries… \e"
ML0030023,"\h(《Belleza》)He will send his Armada to each of the countries
as a show of force, and demand that they
surrender. He will most likely go with them.\e"
ML0030024,"\h(《Vyse》)You’re right! Once he's out of his base, we'll
have a shot at him.\e"
ML0030025,"\h(《Gilder》)Vyse, I know that you aren't too keen on giving
up, but we need to be realistic here.\e"
ML0030026,"\h(《Gilder》)There's no way the Delphinus can take out
Galcian's entire fleet.\e"
ML0030027,"\h(《Belleza》)He's right. If you fought him, you would lose.\e"
ML0030028,"\h(《Aika》)But, there has to be a way… \e"
ML0030029,\h(《Aika》)We can't just give up… \e
ML0030030,\h(《Vyse》)Dammit!\e
ML0030031,"\h(　)What's wrong, boy?!\e"
ML0030032,"\h(　)”No matter what happens, I'll never give up!”
You told me that once… or are you all talk?!\e"
ML0030033,"\h(《Vyse》)……!
That voice!\e"
ML0030034,"\h(《Drachma》)Boy…
It's been a long time.\e"
ML0030035,\h(《Vyse》)Captain!\e
ML0030036,\h(《Drachma》)Soltis is the root of all of our problems… \e
ML0030037,"\h(《Drachma》)We've got to send that place back to Deep Sky,
where it belongs!\e"
ML0030038,\h(《Vyse》)But… \e
ML0030039,"\h(《Fina》)But…
We don't stand a chance against the entire
Armada.\e"
ML0030040,"\h(　)Well, Fina…
Have you forgotten about me already?\e"
ML0030041,\h(《Fina》)Clara!\e
ML0030042,"\h(《Clara》)Don't forget, I'm an Air Pirate, too!
I can't just sit around and let Galcian take
over the world!\e"
ML0030043,"\h(《Gordo》)That new continent has driven away all of the
food… Now I don't have any customers!
That's more than enough reason for me to fight!\e"
ML0030044,"\h(《Centime》)Vyse, I heard what was going on.
We must fight together, for the future of this
world!\e"
ML0030045,"\h(《Baltor》)Humph!
I can't believe I'm doin' this!\e"
ML0030046,\h(《Vyse》)Baltor?!\e
ML0030047,"\h(《Baltor》)Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm only helping you because I hate Galcian
more than I hate you.\e"
ML0030048,"\h(《Baltor》)As soon as we kick his arse,
I'm coming after ya!\e"
ML0030049,"\h(《Daigo》)If there's a fight to be fought, then you can
count us in.\e"
ML0030050,"\h(《Daigo》)You saved our country…
Now, it is time to return the debt of honor!\e"
ML0030051,"\h(《Jao》)We, the Tenkou…\e"
ML0030052,\h(《Mao》)…will also aid you.\e
ML0030053,\h(《Fina》)Vyse…\e
ML0030054,"\h(《Aika》)With this many ships, we may just stand a chance
against the Armada!\e"
ML0030055,"\h(　)Aika, just because we're a little late… 
Don't count us out.\e"
ML0030056,\h(《Vyse》)Dad!!\e
ML0030057,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse…
You've done quite a bit of growing up since I
last saw you.\e"
ML0030058,"\h(《Dyne》)If you have this many allies, you must be quite
a Captain! I'm proud of you son.\e"
ML0030059,\h(《Vyse》)Thank you!\e
ML0030060,"\h(《Gilder》)Alright! Captain, we await your orders!\e"
ML0030061,\h(《Vyse》)Okay!\e
ML0030062,"\h(《What will you say?》)”We can't let Galcian get away with this!”
”Let's show Galcian what we're made of!”\e"
ML0030063,\h(《Vyse》)We can't let Galcian get away with this!\e
ML0030064,"\h(《Vyse》)We need to take back the skies and free the
world!\e"
ML0030065,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's send him and Soltis into Deep Sky… 
forever!\e"
ML0030066,\h(《Vyse》)Let's show Galcian what we're made of!!\e
ML0030067,\h(　)Yeah!\e
ML0030068,"\h(《Vyse》)Tonight, I want everyone to rest up.
Tomorrow, we make history!!!\e"
ML0030069,"\h(《Aika》)It looks like this is it! 
I think I'm going to like this!\e"
