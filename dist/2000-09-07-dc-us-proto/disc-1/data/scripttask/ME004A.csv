MB0050000,\h(《Vyse》)Captain Drachma!\e
MB0050001,"\h(《Drachma》)Will you stop callin' me that?
You don't sail with me anymore. Therefore, I'm 
no longer your ”Captain”.\e"
MB0050002,"\h(《Aika》)Really? Oh, that's too bad.\e"
MB0050003,"\h(《Aika》)I heard about a cannon that might be able to
take out Rhaknam, but since you're no longer
sailing with us…  I guess it doesn't matter…\e"
MB0050004,\h(《Drachma》)… What did you say?\e
MB0050005,"\h(《How do you want to explain it?》)”Come right out and say it”
”Beat around the bush”\e"
MB0050006,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, in Valua, there's something called a 
”Harpoon Cannon”. It's the most powerful cannon
there is.\e"
MB0050007,"\h(《Vyse》)Cap… Err… Drachma, you could go to Valua and
get one yourself… and take us along for
the ride. What do you say?\e"
MB0050008,"\h(《Drachma》)Hmm…
It's probably just some trick to get me to take
you to Valua…\e"
MB0050009,"\h(《Vyse》)Wait a minute!
I'm telling you the truth!\e"
MB0050010,"\h(《Vyse》)You know, I was amazed when I saw Rhaknam… I've
never seen an arcwhale that big before. I used
to think that he was indestructible…\e"
MB0050011,"\h(《Vyse》)Until I knew that there was a cannon that could 
destroy him… But, you're not sailing with us 
anymore… So, I guess it doesn't really matter…\e"
MB0050012,"\h(《Vyse》)Gee, Aika…
I'd do anything for a ride to Valua…
I wonder who can get us there…\e"
MB0050013,"\h(《Drachma》)Are you trying to bargain with me, boy?!\e"
MB0050014,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, since you put it so eloquently…
If we are going to give you information that 
will help you, we expect you to help us.\e"
MB0050015,\h(《Drachma》)Hrmph!\e
MB0050016,"\h(《Polly》)Now that I think about it, I remember hearing
about something like that!\e"
MB0050017,"\h(《Polly》)Some Valuan soldiers passing through here were 
talking about it one day. They said it had 
enough power to destroy a small island…\e"
MB0050018,"\h(《Drachma》)…Polly, I hope you aren't takin' their side and
lyin' to me…\e"
MB0050019,"\h(《Polly》)When, Drachma, have I EVER lied to you, huh?\e"
MB0050020,\h(《Drachma》)Hmm…\e
MB0050021,"\h(《Polly》)And besides. I can tell these kids aren't lying 
by the looks in their eyes.\e"
MB0050022,"\h(《Polly》)I've been running this tavern for 20 years
Drachma… I know people. I can spot cheats and
liars… and these children are neither…\e"
MB0050023,\h(《Drachma》)……\e
MB0050024,"\h(《Drachma》)… Alright.
I won't get my hopes up, but I'll take you to 
Valua anyway.\e"
MB0050025,\h(《Aika》)What?! That means…\e
MB0050026,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrmph…
If you want to go, you'll have to work the 
ENTIRE way, but I'll take you there…\e"
MB0050027,\h(《Vyse・Aika》)Alright!\e
MB0050028,"\h(《Aika》)Cap'n, you're the best!
And thank you, too, Polly! Thank you for 
believing us…\e"
MB0050029,\h(《Drachma》)Hrmph…\e
MB0050030,"\h(《Polly》)Don't sweat it. When you're done with your 
adventure, come back and tell us about it. This 
crusty old bunch is dying for some fresh tales.\e"
MB0050031,"\h(《Aika》)Aye aye, ma'am!
It's the least I can do!\e"
MB0050032,"\h(《Polly》)Hahaha… alright… but be careful. Valua isn't
known for their hospitality… They usually shoot
first and ask questions later.\e"
MB0050033,"\h(《Drachma》)She's right.
Also, we'll need an entry passport to get in.\e"
MB0050034,"\h(《Drachma》)Unfortunately, I don't have one… but I'm sure 
someone here on Sailor's Island has one!\e"
MB0050035,"\h(《Vyse》)Valuan passport, huh?
Alright! Let's go look for one…
Captain Drachma!\e"
MB0050036,\h(　)Drachma has joined your party!\e
MB0060000,"\h(《Vyse》)Is this the Sailor's Guild?
I need some information… \e"
MB0060001,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Oh!
If you have any questions about sailing, you're 
in the right place!\e"
MB0060002,"\h(《Vyse》)I need to get a Valuan Passport sometime… um…
soon. Do you know how I can do this?\e"
MB0060003,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hmm…
A Valuan Passport soon, huh?
That might be a little difficult…\e"
MB0060004,"\h(《Guildmaster》)After the initial application, there's an
 intensive background check… and that can take 
up to a full lunar cycle.\e"
MB0060005,"\h(《Aika》)We can't just sit around for a lunar cycle!!!
You're the guild master here, right? 
Can't you make a fake passport or something?!\e"
MB0060006,"\h(《Guildmaster》)NO NO NO NO… No way!
If anyone is caught making or carrying a fake 
passport, they're executed on the spot!\e"
MB0060007,"\h(《Aika》)So, what you're saying is that all we have to do
is not get caught, right? Or, if we do get 
caught, all we have to do is escape.\e"
MB0060008,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I don't want the Valuans after me! If I make a
fake, and you get caught, they might be able to
trace it back to me! Then, I'm a dead man.\e"
MB0060009,"\h(《Aika》)You call yourself a Guildmaster, huh? 
You're just a Valuan puppet…
Let's go find someone else!\e"
MB0060010,\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Um… excuse me…\e
MB0060011,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)So, you are looking for a Valuan Passport, eh?\e"
MB0060012,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I was in Valua on business and now I'm on my
way　home. I don't need this one anymore.\e"
MB0060013,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I have but one request to ask of you, and the 
passport is yours.\e"
MB0060014,"\h(《Aika》)Really? You have a passport?!
What do you want? Anything… ask us anything!\e"
MB0060015,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I'm a merchant from the Kingdom of Nasr. 
Nasr is located on a desert island to the east
of here.\e"
MB0060016,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I've heard rumors that the Black Pirate, Baltor,
has been seen in the skies near there…\e"
MB0060017,"\h(《Drachma》)Baltor, huh?
I've heard of him. He's ruthless… He attacks 
unarmed ships and steals their cargo.\e"
MB0060018,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)And, what I wanted to ask of you was, well, if 
you could escort me back to Nasr.\e"
MB0060019,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)If you get me safely to Nasr, then I will give 
you the passport when we arrive.\e"
MB0060020,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I think it is an even trade, yes?\e"
MB0060021,"\h(《What will you do?》)”We accept your offer!”
”No thanks we'll find something else…”\e"
MB0060022,"\h(《Vyse》)We accept your offer!
It's a deal.\e"
MB0060023,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)You accept?
You are wise beyond your years, young one.\e"
MB0060024,\h(《Aika》)Just leave it to us! We'll protect you!\e
MB0060025,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrmph…
Well, if we want to get into Valua, I suppose we
have no other choice.\e"
MB0060026,"\h(《Vyse》)It's alright…
we'll find some other way to get a　passport.
Nasr is too far out of the way for us.\e"
MB0060027,"\h(《Aika》)What are you talking about, Vyse?!
Aren't we supposed to help those who need us? 
We're Blue Rogues, remember!?\e"
MB0060028,"\h(《Aika》)Besides, do you have any other plans on how to 
get into Valua if we turn down this offer?\e"
MB0060029,"\h(《Drachma》)Hmm…
It appears that we have no other choice at this 
point.\e"
MB0060030,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)So you accept my offer?
Excellent. I leave myself under your protection.\e"
MB0060031,\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I shall be waiting for you at the docks.\e
MB0060032,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright. We'll finish up here and meet you at 
the Little Jack.\e"
MB0120000,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
So this is Sailor's Island.\e"
MB0120001,"\h(《Aika》)I've never been here before, but I can already
tell that this place is lots of fun! Yup,
I think I'm gonna like it here.\e"
MB0120002,"\h(《Drachma》)Good, after I restock my supplies here,
I'm leavin' again. You two can stay here.\e"
MB0120003,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, wait a second!
We have no ship!
Are you planning to just strand us here?!\e"
MB0120004,"\h(《Drachma》)I've got to find Rhaknam… and in the meantime,
I have to find a cannon that is powerful enough
to destroy him.\e"
MB0120005,"\h(《Drachma》)I have no time to waste with you kids. You two 
can resolve your own problems.\e"
MB0120006,"\h(《Aika》)This is just great! 
He's not listening to anything we're saying!\e"
MB0120007,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder if there's anything that will make the 
old man change his mind…\e"
MB0120008,"\h(《Vyse》)Maybe we can dig up some information. Let's go 
around town and see what we can find.\e"
MB0120009,\h(　)Drachma has left the party.\e
MJ0120000,\h(《Vyse》)Enrique… are you really going?\e
MJ0120001,"\h(《Enrique》)I am the Prince of Valua.
I must return home to warn 
everyone of Galcian's plans.\e"
MJ0120002,"\h(《Enrique》)Gregorio was willing to give his life for what 
he believed in. I must do the same.\e"
MJ0120003,\h(《Enrique》)You… all of you… taught me so much.\e
MJ0120004,"\h(《Enrique》)About ships…
About the sky…
What it means to fight…\e"
MJ0120005,"\h(《Enrique》)And… you taught me that there are all kinds of 
people in this world… People worth fighting
for! People worth dying for!\e"
MJ0120006,"\h(《Enrique》)I want to protect them… all of them!
I want to build a country where 
the people don't have to live in fear.\e"
MJ0120007,"\h(《Enrique》)…Please forgive me for leaving your side, but 
I've got to save Valua!\e"
MJ0120008,"\h(《What will you say?》)”Be careful!”
”Can't you think this over?”
”Don't get airsick, okay?”\e"
MJ0120009,"\h(《Vyse》)Be careful out there!
You better come back and visit us at Crescent
Isle someday!\e"
MJ0120010,"\h(《Enrique》)Sure.
I'll be back to see you…
and for Princess Moegi!\e"
MJ0120011,"\h(《Vyse》)Enrique…
It's too dangerous for you to go.
Can't you think this over?\e"
MJ0120012,"\h(《Enrique》)Hahaha, I never thought I would ever hear the 
amazing Vyse say the words ”too dangerous.”\e"
MJ0120013,"\h(《Enrique》)”No matter what happens, we can't give up.”
Someone once told me those words…\e"
MJ0120014,"\h(《Enrique》)So, Vyse… taking your advice, I won't give up.
I will stop the Armada!\e"
MJ0120015,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't get airsick, okay?
You're a sailor now, Enrique…
and sailors don't get airsick!\e"
MJ0120016,"\h(《Enrique》)Thanks, Vyse…
It means a lot to me to be accepted as a fellow
sailor by you…\e"
MJ0120017,"\h(《Enrique》)I can't promise that I won't get sick anymore,
but I swear that I won't embarrass the Delphinus
or her crew!\e"
MJ0120018,\h(《Fina》)Enrique! Be careful!\e
MJ0120019,"\h(《Aika》)If you don't come back and visit us,
I'm coming after you!\e"
MJ0120020,"\h(《Enrique》)Thank you, everyone!
I'll never forget our travels together!\e"
MJ0120021,\h(　)Enrique has left the party.\e
M01000000,"\h(《Polly》)You must be new around here… I don't recognize
your face. Well, I hope you make yourself at
home here. My tavern is your tavern.\c"
M01000001,"\h(《Polly》)Let me introduce myself. My name is Polly.
I'm the owner of this place.\e"
M01000002,"\h(《Polly》)I was married to a sailor, but rumor has it he
got shipwrecked and he's been missing ever
since.\e"
M01000003,"\h(《Polly》)But for some reason, I simply can't believe that
my husband is dead.\e"
M01000004,"\h(《Polly》)So I keep this place open in hopes that he'll
drift back in someday.\c"
M01000005,"\h(《Polly》)Feel free to drop by anytime you're in the area.
I'm quite an accomplished cook, so you can come
here and fill your stomachs with home-cooking!\c"
M01000006,"\h(《Polly》)Well, well, long time no see.
How've you kids been?\e"
M01000007,"\h(《Polly》)Those Air Pirates that everyone's been talking
about… the ones that have been pushing Valua
around… that's you kids, isn't it?\e"
M01000008,"\h(《Polly》)Heh… Don't worry. I won't turn you in to the
Valuans. In my tavern, whether you're a pirate
or a soldier, you're a customer all the same.\c"
M01000009,"\h(《Polly》)Why don't you make yourself comfortable and stay
awhile? Oh yeah, if anyone gives you kids a hard
time, just let me know. I'll take care of 'em.\c"
M01000010,"\h(《Polly》)So, you kids are recruiting new members for your
crew?\e"
M01000011,"\h(《Polly》)Well, you've come to the right place. They don't
call it Sailors' Island for nothing. I'm sure
you'll find plenty of candidates for your crew.\e"
M01000012,"\h(《Aika》)Actually, Polly, we were wondering if maybe
you'd like to join our crew?\e"
M01000013,"\h(《Aika》)We'd be delighted if you would come with us and
be our cook. You're probably the best cook we
know…\e"
M01000014,"\h(《Polly》)What? You want me to be your cook?
This is a joke, right?\e"
M01000015,"\h(《Polly》)Well, ever since the sailor that I married got
shipwrecked during one of his voyages to the
east…\e"
M01000016,"\h(《Polly》)I've had to make ends meet by running this
tavern with my only daughter Anne.
I can't suddenly just pick up and leave.\e"
M01000017,"\h(《Anne》)Why not, Mother? Go ahead and go.\e"
M01000018,"\h(《Anne》)You've always said, Mother, that you wished you
had a ship so you could go and look for Father.\e"
M01000019,"\h(《Anne》)I don't even remember my father's face, you
know. If anything, do it for me.
Go find my father and bring him home.\e"
M01000020,"\h(《Anne》)Don't worry about the tavern.
I can take care of things while you're away.\c"
M01000021,\h(《Polly》)Anne…\e
M01000022,"\h(《Polly》)… Thank you, Anne. I will find your father and
bring him home to show him what a wonderful
daughter he has. I promise.\e"
M01000023,"\h(《Polly》)Well, I guess this is it, then.
If you were serious about your offer,
I'd be happy to join your crew. \e"
M01000024,"\h(《Polly》)Leave the ship's galley to me!
I'll cook up lots of tasty food loaded with
nutrition.\e"
M01000025,\h(　)Polly has joined your crew as a “Cook.”\c
M01010000,\h(《Anne》)Come right in! Welcome to Polly's Place.\e
M01010001,"\h(《Anne》)The specialties of the house are “Steam-baked
Maroccas” and “Ocean Style Meatpies.”\e"
M01010002,"\h(《Anne》)And then there's Polly's own special
Mistral Loqua.\e"
M01010003,"\h(《Anne》)Oh, I haven't properly introduced myself.
I'm Polly's  daughter, Anne.
I hope to see you around!\c"
M01010004,"\h(《Anne》)I've been working in this tavern for quite some
time and I don't think I've seen you around
these parts before. Stay and enjoy the food!\c"
M01010005,"\h(《Anne》)Hello there, Mr. Vyse! Haven't seen you in a
while. Welcome back to Polly's Place.\e"
M01010006,"\h(《Anne》)You should drop in more often whenever you're in
the neighborhood.\c"
M01010007,"\h(《Anne》)Don't worry about the tavern. I can take care of
it. I don't have your 20 years experience as a
tavernkeep…\e"
M01010008,"\h(《Anne》)But I do have nearly 10 years experience as a
waitress. I know everything I need to know to
run the place!\c"
M01010009,"\h(《Anne》)Oh, Mr. Vyse! Thank you so much for finding my
father! You don't know how grateful I am!\e"
M01010010,"\h(《Anne》)I saw him for the first time just a little while
ago down by the waterfront. He even remembered
me! I was so happy!\e"
M01010011,"\h(《Anne》)It kind of startled me at first how wild he
looked… I mean, with his long, tangled hair and
everything.\e"
M01010012,"\h(《Anne》)But I guess that can't be helped… he was
marooned for so long. And besides, it doesn't
change the fact that he's my father!\c"
M01010013,"\h(《Anne》)We promised each other that someday he and
Mother and I would all run the tavern together.
I can hardly wait!\c"
M01010014,"\h(《Anne》)Hello there, Mr. Vyse! Haven't seen you in a
while. Welcome back to Polly's Place.\e"
M01010015,"\h(《Anne》)I'm happy to say, business has been good.
Please let my mother know that she doesn't need
to worry about a thing.\c"
M01020000,"\h(《Sailor》)Every time I come back to Sailors' Island, my
first stop is always at Polly's Place. Her
cooking is just so good!\e"
M01020001,"\h(《Sailor》)Ahh! All it takes is one meal, and I feel
totally refreshed for my next journey no
matter what it is!\c"
M01020002,"\h(《Sailor》)Alright then! Today I'm going to kick back
andfeast like there's no tomorrow.\c"
M01020003,"\h(《Sailor》)Polly may have left the tavern, but cute little
Anne is keeping things going very nicely.\e"
M01020004,"\h(《Sailor》)The food is as good as ever, so all of us
regulars keep coming back without missing
a thing.\c"
M01020005,"\h(《Sailor》)I don't know what's been going on outside, but
no sailor worth his salt lets the little things
bother him.\e"
M01020006,"\h(《Sailor》)Sailors must maintain complete calm at all
times! Sit in your usual tavern and just eat
your food! That's the way to be.\c"
M01030000,"\h(《Sailor》)This guy seems like he really likes a good meal.
It looks like he spends all of his profits on
food!\e"
M01030001,"\h(《Sailor》)It's hard to tell whether he eats to sail or
he sails to eat.\c"
M01030002,"\h(《Sailor》)Anne has been working really hard at the tavern,
trying out some new menu items and things like
that.\e"
M01030003,"\h(《Sailor》)I'm sure she must miss her mother, but she
doesn't show it a bit. I guess it just goes to
show that she's her mother's daughter.\c"
M01030004,"\h(《Sailor》)Even when that weird island came floating up
from beneath the clouds, Anne never let it
bother her.  \e"
M01030005,"\h(《Sailor》)“No matter what happens, I intend to keep this
tavern open just like always,” she said.\e"
M01030006,"\h(《Sailor》)It made me feel all warm inside when I heard her
say that. And so I decided that I'd keep coming
here just like always.\c"
M01040000,"\h(《Female Sailor》)This island is a gathering spot for sailors and
traders. Keep your ears open and you'll hear all
sorts of interesting rumors and information.\c"
M01040001,"\h(《Female Sailor》)You know, I once thought I wanted to have my own
tavern like this…\e"
M01040002,"\h(《Female Sailor》)But don't you think it's actually kind of
romantic to sail the skies looking for a lost
husband, too?\c"
M01040003,"\h(《Female Sailor》)Oh, I wish I could find a man who could make me
give up everything else and just chase after him
to the ends of the world.\c"
M01040004,"\h(《Female Sailor》)Sigh… I hope, just once, that I fall deeply in
love before I die…\c"
M01050000,"\h(《Sailor》)Did you know? Over in Valua there's a humongous
fortress that's as big as a mountain?\e"
M01050001,"\h(《Sailor》)It's called the Grana or the Gracha or something
like that. I forget!\c"
M01050002,"\h(《Sailor》)Did you know? Beyond the stone reef, at the
entrance to the desert, there's an oasis city.\e"
M01050003,"\h(《Sailor》)It's called Mardaba or Muratada or something
like that. Hehe… I forget!\c"
M01050004,"\h(《Sailor》)Did you know? On the southern edge of the
continent of Nasr, there's an old city that's
been forgotten.\e"
M01050005,"\h(《Sailor》)It's called Esa or Ese or something like that.
Hehe… I forget!\c"
M01050006,"\h(《Sailor》)Did you know? Those bastards from Valua have
started constructing some kind of weird thing
beneath the clouds…\e"
M01050007,"\h(《Sailor》)It's called Dungal or Dangol or something like
that. Hehe… I forget!\c"
M01050008,"\h(《Sailor》)Did you know? That huge landmass that appeared
from beneath the clouds is apparently an ancient
continent of some old legend.\e"
M01050009,"\h(《Sailor》)It's name? How should I know? The world's coming
to an end… I don't really care anymore!\c"
M01060000,"\h(《Merchant》)Lately the Valuan Empire has been expanding at
an astonishing pace! I can't help but worry…\e"
M01060001,"\h(《Merchant》)They say this man called Lord Galcian who
commands the Armada is responsible for their
success…\c"
M01060002,"\h(《Merchant》)I heard rumors of a fearless Air Pirate who
managed to break out of Valua's Grand Fortress.\e"
M01060003,"\h(《Merchant》)I wonder how he got out alive? They always said
the only way out of that place was in a coffin.\c"
M01060004,"\h(《Merchant》)There seem to be quite a few Green Moon Stones
on the market recently, wouldn't you say?\e"
M01060005,"\h(《Merchant》)I understand Valua's been mining Moon Stones on
the new continent in the west. Some of those
Stones are finding their way here.\c"
M01060006,"\h(《Merchant》)Did you hear? A Valuan prince has been kidnapped
by Air Pirates.\e"
M01060007,"\h(《Merchant》)You'd think a prince would be well-protected
inside the empress' palace. Nobody can figure
out how they managed to pull it off.\c"
M01060008,"\h(《Merchant》)Word is that the Admirals Belleza and Vigoro of
the Armada sailed west for some reason… but
came running back in great haste.\e"
M01060009,"\h(《Merchant》)I wonder what happened out west?
It sure would be nice to know.\c"
M01070000,"\h(《Nasr merchant》)Hello, travelers! I am a merchant from the
country of Nasr, a land that lies east of here.\e"
M01070001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)This area is known as Ocean, and if you sail to
the north you will reach Valua.\e"
M01070002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Because this island is situated halfway between
Nasr and Valua, it's become the perfect spot for
traders to exchange information.\e"
M01070003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Perhaps you should talk with people around town,
as well. You never know what sort of information
you might come across…\c"
M01070004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)The Ship Parts Merchant finally has some goods
to sell again.\e"
M01070005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)And I even heard that the Weapons Merchant has
new stuff on sale, so you should go check it
out!\c"
M01070006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)There's a lot of talk about the new continent
lately. Well, it's not really “new,” but I
believe it is called Ixa'taka…\e"
M01070007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)But I heard that Valua invaded it and forced
the natives to work as slaves mining for
Moon Stones.\c"
M01070008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Word is that the Nasr capital, Nasrad, has been
attacked by the Armada and reduced to ruins…\e"
M01070009,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I used to know quite a few merchants in Nasrad…
Osman among others. It worries me when I think
about their well-being…\c"
M01070010,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Those damned Valuans, they're building some kind
of new base beneath the clouds just west of this
island.\e"
M01070011,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I can't imagine what they could possibly be
planning to do with a base in a place like that.\c"
M01080000,"\h(《Sailor》)It's so good to be on solid ground! Oh lovely
ground! Oh sweet, solid ground! It feels so good
just to be able to roll around like this!\e"
M01080001,"\h(《Sailor》)Ahh, nothing beats being on solid ground!
No more rolling motion! No more tilting!
It's so beautiful!\c"
M01080002,"\h(《Sailor》)I can hardly believe it but they say there's
some amazing fellow who managed to bust out of
the Valuan Grand Fortress!\e"
M01080003,"\h(《Sailor》)To think that he busted through those massive
steel walls! Man! It's too incredible!\c"
M01080004,"\h(《Sailor》)Word is that someone blasted a huge hole in the
gate of the Grand Fortress.\e"
M01080005,"\h(《Sailor》)They're saying the same guy who escaped from
Valua before is the one who is responsible for
it. Man! It's too incredible!\c"
M01080006,"\h(《Sailor》)A former Black Pirate has opened a restaurant in
the North Ocean.\e"
M01080007,"\h(《Sailor》)The food's supposed to be amazing, and it's all
you can eat. Makes my mouth water.
I'd sure like to go sometime.\c"
M01080008,"\h(《Sailor》)Something absolutely unimaginable has come
floating up from beneath the clouds!\e"
M01080009,"\h(《Sailor》)What does this mean?!
Why are there islands appearing out of nowhere?!
The world must be coming to an end…\c"
M01090000,"\h(《Girl on Street》)They say a lot of Black Pirates have been seen
in the area lately…\e"
M01090001,"\h(《Girl on Street》)Black Pirates are extremely evil outlaws who
steal gold and kidnap women.
You better watch out, okay?\c"
M01090002,"\h(《Girl》)To the south of here, there's an area surrounded
by stone reefs and sky rifts.\e"
M01090003,"\h(《Girl》)If you have a ship that can make it through the
stone reefs, you'll probably be able to make a
lot of Discoveries in that area.\c"
M01090004,"\h(《Girl on Street》)I suddenly heard this huge roar,
so I hastily flew out to see what it was…\e"
M01090005,"\h(《Girl on Street》)And what I found, I'll never forget…
I saw a huge island rising up from beneath the
clouds! I couldn't believe my eyes!\c"
M01100000,"\h(《Guildmaster》)This is the Sailor's Guild. You can get
information about ships and general sailing tips
here.\e"
M01100001,"\h(《Guildmaster》)We also purchase information on Discoveries
made throughout the world!\e"
M01100002,"\h(《Guildmaster》)So, if you've made any Discoveries, just let us
know. We'll pay you handsomely for the
information.\e"
M01100003,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell Discovery information.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M01100004,"\h(《Guildmaster》)People have been known to find ancient
artifacts, rare animals and plants, or even
strange land formations.\e"
M01100005,"\h(《Guildmaster》)When you are traveling through the skies, if you
notice anything unusual, be sure to check it
out. If you're lucky, you might find something.\e"
M01100006,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Oh, yes, one more thing… whenever you fly near
a possible Discovery, your compass will begin
to spin wildly.\e"
M01100007,"\h(《Guildmaster》)So whenever you notice your compass acting
strangely, check out the area right away.\c"
M01100024,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Our guild collects information from throughout
the world so we constantly hear rumors of
possible new Discoveries.\e"
M01100025,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Every once in a while, we will sell information
on possible Discoveries that we've heard rumors
about.\e"
M01100026,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Of course, we can't pay much money for the
whereabouts on any Discoveries that someone
else might have already discovered.\e"
M01100027,"\h(《Guildmaster》)But, we'll still pay you for confirming the
existence of the Discovery. But, the faster you
find them, the more we will pay you!\c"
M01100008,"\h(《Guildmaster》)In every port of any size, you will always find
a branch office of the Sailors' Guild.
I suggest you pay a visit.\c"
M01100011,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Aren't you the one they call Vyse the Ninny?
Nice nickname. How'd you earn it?\e"

All right. I'll pay.\e"

you see it. I have no use for you then.
Get lost!\c"

Now, listen carefully…\e"
M01140029,"\h(《Pinta》)If you send me out using the “VMU Minigame”

battle with storms and even other ships.\e"

gain experience, money, and items!\e"

already prepared. Please make yourself
comfortable and enjoy your stay.\e"
M01160004,"\h(《Innkeeper》)I hope you slept well.
May the Moons guide you in your journeys.\e"
M01160006,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Hm…
It appears that you do not have enough gold.
Perhaps you should come back another time.\c"
M01160005,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Oh, you're not going to stay? Well, it's your
choice, but it can be very refreshing to
spend a night on land now and then, you know.\c"
M01170000,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey there, big guy. How's the sailing going?
This is a ship parts shop specializing in big
guns and stuff.\e"
M01170001,"\h(《Ship Parts Dealer》)But actually, I just ran out of stock. I'm
waiting for the next shipment to arrive, so
I'm actually a little bored right now.\e"
M01170002,"\h(《Ship Parts Dealer》)Why don't you stay and talk for a while? I don't
have anything better to do and I might have some
information that might interest you.\e"
M01170003,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Listen to what the merchant has to say.”
“Leave.”\e"
M01170004,"\h(《Vyse》)So tell me. What's this “information” that you
have?\e"
M01170005,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)I'm glad you asked, big guy. It's something I
heard from a sailor on his way back from Valua…\e"
M01170006,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)He says that the Ship Parts Dealers in Valua has
started selling a gun they call a
“Harpoon Cannon.”\e"
M01170007,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)It's some sort of giant spear-like weapon that
they mount on the front of your ship… and it's
connected by a rope or something.\e"
M01170008,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)And from what I hear, because there's a rope
attached, you can just reel that spear-like
thing back into your ship. Saves money on ammo!\e"
M01170009,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)I expect it packs a real punch. With a weapon
like that, even a small ship can probably
hold its own against larger ships.\e"
M01170010,"\h(《Vyse》)A Harpoon Cannon, huh?\e"
M01170011,"\h(《Aika》)You know, we just might be able to use this
information to try and convince Cap'n Drachma
to take us to Valua.\c"
M01170012,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by. I should be getting a
shipment of parts sometime soon, so make sure
to check back with me again, okay?\c"
M01170013,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)I'm all out of stock right now, but I should be
getting a shipment of parts sometime soon, so
make sure to check back with me again, okay?\c"
M01170014,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, hey there! How are you doing? I finally got 
in my new shipment of parts, so I'm back in 
business!\e"
M01170015,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)And to celebrate, I have plenty of “Secondary
Cannons” on sale! Make sure to purchase at least
one before you go!\e"
M01170016,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Ask what a Secondary Cannon is.”
“Leave.”\e"
M01170017,"\h(《Vyse》)So, what's this “Secondary Cannon” that you were
talking about?\e"
M01170018,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)“Secondary Cannons” are cannons that you can
fire for more than one round in a row! They are
extremely useful.\e"
M01170019,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)You can fire them well into the following round,
allowing you to concentrate more firepower into
specific rounds!\e"
M01170020,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Each individual shot may not be as strong as
your Main Cannon, but it's always best to have
a balance of everything, right?\e"
M01170021,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by! I get shipments of new
parts every now and then, so be sure to come
back soon!\c"
M01170022,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Ninny. Are you sure
you can handle firing one of my cannons? They
make really loud noises you know. HAHAHAHA!!\e"
M01170023,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey there! I've got cannons for all your
destructive needs! Take a look around!\e"
M01170024,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey there! I've got cannons for all your
destructive needs! Take a look around!\e"
M01170025,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, you're the guy they call Vyse the
Determined, right? Why don't you buy a cannon
from me? I know you'll put it to good use!\e"
M01170026,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Respected. Thanks for
stopping by my shop! Do you want to buy
something while you're here?\e"
M01170027,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, it's Vyse the Admirable! I never expected
you to come to my shop!\e"
M01170028,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, it's Vyse the Bold! I never expected to see
you in here! Have you come here to buy some
cannons?\e"
M01170029,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, it's Vyse! You're so lucky… you get to
have people call you “Vyse the Valiant.” I wish
that someone would call me valiant…\e"
M01170030,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, it's Vyse! You're so lucky… you get to
have people call you “Vyse the Daring.” I wish
that someone would call me valiant…\e"
M01170031,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh! Hey, you're Vyse the Dashing! Come on… you
have to buy something from me! That way I can
brag to all of my friends!\e"
M01170032,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, it's you! Vyse the Fearless! Hey um… is it
true? Did you open the gate to the Grand Fortess
with your bare hands? Heh… I guess not…\e"
M01170033,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)V, Vyse the Hero! You're here! Well… you have
to buy something from me! It'll make me feel
like I'm a part of history!\e"
M01170034,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, you're the King of Rogues! I'm so glad that
you're not a Black Pirate. Otherwise, I'd
probably never get any of my shipments!\e"
M01170035,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Welcome! I am honored to have you in my shop,
Vyse. You truly are a living legend!\e"
M01170036,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M01170037,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Although at first glance, you Main Cannon's
attack power may not look significant, it is
actually affected by the strength of the user.\e"
M01170038,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)So, if someone strong fires the Main Cannon, it
will do a lot more damage!\e"
M01170139,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)However, Secondary Cannons and Torpedos are
unaffected by the strength of the person firing
them.\c"
M01170039,\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by! Come again!\c
M31050000,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey Captain…
can we talk to you a minute?\e"
M31050001,"\h(《Drachma》)I have nothing to talk to you kids about.
Get lost!\c"
M90390000,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)I am known as the Mystery Merchant!
I travel the world selling my exotic wares!\e"
M90390001,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)I have items that you may never see anywhere
else! Come, take a look for yourselves!\e"
M90390002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M90390003,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Being a sailor, you probably already know this,
but there are many different kinds of fish that
swim the skies.\e"
M90390004,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Some fish are more valuable than others, but
they are also harder to find. If you can catch
one, it'll be well worth your trouble!\c"
M90390005,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Thank you very kindly.
I hope that our paths cross again someday.\c"
M90400005,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey, are you the guy that everyone is talking
about? Vyse, right? I heard that you broke out
of the Grand Fortress! Good job!\e"
M90400006,"\h(《Domingo》)I'm sure you've heard of me during your travels.
I am Domingo, Treasure Hunter Extraordinaire!\e"
M90400007,"\h(《Domingo》)Huh? You've never heard of me, you say? Now,
now… You don't need to be so bashful. I know
you're truly excited to meet real Domingo!\e"
M90400008,"\h(《Domingo》)Nevertheless, I have given up on searching for
lost treasures and have taken up a new quest!
I now search the world for Artifacts!\e"
M90400009,"\h(《Domingo》)In fact, I am in the midst of my search for the
fabled “Topple Rock.”\c"
M90400010,"\h(《Vyse》)Who was that? He seemed to be just a little more
than full of himself…\e"
M90400011,"\h(《Aika》)I don't know, but it sounds like he's looking
for Artifacts, too.\e"
M90400012,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we can't let him get the best of us! We'll
just have to find them before he does!\c"
