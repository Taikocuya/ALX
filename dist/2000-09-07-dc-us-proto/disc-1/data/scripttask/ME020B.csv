MH0170000,\h(《Vyse》)This must be it!\e
MH0170001,\h(《Deep Voice》)Trespassers…\e
MH0170002,\h(《Deep Voice》)…halt.\e
MH0170003,\h(《Jao》)Westerners…\e
MH0170004,\h(《Mao》)…it appears that we meet again.\e
MH0170005,"\h(《Vyse》)Aww, not them again!
What are you doing here?!\e"
MH0170006,\h(《Jao》)This is the headquarters…\e
MH0170007,\h(《Mao》)…of the Tenkou.\e
MH0170008,\h(《Jao》)It was very foolish…\e
MH0170009,\h(《Mao》)…for you to come here.\e
MH0170010,\h(《Jao》)The time has come…\e
MH0170011,\h(《Mao》)…for us to finish you.\e
MH0170012,\h(《Loud Voice》)Halt!!\e
MH0170013,"\h(《Warrior》)Jao, Mao… Who's there?\e"
MH0170014,\h(《Jao》)Lord Daigo…\e
MH0170015,\h(《Mao》)These are the Westerners…\e
MH0170016,\h(《Jao》)…that dared to defy us.\e
MH0170017,\h(《Mao》)They came through the Dark Rift… \e
MH0170018,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm Vyse of the Blue Rogues.
You're the leader of the Tenkou?\e"
MH0170019,\h(《Moegi》)Daigo!\e
MH0170020,\h(《Vyse》)What?! He's your brother?\e
MH0170021,"\h(《Aika》)Huh?!
This is Prince Daigo!?\e"
MH0170022,"\h(《Daigo》)Moegi!
How have you been?\e"
MH0170023,"\h(《Daigo》)I never would have thought that you would bring
foreigners to my temple.\e"
MH0170024,"\h(《Moegi》)I never thought I would, either.
But what are the Tenkou doing here?!\e"
MH0170025,"\h(《Daigo》)A long time ago, the twins challenged me to a
fight. They wanted my sword, so I beat them
senseless.\e"
MH0170026,"\h(《Daigo》)And for some strange reason, they pledged their
loyalty to me. I've been their leader ever
since.\e"
MH0170027,"\h(《Daigo》)And I figured, as their leader, I could control
them a little, so they'd stop attacking
everyone.\e"
MH0170028,"\h(《Daigo》)Besides, who else do you know that has twin
bodyguards?! Hahahaha!\e"
MH0170029,"\h(《Aika》)Moegi… Is he really your brother? It's hard to
imagine that the two of you are related.\e"
MH0170030,"\h(《Fina》)I know he is a Prince… like Enrique… but it
seems that Princes in Yafutoma act differently
than Princes in Valua.\e"
MH0170031,"\h(《Daigo》)…But what is the purpose of your visit, Moegi?
Has Father changed his mind?\e"
MH0170032,\h(《Moegi》)Daigo… he…\e
MH0170033,"\h(《Daigo》)… What's wrong?
Did something happen to him?!\e"
MH0180000,"\h(《Daigo》)Kangan… that little runt! How could he backstab
our father and hand our country over 
to the Valuans?!\e"
MH0180001,\h(《Moegi》)Daigo…\e
MH0180002,"\h(《Daigo》)Moegi… I'm sorry. If I was still there, this
would never have happened. When I was exiled,
I welcomed the freedom!\e"
MH0180003,"\h(《Daigo》)I disregarded all of my duties and did whatever
I wanted, here in this temple.\e"
MH0180004,"\h(《Daigo》)But, now my people need me. I must go back there
and reclaim my title as Prince of Yafutoma!\e"
MH0180005,"\h(《Daigo》)Vyse, I can't thank you enough for saving my
sister.\e"
MH0180006,"\h(《Daigo》)Now, I must get ready for battle. I will fight
against Valua and give Yafutoma back to the
people!\e"
MH0180007,"\h(《Daigo》)I would be honored if you'd fight alongside of
me.\e"
MH0180008,"\h(《What will you say?》)”Of course!”
”I don't know about helping the Tenkou.”\e"
MH0180009,\h(《Vyse》)Of course we'll help! We share the same enemy.\e
MH0180010,"\h(《Daigo》)Excellent!
We will fight together and reclaim Yafutoma and
the Maga Sphere!\e"
MH0180011,\h(《Vyse》)I don't know about helping the Tenkou…\e
MH0180012,"\h(《Daigo》)What are you saying?!
Aren't you a pirate as well?\e"
MH0180013,"\h(《Daigo》)It is Jao and Mao's mission to gather weapons,
so they only attack armed ships. They might be
pirates, but they do have honor.\e"
MH0180014,"\h(《Daigo》)From what I've heard about the Blue Rogues, you
guys are one and the same! Gahahahaha!!!\e"
MH0180015,"\h(《Daigo》)Also, Lord Enrique…
I heard that you defended my sister from Muraji.\e"
MH0180016,\h(《Daigo》)My family thanks you for your bravery.\e
MH0180017,"\h(《Enrique》)I did only what is expected of a gentleman.
Think nothing of it.\e"
MH0180018,"\h(《Enrique》)…And, Prince Daigo, I know how you feel.
I, too, have been exiled from my lands.\e"
MH0180019,"\h(《Enrique》)I wish to change the views of my country by
changing the world around it.\e"
MH0180020,"\h(《Enrique》)And that is why I wish to aid you… 
from one exiled prince to another.\e"
MH0180021,"\h(《Enrique》)Also, the fleet that you are about to face… the
Armada… was sent here by my mother, Empress
Teodora.\e"
MH0180022,"\h(《Enrique》)As a Valuan Prince, it is my duty to stop them.
This is not only your battle… it is mine as
well.\e"
MH0180023,\h(《Daigo》)…I understand. I will gladly accept your aid.\e
MH0180024,"\h(《Daigo》)Prince Enrique… you are a very noble man. 
Much more noble than I.\e"
MH0180025,"\h(《Daigo》)If a man such as yourself were to be at my
sister's side, I would sleep well at night.\e"
MH0180026,"\h(《Enrique》)Um…
I… um…\e"
MH0180027,\h(《Moegi》)Daigo…!\e
MH0180028,"\h(《Daigo》)And from the looks of it, the two of you
wouldn't mind either.\e"
MH0180029,"\h(《Daigo》)Now then… Vyse. I need to prepare for the
battle… Meet me at the port. We will depart for
Yafutoma as soon as you are ready.\e"
M09000000,"\h(《Tenkou》)This is our headquarters where our leader, Lord
Daigo, resides. When preparing for battles, Lord
Daigo gathers all of the Tenkou here.\e"
M09000001,"\h(《Tenkou》)Just a little while ago, Lord Daigo issued an
order for all the Tenkou to assemble.
It smells like a war…\e"
M09000002,"\h(《Tenkou》)It appears that Lord Daigo will be returning to
Yafutoma. From now on, Jao and Mao will be
leading the Tenkou.\e"
M09000003,"\h(《Tenkou》)We have decided that we should only take weapons
from those with evil intent.
You Blue Rogues have inspired us…\e"
M09010000,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)We, the Tenkou, are citizens of Yafutoma.
No matter how long you live away from it, you
never forget your love for your country.\e"
M09010001,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)So, we consider Kangan's treason to be a very
serious matter. I know you are not even from
Yafutoma… but, please… we need your help.\e"
M09010002,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)I never would have thought that the Winds of
Retribution would be the winds caused by Bluheim
flapping its wings…\e"
M09010003,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)Even though they are from the same islands,
Bluheim is quite different from the little
Hamachous living around here.\c"
M09010004,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)Our leaders Jao and Mao, as well as the other
Tenkou, are not here right now. I think they
flew westward.\e"
M09010005,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)They said that an important war had begun in a
country to the west…\e"
M09020000,"\h(《Tenkou》)Heh heh… a battle!
We haven't had a decent fight in a long time!\e"
M09020001,"\h(《Tenkou》)The Armada? I don't know who they think they
are, but they'll learn not to underestimate us!\e"
M09020002,"\h(《Tenkou》)You guys are pretty tough!
I can't believe you defeated that huge bird!\e"
M09020003,"\h(《Tenkou》)I didn't realize that there were warriors as
tough as you guys outside of Yafutoma!
You're really something!\e"
M09030000,\h(《Hamachou》)Kii kii!\e
M09030001,\h(《Hamachou》)Kak kak!\e
M09030002,"\h(《Hamachou》)Kii kii kii, kii!\e"
M09040000,"\h(《Kangan》)I, I don't believe that I've been exiled to a
place like… this!\e"
M09040001,"\h(《Kangan》)I, I am not supposed to be treated like this!! I
am the Royal Advisor! This is unheard of!\c"
M09040002,"\h(《Kangan》)King Mikado sent a messenger here just a little
while ago. It appears that in his sovereign
wisdom, he has forgiven us.\e"
M09040003,"\h(《Kangan》)I… I cannot believe that he had the compassion
to forgive such traitorous villains like
ourselves…\e"
M09040004,"\h(《Kangan》)We cannot disappoint him. We will return to
Yafutoma and work for the betterment of the
country. We must… for King Mikado.\c"
M09040005,"\h(《Kangan》)We will return to Yafutoma and work for the
betterment of the country.\c"
M09050000,"\h(《Muraji》)Daigo has commanded us to clean this shrine
every day!\e"
M09050001,"\h(《Muraji》)Why does someone of my status have to clean such
a filthy thing?!\e"
M09050002,"\h(《Muraji》)I used to be against touching anything that I
deemed filthy.
I thought it was below my station…\e"
M09050003,"\h(《Muraji》)But recently, I've learned the value of working
with one's hands.
It makes me feel… alive.\e"
M09050004,"\h(《Muraji》)When we return to Yafutoma, I plan to try and
make something of myself… without my father's
help.\e"
M09050005,"\h(《Muraji》)When we return to Yafutoma, I plan to try and
make something of myself… without my father's
help.\e"
Ms020b000,"\h(《ヴァイス》)うわっ、恐い顔の石像だ。
ヤフトマーの神様なのかな？\c"
Ms020b001,"\h(《ヴァイス》)おおー、すごいヤリだ。
テンコウは武器を集めてたな。
これは戦利品ってわけか。\c"
Ms020b002,"\h(《ヴァイス》)扉は閉ざされている。
開きそうにないな。\c"
