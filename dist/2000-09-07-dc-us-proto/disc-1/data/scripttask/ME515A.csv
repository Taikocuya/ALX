MAC000000,"\h(《Would you like to try again?》)“I never give up!”
“I quit.”\c"
MA5150000,"\h(《Drachma》)We need to get in close to damage
that thing… But, there's no telling
what that thing will do.\e"
MA5150001,"\h(《Drachma》)Just keep an eye on the damage levels of
the ship, boy. We'll try and damage him
little by little.\c"
MA5150002,"\h(《Drachma》)It's too big… I don't even know where
to begin attacking it. Boy, where do
you think we should try attacking it?\e"
MA5150003,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Try attacking its head.”
“Try attacking its legs.”\e"
MA5150004,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's try attacking its head.
That might be its weak point.\e"
MA5150005,"\h(《Drachma》)Very well.
Increase our altitude.\c"
MA5150006,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's try attacking itd legs.
They're holding up that huge body,
so maybe they're its weak point.\e"
MA5150007,"\h(《Drachma》)Very well.
Decrease our altitude.\c"
MA5150008,"\h(《Drachma》)Okay, boy… you can continue attackin' if you
want, or you can back off and make repairs on
the ship.\e"
MA5150009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Keep attacking.”
“Back off and repair the ship.”\e"
MA5150010,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's continue attacking.
We need to keep damaging that thing,
even if we can only do it a little at a time.\e"
MA5150011,\h(《Vyse》)Let's back off and regroup for now.\e
MA5150012,"\h(《Where do you want to attack now?》)“Attack its head.”
“Attack its legs.”\c"
MA5150013,"\h(《Fina》)Look!
Grendel's acting strangely!\e"
MA5150014,"\h(《Aika》)Uh oh…
Why am I getting a bad feeling about this?\e"
MA5150015,"\h(《Drachma》)Wait… This might be our chance.
Watch it carefully…\e"
MA5150016,"\h(《Drachma》)It's not actin' normally. If we attack it now,
we might be able to knock it off balance.\e"
MA5150017,"\h(《Drachma》)And if we can hit it hard enough, we might
be able to knock it over into that valley
behind it. That should hold it for a while.\e"
MA5150018,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright!
We knocked Grendel into the valley!!\e"
MA5150019,"\h(《Drachma》)Good job, boy! Now is our chance to grab the
Green Moon Crystal and send that thing back
to where it came from!\c"
MA5150020,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Continue attacking.”
“Back off and regroup.”\c"
MA5150021,"\h(《Drachma》)What are you doing, boy?!
Hurry up and use the Harpoon Cannon!
It's our only chance!!\c"
