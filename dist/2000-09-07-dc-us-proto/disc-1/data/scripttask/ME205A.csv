MB001000,"\h(《Aika》)Visibility is horrible!
Vyse, the fog's too thick!
I can barely see!\e"
MB001001,"\h(《Vyse》)That's strange… there's never any fog in this 
region… I wonder what's causing it.\e"
MB001002,"\h(《Vyse》)The only way to get to Valua is through here…
Slow to half speed…\e"
MB001003,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, wait… we're too close to that island over
there!\e"
MB001004,\h(《Vyse》)What? Where?\e
MB001005,\h(《Aika》)Aaahh!\e
MB001006,\h(《Aika》)Vyse! Look!\e
MB001007,"\h(《Aika》)It… it's not an island!
Whatever it is… it's alive!\e"
MB001008,"\h(《Vyse》)What the…?!
It's an arcwhale!\e"
MB001009,\h(《Vyse》)I've never seen one this big before!\e
MB001010,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, we'll get killed if we get too close to 
it, but we've got to hurry to Valua.\e"
MB001011,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, what should we do?\e"
MB001012,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Attack it!”
”Retreat!”
”… I don't know!”\e"
MB001013,"\h(《Vyse》)We've got to hurry and it's in our way!
If we don't do anything, it'll probably knock us
out of the sky anyway!\e"
MB001014,"\h(《Aika》)What are you talking about, Vyse?! 
Are you crazy? How are we going to fight it in 
this little ship? We don't even have cannons!\e"
MB001015,"\h(《Aika》)What do you want to do… 10,000 Cutlass Furies?!
There's no way we can kill that thing! 
We'll be okay as long as it doesn't see us.\e"
MB001016,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you think we're going to do? Of course 
we're going to retreat! We don't stand a chance 
against that thing in this ship!\e"
MB001017,"\h(《Vyse》)I know we're in a hurry, but if that thing
capsizes us, everyone we know will be executed.
We'd better play it safe…\e"
MB001018,"\h(《Aika》)Okay.
I can't argue with that.
We'll be okay as long as it doesn't see us!\e"
MB001019,"\h(《Vyse》)… I don't know.
Aika, what do you think we should do?\e"
MB001020,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! Everyone is depending on you! If you want
to become a captain someday, you'll have to be
more decisive than that!\e"
MB001021,"\h(《Aika》)Without any cannons, there's no way we can take 
that thing out. It's best that we retreat! 
As long as it doesn't see us, we'll be okay!\e"
MB001022,\h(《Aika》)Aaaah!\e
MB001023,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!
It saw us!\e"
MB001024,"\h(《Vyse》)Grab hold of something and brace yourself!
Don't let go!\e"
MB001025,"\h(《Aika》)But… but…
The ship! It's breaking up!\e"
MB001026,\h(《Vyse・Aika》)Aaaaahhhhhh!!!\e
MB0070000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Captain Baltor!
There's a Nasr merchant ship coming into view 
off port-side!\e"
MB0070001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)But, there's a strange ship following it very 
closely… I don't recognize it's markings.\e"
MB0070002,"\h(《Baltor》)Gahahahahaha!
You have nothing to fear from a ship THAT old!\e"
MB0070003,"\h(《Baltor》)Let's introduce these fools to the true meaning
of fear! They will know that I, Baltor, sent
them plummeting to their deaths!!!\e"
MB0070004,\h(《Baltor》)Alright men! Battlestations!!!\e
MB0070005,"\h(《Baltor》)Don't let them escape! 
And take everything on board that isn't nailed 
down!\e"
MB0070006,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, there's a ship straight ahead, heading 
right for us! I see a black skull and… 
They're Black Pirates!\e"
MB0070007,"\h(《Vyse》)So that's Baltor, huh?
What should we do, Captain?\e"
MB0070008,"\h(《Drachma》)We're vastly outnumbered. Don't let them board 
us. We'll fight it out from a distance. Ready 
the cannons.\e"
MB0070009,"\h(《Drachma》)If you see them attack, I want you to go into 
evasive maneuvers. Then, when they're in your 
sights, blast them.\e"
MB0070010,"\h(《Vyse》)Aye aye, Captain!
Let's rip 'em a new one… Sir!\e"
MF0030000,\h(《Vyse》)Looks like we've reached Valuan airspace.\e
MF0030001,"\h(《Vyse》)So, this is where the Yellow Crystal is hidden,
right?\e"
MF0030002,"\h(《Fina》)Yes. It is sealed somewhere in these lands,
along with the Yellow Gigas.\e"
MF0030003,"\h(《Aika》)Considering how much trouble we've caused the
Valuans already, we should be extra careful,
right Cap'n?\e"
MF0030004,\h(《Drachma》)……\e
MF0030005,"\h(《Aika》)… Cap'n?
What's wrong?\e"
MF0030006,"\h(《Drachma》)Ah… um… nothing.
I'm sorry… were you saying something?\e"
MF0030007,"\h(《Aika》)Nothing really.
It wasn't anything important.\e"
MJ0110000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Captain Baltor!
There's a really, really powerful looking ship 
coming our way off port side!\e"
MJ0110001,"\h(《Air Pirate》)It's… the ship that everyone's talking about! 
The Delphinus! The one that the Blue Rogue, 
Vyse commandeers!\e"
MJ0110002,"\h(《Baltor》)GAHAHAHA!!!
So, Vyse… we meet again!\e"
MJ0110003,"\h(《Baltor》)This time, I have a little something special for
you!\e"
MJ0110004,"\h(《Baltor》)Alright men!
On the pride of the Black Pirates, 
kill them all!\e"
MJ0110005,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! Black Pirates, dead ahead!
Wait… hey! Isn't that Baltor's ship?!\e"
MJ0110006,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… looks like they've done a little work on 
their own ship as well! Let's go test out their
new defenses for them!\e"
