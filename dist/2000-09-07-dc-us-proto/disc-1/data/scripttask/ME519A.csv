“I quit.”\c"
MA5190000,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, just to let you know, the Delphinus is
equipped with Valua's newest, most powerful
weapon.\e"
MA5190001,"\h(《Enrique》)It's called the Moon Stone Cannon. Until
recently, it was only an experimental weapon
under development by Lord De Loco.\e"
MA5190002,"\h(《Enrique》)He used data collected from the Red and Green
Gigas to develop it. He says that this cannon's
power rivals the power of the Gigas themselves…\e"
MA5190003,"\h(《Enrique》)But, the manufacturing cost of this cannon is
so immense that this ship is the only ship in
the entire Armada equipped with one.\e"
MA5190004,"\h(《Aika》)Wow!! 
That means this ship is as powerful as a Gigas
then! I can't believe it!!!\e"
MA5190005,"\h(《Gilder》)Well then… Vyse, let's give her a test run,
shall we? Just use the “Special Attack” command
and we'll be good to go.\c"
