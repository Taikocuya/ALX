MC0200000,"\h(《Fina》)Thank you all so much for rescuing me from the 
Valuans. I hope that I will be able to repay all
of you, someday.\e"
MC0200001,"\h(《Dyne》)Just worry about keeping those Moon Crystals out
of the hands of the Valuans. And Vyse, we're all
counting on you too.\e"
MC0200002,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't worry Dad. I won't let you down!
Well… I guess we should get going…\e"
MC0200003,\h(《Aika》)We'll be back soon! Bye Cap'n! Bye Everyone!\e
MC0200004,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse…
Aika…
Are you sure you want to do this?\e"
MC0200005,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, there's no way we can turn this down. \e"
MC0200006,"\h(《Vyse》)After what you told us about the Gigas, I don't
even want to think about what the Valuan Empire
would do if they got their hands on them.\e"
MC0200007,\h(《Vyse》)We're the only ones that can stop them.\e
MC0200008,"\h(《Vyse》)And… well, to be completely honest…
I've always　wanted to sail the world,
and this is my chance…\e"
MC0200009,"\h(《Vyse》)Moon Crystals, lost cities, strange lands… I 
want to see them all with my own eyes! This is 
my chance to find out what's really out there.\e"
MC0200010,"\h(《Aika》)Fina, you couldn't stop us from going, even if 
you tried.\e"
MC0200011,"\h(《Aika》)This is the kind of adventure that Air Pirates 
dream of. If we passed this up, we'd regret it 
for the rest of our lives. \e"
MC0200012,\h(《Fina》)… I understand. Thank you! Thank you all!\e
MC0200013,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, do you have any idea where the Crystals
might be?\e"
MC0200014,"\h(《Fina》)Well, according to the ancient legends, there 
should be a Moon Crystal hidden in the lands 
under each of the moons.\e"
MC0200015,"\h(《Fina》)The closest ones from here are…
hmm… the Yellow　Moon of Valua…
and the Red Moon of Nasr.\e"
MC0200016,"\h(《Dyne》)Well, there's no chance of getting back into 
Valua right now. You should probably wait a 
while before going back there…\e"
MC0200017,"\h(《Dyne》)If you go East from here, you'll reach Nasr. 
With a normal ship, you'd probably never make it
through the stone reefs on the way…\e"
MC0200018,"\h(《Dyne》)But, now that the Little Jack is equipped with a
Harpoon Cannon, you've got a pretty good chance
of making it through.\e"
MC0200019,"\h(《Vyse》)Sounds like a plan.
We're heading East to Nasr and we're going to 
get that Red Moon Crystal.\e"
MC0200020,"\h(《Drachma》)We've been standing around here long enough. 
Let's get going.\e"
MC0200021,"\h(《Vyse》)Well… Dad, I guess it's time to say good-bye.\e"
MC0200022,"\h(《Dyne》)Remember everything I've taught you…
Make us proud, son…\e"

話をつけるのを忘れてたぜ。\c"
M00050000,"\h(《Martha》)Hey, Vyse! Where'd you get that new ship from?!\e "
M00050001,"\h(《Martha》)When you left here last time, you just had that
little ship… Now you've got that huge thing…
You must be doing well for yourself.\c"
M00050002,"\h(《Martha》)With a ship of that size, I suppose even the
Valuans leave you alone, don't they!\c"
M00060000,"\h(《Barbara》)Captain Dyne used to always say that a ship
is useless unless the whole crew works
together as a team.\e"
M00060001,"\h(《Barbara》)So, you take your father's advice and make sure
that you and your crew work together, okay? I
want you to make him proud!\c"
M00060002,"\h(《Barbara》)So, you take your father's advice and make sure
that you and your crew work together, okay? I
want you to make him proud!\c"
M00080001,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I hear that you've decided to leave.
Your father's told me all about it already.\e"
M00080002,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)But, I know you well enough to figure that it
wouldn't be long before you'd yearn to travel
the skies by yourself.\e"
M00080003,\h(《Vyse》)Mom…\e
M00080004,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)It's okay, dear. Everyone ultimately has to fly
away from their parent's nest. I knew it was
just a matter of when.\e"
M00080005,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I knew this day would be coming sometime.
It's just… It's just that it came a lot
sooner than I expected… or hoped.\e"
M00080006,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)So stand tall, son. Go chase after those dreams
that you've always talked about. And make sure
you take care of Aika, too, okay?\c"
M00080007,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Stand tall, son. Go chase after those dreams
that you've always talked about. And make sure
you take care of Aika, too, okay?\c"
M00135000,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hey there Vyse. Or should I say “Vyse the
Ninny?” Hehehe… I've heard stories of your
misadventures…\e"
M00135001,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse. You looking to buy something?\e"
M00135002,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well… if it isn't little Vyse the Determined.
Are you here to buy something?\e"
M00135003,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well… if it isn't little Vyse the Respected.
I've been hearing about your adventures lately.
Just make sure not to disappoint your father…\e"
M00135004,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Admirable. I laughed when I first heard
that one. But, I suppose if you've earned the
name, you deserve it…\e"
M00135005,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well, well… if it isn't Vyse the Bold. I heard
you're becoming quite the Air Pirate. Almost
better than your dad, from what I hear…\e"
M00135006,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Valiant… has a nice ring to it, eh?
I suppose you've earned the name… Just try
to live up to it, okay?\e"
M00135007,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)So, they call you “Vyse the Daring” now, eh?
Bah… I've known you since you were a baby. I'm
not sure if picking on Aika counts as “daring.”\e"
M00135008,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hahaha… If it isn't Vyse the Dashing! I wonder
who gave you that name… A lady, perhaps? I
wonder what Aika thinks about that…\e"
M00135009,"\h(《Zack the  Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Fearless… You know what? Ever since
people started calling you that, your dad hasn't
stopped bragging…\e"
M00135010,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)You've become quite the sailor, haven't you?
Not even your father was ever called a hero!
That's quite a name you've earned for yourself…\e"
M00135011,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse, King of Rogues… I wonder if your dad will
agree with that one… How about “Vyse, Prince of
Rogues…” I'm sure he'll like that one better.\e"
M00135012,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)I can't believe an annoying little kid like you
would grow up someday to become a living legend.
Heh… Well, I'm honored to know you, Vyse.\e"
M00130002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk to Zack.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00130003,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Most weapons are forged out of Moon Stones.
Well, it's not the only thing used, but it's
one of the main materials.\e"
M00130004,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)And since weapons are made of Moon Stones,
they can be affected by other Moon Stones
if used properly.\e"
M00130005,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)To learn all the details, ask at the training
center that's located above ground.\e"
M00130006,\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh. Thanks for stopping by.\c
M00130007,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Captain Dyne ordered me to keep all of
the weapons locked up.\e"
M00130008,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)That's probably so the other Pirates don't raid
my stock. Otherwise, how would I make money?
Hehehe…\c"
M00130009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Hear what Zack has to say.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00130010,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)If you intend to tangle with Valua, I
suggest you buy some powerful weapons.\e"
M00130011,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)We wouldn't want Captain Dyne's only son to
perish for want of a good blade… Heh heh heh.\e"
M00130012,\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh. Thanks for stopping by.\c
M00145000,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh… Hey, Vyse. You know what? I heard people
have been calling you “Vyse the Ninny” lately.
I wouldn't let it bother you too much, okay?\e"
M00145001,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh, hey there Vyse. You here to buy something?\e"
M00145002,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Determined.
Sounds like you're starting to make a name
for yourself, there. Your dad must be proud.\e"
M00145003,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey, Vyse! From what I hear, you're starting to
gain a lot of respect out there as a sailor!
Good for you…\e"
M00145004,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Vyse the Admirable… It's a suitable name, I
guess. I bet you're popular among the ladies…
Hahaha…\e"
M00145005,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse. You know what I just noticed?
You're starting to look a lot like your father.
Maybe it's the way you carry yourself, now…\e"
M00145006,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Valiant. That name
makes you sound so… honorable. Hahaha…
I'm sorry… I didn't mean to laugh…\e"
M00145007,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)“Vyse the Daring,” huh? I suppose it's a fitting
name… I don't know anyone who's as craz… er…
I mean… daring as you are.\e"
M00145008,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse the Dashing. You really seem
be making a name for yourself as a sailor these
days. Well, good for you, Vyse.\e"
M00145009,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)So, now they call you “Vyse the Fearless?”
Haha… I can remember when you were afraid of
the dark as a baby! My, how things change…\e"
M00145010,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Hero. That's quite a
nickname you've earned for youself, there. Just
make sure you live up to it, okay?\e"
M00145011,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)“The King of Rogues,” huh? Heh… I wonder who
gave you that nickname. It definitely wasn't
your dad, I'll tell you that…\e"
M00145012,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Wow… I never would have thought that you would
become a legend! Everyone here on Pirate Isle
is so proud of you…\e"
M00140001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to Erinn.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00140002,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Unlike spells that require MP, if you have a
healing crystal, you can recover your HP
anytime and anyplace.\e"
M00140003,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Some of the “tougher” Air Pirates refuse to use
them to save themselves, but I say it never
hurts to play it safe.\e"
M00140004,\h(《Erinn Item Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by. Come again!\c
M00140005,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Welcome home. I've set aside some special
items just for you and your crew.\e"
M00140006,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Use these items and make those Valuans
regret everything they've done to us!\e"
M00140007,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Hear what Erinn has to say.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00140008,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Don't worry about the injured, Vyse. I've got
plenty of Sacri Crystals in stock to take
care of everyone.\e"
M00140009,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)If all the Air Pirates never come home, I'll be
out of business. That's why I'm counting on you
to bring them all back, Vyse!\c"
M00150000,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)Since your ship is equipped with a Harpoon
Cannon, you should be able to ram your way
through stone reefs.\e"
M00150001,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)If you can get through the stone reef that lies
west of Sailors' Island, you can reach the
continent of Nasr.\c"
M00160000,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Thanks to the healing crystals that Erinn had,
all of my wounds have healed and I'm feeling
much better!\e"
M00160001,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Oh, and your new ship's called the Little Jack,
right? I'll resupply it for you, so you just
sit back and relax there, Vyse.\e"
M00160002,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Actually, every port has repair and restocking
centers, so your ship will automatically be
fixed as soon as you enter.\e"
M00160003,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)So, if you get into a ship battle and your ship
gets badly damaged, just get yourself to the
nearest port and you should be fine.\c"
M00160004,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Actually, every port has repair and restocking
centers, so your ship will automatically be
fixed as soon as you enter.\e"
M00160005,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)So, if you get into a ship battle and your ship
gets badly damaged, just get yourself to the
nearest port and you should be fine.\c"
M00170000,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Vyse… what you did back in Valua was amazing!
I've never seen you fight so hard before!
You've become quite the Air Pirate!\e"
M00170001,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne has trained you well. I'm sure
you'll make a fine captain someday just like
your father.\c"
M00170002,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Hey there, Vyse. How's the sailing been?\e"
M00170003,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne is proud of everything that you and
your crew have accomplished. Keep up the good
work, wherever you go.\c"
M00180002,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Sad is the fate of the captured Air Pirate…
They make his head part from his shoulders…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180003,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Man, that famous song almost came true for us.
We were so close to actually kissing the
executioner's block.\c"
M00180004,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)15 Pirates escaped with their lives…
And only a single bottle of loqua between them…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00200003,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Vyse, if you're going out on a voyage,
make sure that you've equipped your best
weapons and armor.\e"
M00200004,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)An Air Pirate needs to be sure that his swords
and his wits are always sharp.\c"
M00210000,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)You never cease to amaze me, Vyse.
I can't believe you've already found a ship!\e"
M00210001,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)It may be a little old, but it looks
like it's armed well enough to maybe even
take on the Armada!\c"
M00210002,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I think it's best to equip a ship with a well-
balanced array of main cannons, secondary
cannons, and torpedoes.\c"
M00230005,"\h(《Dyne》)What's wrong, Vyse?
You're looking uncharacteristically grim.\e"
M00230006,"\h(《Vyse》)Dad… Actually, there's something that
I have to tell you…\e"
M00230007,"\h(《Dyne》)Don't worry…
I have a feeling that I already know
what you're going to say.\e"
M00230008,"\h(《Dyne》)I remember when I was your age… The feeling
that I had to get away from my own little island
and see the rest of the world.\e"
M00230009,"\h(《Dyne》)But when a man decides to step out onto his
own path, he doesn't need to ask for his
parents' permission.\e"
M00230010,"\h(《Dyne》)From now on, you are my equal, son.
A man who lives by the skies. There is
nothing more honorable than that…\e"
M00230011,"\h(《Dyne》)Heh… You're late on almost every other
occasion, but you sure aren't wasting any time
to try and get out on your own…\e"
M00230012,\h(《Vyse》)Dad…\e
M00230013,"\h(《Dyne》)Go on, get out of here, Vyse.
Go make your mark in the world.\c"
M00230014,"\h(《Dyne》)Go on, get out of here, Vyse.
Go make your mark in the world.\c"
M00230015,"\h(《Dyne》)Now listen up, Vyse. There are times when
something other than brute strength or
sharpness of mind is demanded of a man.\e"
M00230016,"\h(《Dyne》)Sometimes you have to have a firm grasp of the
entire situation at hand. That's when you need
to learn how to be a Swashbuckler.\e"
M00230017,"\h(《Dyne》)People will notice how you behave in various
situations and you'll begin to earn a reputation
based on those actions.\e"
M00230018,"\h(《Dyne》)That's why you need to try and be as
adventuresome as possible, without forgetting
your leadership responsibilities, okay?\c"
M00230019,"\h(《Dyne》)Your “Swashbuckler Rating” is a quality that you
must cultivate in your words and actions every
day of your life. Never forget that.\c"
M00240002,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)Since everyone is back home again, I just felt
so relaxed… then I… just… sorta got… tired…\c"
M00240003,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I promise I won't oversleep this time,
so just let me sleep a little, okay?\c"
M00290000,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Sorry, Vyse…
I wish you never had to see
Pirate Isle like… this…\e"
M00290001,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)But, I hear you're going to Valua to try and
rescue everyone. You're crazy, you know that?
But, I'll be praying for your safety…\c"
M99990000,"\h(《Fina》)……? What's wrong, Cupil?\e"
M99990001,\h(《Cupil》)Squeak! Squeak!\e
M99990002,"\h(《Fina》)Really? Here? I see…
Vyse, Cupil tells me that there is a Cham
around here somewhere.\e"
M99990003,\h(《Vyse》)Cham? What's that?\e
M99990004,"\h(《Fina》)Chams are little shards from Moon Stones
that fell and shattered when they hit the
ground. Cupil eats them as food.\e"
M99990005,"\h(《Aika》)Really? Wow… I didn't know that anything
could eat Moon Stones! Where can you find
them? What do they look like?\e"
M99990006,"\h(《Fina》)You can find them all over the place, but
they're very small, so they're hard to see.\e"
M99990007,"\h(《Fina》)But, I'm sure Cupil will let you know whenever
we get close to a Cham. He can't seem to sit
still or be quiet whenever there's food nearby.\e"
M99990008,"\h(《Vyse》)I see. So all we have to do is search the ground
whenever Cupil starts to go a little crazy,
right? Let's see if we can find anything here.\e"
M99990009,"\h(《Fina》)Actually, the more you feed Cupil,
the stronger he will become.\e"
M99990010,"\h(《Fina》)He'll be able to change into different shapes
and inflict more damage on enemies in battle
as he grows.\c"
M99990010,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh, come right in.
This is a weapon and armor shop.\e"
M99990010,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Sorry, but I'm going to have to charge you even
if you are a fellow Air Pirate. I have to go to
a lot of trouble to get my stock.\e"
M99990010,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh, hello, Vyse! Do come in!
See anything that you want to buy?\e"
