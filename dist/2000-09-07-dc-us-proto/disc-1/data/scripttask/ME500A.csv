MAC000000,"\h(《Would you like to try again?》)“I never give up!”
“I quit.”\c"
MA5000000,"\h(《Baltor》)Gahahahaha!
How do you like that! Feel the power of
my ship, the Blackbeard!\e"
MA5000001,"\h(《Baltor》)Now, I shall teach you to tremble in fear before
the power of the Black Pirates!
Gahahahaha!!!\c"
MA5000002,"\h(《Drachma》)Listen up, boy!
At the top of the screen, a 3X3 grid will
appear. This is your input command screen.\e"
MA5000003,"\h(《Drachma》)Think of it as a time gauge of sorts.
Each turn is divided into three parts.\e"
MA5000004,"\h(《Drachma》)For each part of each turn, you,
Aika, or I can input one command.\c"
MA5000005,"\h(《Drachma》)Every once in a while, you will see a column
with a “C!” at the top of the grid.\e"
MA5000006,"\h(《Drachma》)During that turn, you will have a tactical
advantage over your opponent. Concentrate
all of your firepower into that round.\e"
MA5000007,"\h(《Drachma》)Also, certain turns have a different color
shown at the top.\e"
MA5000008,"\h(《Drachma》)These are the turns in which your enemy is goin'
to unleash a powerful attack. Make sure to use
your “Defend” command effectively.\c"
MA5000009,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrumph! He's good…
Vyse! Turn hard to starboard! Let's
try and maneuver behind him!\c"
MA5000010,"\h(《Aika》)… Something's not right, Cap'n. It looks like
he's preparing for something. I'm getting a bad
feeling about this…\e"
MA5000011,"\h(《Drachma》)He looks like he's goin' to try to get behind
us. Most ships have their engines in the back
and that makes them more vulnerable from behind.\e"
MA5000012,"\h(《Drachma》)But, if he tries to get behind us, in the
meantime, he'll be wide open. What do you
want to do, boy?\e"
MA5000013,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Try to get behind him instead.”
“Wait and see what he does.”\c"
MA5000014,"\h(《Vyse》)Now's our chance!
He won't be expecting us to try and maneuver
around to his backside!\c"
MA5000015,"\h(《Drachma》)Good job, boy!
His ship doesn't have any cannons in the back…
We've got a wide open shot at his engines.\c"
MA5000016,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't want to act in haste.
Let's see what he does…\c"
MA5000017,"\h(《Baltor》)Hahaha!!!
Fools! You've let me get behind you!
Now, you are mine!!\c"
MA5000018,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot! What're you doin'?!
Now that he's behind us, he's got
a wide open shot at our engines!!\c"
MA5000019,"\h(《Baltor》)That old ship's tough!!
I need to get behind it!\e"
MA5000020,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Maneuver behind the enemy.”
“Wait and see what he does.”\c"
MA5000021,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright! We managed to get behind him!
Now's our chance to attack!\c"
MA5000022,"\h(《Vyse》)Great… While I was sitting here twiddling my
thumbs he managed to get behind me! All hands,
prepare for impact!!!\c"
