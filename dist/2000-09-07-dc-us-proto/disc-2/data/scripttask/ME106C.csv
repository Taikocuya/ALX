M01060000,"\h(《Marco》)Hey… You really did it. You rescued your
friends. I can't believe it. You really are
something…\e"
M01060001,"\h(《Vyse》)Marco!
What are you doing here?\e"
M01060002,"\h(《Marco》)I told you before, right? I live here.
I know everything about these sewers.\e"
M01060003,"\h(《Marco》)This wall was built with a secret door.
I took your friends into the secret room just
behind me.\c"
M01060004,"\h(《Marco》)Your friends are waiting in the room right
behind me. Hurry up before the guards get smart
and come looking through this area.\c"
M01060005,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Alright, we managed to get out of the Coliseum,
but now what? We still have to get out of Valua.
And that's no easy task by any measure.\c"
M01060006,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Heh… It's been a while since I've had so much
fun! How often do we get to pound on Valuans in
their own country?\c"
M01060007,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)When they were moving us, they put us on some
sort of rail car. I've never seen anything like
that before in my whole life.\e"
M01060008,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)They got these metal boxes all lined up
one after the other, like some big, long
bug… That's one strange way to get places.\c"
M01060009,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)I can't believe you actually did it, Vyse!
You showed those Valuans a thing or two!
Haha… You were great!\c"
M01060010,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)You never cease to amaze me.
I never would have thought
I'd see you here.\e"
M01060011,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)But I'm glad you showed up.
We all owe you one.\c"
M01060012,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)There are no signs of anyone following us. But,
it's probably just a matter of time before they
find this place, too.\e"
M01060013,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)Now we just have to try and figure a way to get
out of Valua. Heh… Easier said than done, I
suppose. But, we've made it this far, at least…\c"
M01060014,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse! What are you doing? We need to decide on
some sort of plan here! Everyone's lives are at
stake! Don't go wandering around!\c"
M01060015,"\h(《Vyse》)… Hm? Is it just me, or is the color of
the wall here a little different from
everywhere else? It's probably nothing.\c"
M01060016,"\h(《Vyse》)This is where the secret door that led to Upper
City was, but it won't budge.\e"
M01060017,"\h(《Vyse》)Marco is probably the only person who knows how
to open it. Oh well… I guess there isn't much I
can do.\c"
M01060020,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like this ladder leads straight up into
the Coloseum…\e"
M01060021,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Break into the Coloseum!”
”Finish up some preparations first.”\c"
M01060018,"\h(《Vyse》)The Coloseum is in a state of confusion right
now. We really need to get everyone out of here
while we have the chance.\c"
M01060019,"\h(《Vyse》)The Coloseum is probably crawling with guards.
I'd rather not get caught right now, so it's
probably better not to climb up the ladder.\c"
MC0070000,"\h(《Dyne》)You were a little late, Vyse…
If you were any later, I'd be a whole head 
shorter right now.\e"
MC0070001,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, I always knew you were tough, but breaking
into a public execution and freeing all of us…
Now, I think you're crazy too!\e"
MC0070002,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh heh… what can I say? I'm not ready to take
over as head of the Dyne Family just yet.\e"
MC0070003,"\h(《Vyse》)Wait a minute…
Where's Fina?\e"
MC0070004,"\h(《Dyne》)Fina?
When they captured us from Pirate Isle, 
they took her somewhere else.\e"
MC0070005,"\h(《Dyne》)I overheard some soldiers talking about her… 
sounded like she was taken to the Valuan 
Imperial Palace.\e"
MC0070006,"\h(《Vyse》)What?!
Why was she taken to the palace?\e"
MC0070007,"\h(《Dyne》)It appears that the Empress herself wanted to 
meet Fina.\e"
MC0070008,"\h(《Dyne》)I've got a feeling that there's more to that 
girl than meets the eye. She knows something 
important enough to have Valua after her.\e"
MC0070009,\h(《Vyse》)Fina…\e
MC0070010,"\h(《Dyne》)… Vyse, what are you going to do?\e"
MC0070011,"\h(《What will you do?》)”We have to go save Fina!”
”Let's lay low for a little while…”\e"
MC0070012,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course we have to go save Fina! 
The guards are scattered…
The whole island is in chaos.\e"
MC0070013,"\h(《Dyne》)Hmm…
It'll be dangerous, but it looks like now is our
best chance to strike.\e"
MC0070014,"\h(《Vyse》)We should lay low for a little while. If we 
start combing the palace, we'll be spotted for 
sure.\e"
MC0070015,"\h(《Dyne》)You've still got lots to learn. This is Valua…
we'll be discovered sooner or later, whether or
not we remain hiding.\e"
MC0070016,"\h(《Dyne》)This may be our only chance to save Fina… right
now, the Imperial troops are more concerned 
about finding us!\e"
MC0070017,"\h(《Drachma》)I will take all of the Air Pirates back to the 
Little Jack. We'll be waitin' for you.\e"
MC0070018,"\h(《Vyse》)I know…
When the gates open, it's our only chance to 
escape.\e"
MC0070019,"\h(《Drachma》)First, you'll want to go to Upper City. You 
might be able to sneak aboard a rail car that's
on its way to the Palace.\e"
MC0070020,"\h(《Vyse》)I see… Upper City, huh?
Marco, how do I get to Upper City from here?\e"
MC0070021,"\h(《Marco》)Um…
If you go down that tunnel over there, 
you'll reach Upper City.\e"
MC0070022,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's go, Aika!
We gotta save Fina!\e"
MC0070023,"\h(《Drachma》)You need to be at the Little Jack when they open
the gates!\e"
MC0070024,"\h(《Marco》)But there are tons of guards in Upper City! 
You shouldn't go! It's too dangerous!\e"
MC0070025,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm ready for anything, Marco. In the midst of
the storm, I can see the one path that will get
us out of Valua. I've got to try.\e"
MC0070026,\h(　)Drachma has left the party.\e
MC0070027,"\h(《Dyne》)Here, take this with you, Vyse. It's a little
early to be giving this to you, but considering
the circumstances, I'll make an exception.\e"
MC0070028,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow! It's your Yellow Moon Stone! Thanks, Dad!\e"
MC0070029,"\h(《Dyne》)If you use it with your weapons, they'll take on
the properties of lightning.\e"
MC0070030,\h(　)You received the ”Yellow Moon Stone” from Dyne.\e
