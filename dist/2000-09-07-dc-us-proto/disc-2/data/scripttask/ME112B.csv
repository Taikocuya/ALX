ME0160000,"\h(《Aika》)Now I know why they call this place The City of
Mist. But I don't remember seeing any mist in
the forest.\e"
ME0160001,"\h(《Vyse》)The air is thin… It's a little hard to breathe.
We were going up for a long time. 
I think these mists are actually clouds.\e"
ME0160002,"\h(《Vyse》)But this doesn't look anything like a Lost City
of Gold… There's just a bunch of ruins up here.\e"
ME0160003,"\h(《Fina》)In the Old World, Rixis was the capital 
of the Green Civilization.\e"
ME0160004,\h(《Fina》)It was destroyed by the Rains of Destruction.\e
ME0160005,"\h(《Fina》)Since then, it's been frozen in time.\e"
ME0160006,"\h(《Vyse》)These craters must have been caused by the Moon
Stones that were bombarding the city.\e"
ME0160007,\h(《Aika》)I'm not seeing any gold here…\e
ME0160008,"\h(《Drachma》)As time passed, stories about this city probably
got more and more exaggerated.\e"
ME0160009,"\h(《Aika》)We were supposed to find gold here…
I should have slapped that dirty old man
silly when I had the chance.\e"
ME0160010,\h(《Aika》)What the…?\e
ME0160011,\h(《Aika》)……\e
ME0160012,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse…
If this city has been dead for generations, 
then who is that!?\e"
ME0160013,"\h(《Vyse》)What?!
Where?!\e"
ME0160014,\h(《Aika》)Over there!\e
ME0160015,"\h(《Vyse》)… Where?
I don't see anything.\e"
ME0160016,"\h(《Aika》)… Huh?
But… but… there was someone there!\e"
ME0160017,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika, this city has been dead for a very long
time… Who else would be here? It's probably
just your imagination acting up.\e"
ME0160018,"\h(《Aika》)Why don't you believe me?
I know I saw something.\e"
ME0160019,"\h(《Aika》)Fina…
Do you think that maybe I saw a ghost?\e"
ME0160020,"\h(《Fina》)A ghost?
Umm… what's a ghost?\e"
ME0160021,"\h(《Aika》)Heh…
It's been a while since you said something
like that…\e"
ME0160022,"\h(《Aika》)A ghost is… umm, how should I explain this…
Well, it's something very scary,
that's for sure!\e"
ME0160023,"\h(《Fina》)Really? Well, if you're this scared, Aika,
this ”ghost” must be something scary indeed.\e"
ME0160024,"\h(《Aika》)The two things I hate the most right now are 
dirty old men and ghosts.\e"
ME0160025,\h(《Aika》)Vyse… let's… let's not go! We'll be cursed!\e
ME0160026,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, come on, Aika… We came all this way for the
Green Crystal and we're not about 
to go back empty-handed.\e"
ME0160027,\h(《Vyse》)You could just wait here until we get back.\e
ME0160028,"\h(《Aika》)Oh no… I'm not going to wait here all by myself
with those… things out there.\e"
ME0160029,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, alright!
I'll go with you!
I can't believe I'm doing this…\e"
M01120000,"\h(《Fina》)”We, who have come from the
Temple of the Silver Moon…”\e"
M01120001,"\h(《Fina》)”… have sealed within the forests, after the
Rains of Destruction washed away the lands,
the unsleeping giant, Grendel…”\e"
M01120002,"\h(《Fina》)”And upon his sealing, the Green Crystal was
kept within these walls…”\c"
M01120003,"\h(《Fina》)This is written in the holy language
of the Silver Temple.\e"
M01120004,"\h(《Fina》)The Silvites must have inscribed these
words when they were here.\c"
M01120005,"\h(《Vyse》)So, this Quetya person that all the Ixa'takans
keep talking about was probably a Silvite just
like Fina.\e"
M01120006,"\h(《Aika》)That would explain why everyone mistook Fina
for Quetya… whoever he or she is.\c"
M01120007,"\h(《Vyse》)There some kind of writing on the walls, but
I can't read it. I have no idea what it says…\c"
M01120008,"\h(《Vyse》)There are pictures of people wearing masks.
They're probably ancestors of the Ixa'takans.\c"
M01120009,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the pedestal where the Moon Crystal was.
There's an empty spot where it used to be.\c"
ME0150000,"\h(《Vyse》)There's an indentation just big enough
to fit a small gem…\e"
ME0150001,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Let's try putting in the Golden Man's Eye gem.”
”Let's try putting in the Great Bird's Eye gem.”
”It might be dangerous… let's not touch it.”\e"
ME0150002,"\h(《Vyse》)The Golden Man's Eye is giving off a strange
light now…\e"
ME0150003,"\h(《Vyse》)The Great Bird's Eye is set into an indentation
in the statue…\e"
ME0150004,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Switch it with the Golden Man's Eye.”
”Just take the Great Bird's Eye out.”
”Leave it as it is.”\e"
ME0150005,"\h(《Vyse》)There's an indentation just big enough
to fit a small gem…\e"
ME0150006,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Let's try putting in the Golden Man's Eye gem.”
”Let's try putting in the Great Bird's Eye gem.”
”It might be dangerous… let's not touch it.”\e"
ME0150007,"\h(《Vyse》)The Golden Man's Eye is set into an indentation
in the statue…\e"
ME0150008,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Just take the Golden Man's Eye out.”
”Switch it with the Great Bird's Eye.”
”Leave it as it is.”\e"
ME0150009,"\h(《Vyse》)The Great Bird's Eye is giving off a strange
light now…\e"
M01120010,"\h(《Vyse》)This statue…
It looks like the statues that were at the
entrance to Rixis…\c"
M01120011,"\h(《Vyse》)……!
Who's that!?\e"
M01120012,"\h(《Aika》)That's it!
That's the ghost that
I saw earlier!\c"
M01120013,"\h(《Fina》)Oh…
It's running away!\e"
M01120014,"\h(《Drachma》)Who'd be lurkin' around in a place like this?!
Don't let him get away, boy!\c"
M01120015,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)”Return to the Little Jack.”
”Stay in Rixis a little while longer.”\c"
M01120016,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)”Return to the Delphinus.”
”Stay in Rixis a little while longer.”\c"
M01120017,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Take out the Golden Man's Eye gem.”
”Leave it the way it is.”\c"
M01120018,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Take out the Great Bird's Eye gem.”
”Leave it the way it is.”\c"
