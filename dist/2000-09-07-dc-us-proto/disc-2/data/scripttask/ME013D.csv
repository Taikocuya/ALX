MF0300000,\h(《Vyse》)Our ship! It's on fire!!!\e
MF0300001,"\h(《Ramirez》)Fina…
So, you are here.\e"
MF0300002,\h(《Ramirez》)I've been looking for you.\e
MF0300003,\h(《Fina》)Ramirez…\e
MF0300004,"\h(《Aika》)Fina, you know him?!\e"
MF0300005,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MF0300006,\h(《Vyse》)Did you lead this attack?!\e
MF0300007,"\h(《Ramirez》)Yes.
From this day on, Nasr belongs to the Valuan 
Empire.\e"
MF0300008,"\h(《Ramirez》)And…
I will be taking you back to Valua.\e"
MF0300009,\h(《Ramirez》)Surrender or you all die.\e
MF0300010,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse!
Please do as he says!\e"
MF0300011,\h(《Vyse》)Fina?!\e
MF0300012,"\h(《Fina》)Please… you won't be able to defeat him! 
Not yet! Do as he says…\e"
MF0300013,"\h(《What will you do?!》)”Surrender.”
”Fight… even though you know it is futile.”\e"
MF0300014,"\h(《Vyse》)Grr…
Alright… we surrender.\e"
MF0300015,\h(《Ramirez》)A wise choice.\e
MF0300016,"\h(《Ramirez》)Capture the Air Pirates.
Take them back to the Grand Fortress.\e"
MF0300017,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez…
Why are you doing this?\e"
MF0300018,\h(《Ramirez》)……\e
MF0300019,"\h(《Vyse》)We'll never surrender!
We'd rather die!\e"
MF0300020,\h(《Ramirez》)As you wish.\e
MF0300021,"\h(《Ramirez》)I would have spared you, but you leave me no 
choice.\e"
MF0310000,\h(《Gilder》)No… how…\e
MF0310001,\h(《Aika》)Vyse…\e
MF0310002,\h(《Vyse》)Can't… fight… any… longer…\e
MF0310003,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez…
Why…\e"
MF0310004,\h(《Ramirez》)……\e
M06000003,"\h(《Sailor》)I came intending to replenish my supplies in
Nasrad, but the place has burned to the ground!
What a shock!\e"
M06000004,"\h(《Sailor》)There's almost nothing being sold in the shops,
and even what's available is so expensive. But I
still have to replenish my supplies somehow... \e"
M06000005,"\h(《Sailor》)Let's see, I've bought the Moon Stones I need,
so now I have to find 5 barrels of drinking
water...   \e"
M06000006,"\h(《Sailor》)The shops are finally starting to fill up again.
Looks like I can start using Nasrad as a regular
resupply point again. \e"
M06010004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Let us see... A box of tomatoes with one, two...
No, this box is not any good either.\e"
M06010005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)When only this many survive the fire, you cannot
miscount even if you want to.\c"
M06010006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Ixa'takan cypress… Let us see, we have two, 
four… \e"
M06010007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Do not talk to me now!
I am busy with the relief supplies.\c"
M06330011,"\h(《Khazim》)Arghh!!… Crap! Dammit all! They called me the 
best gunner around! I was Khazim, the crack 
shot!\e"
M06330012,"\h(《Khazim》)But I let down my guard, and before I could do 
anything to stop them, the enemy turned the 
whole city to dust. \e"
M06330013,"\h(《Khazim》)It really chaps my hide! I think I will fly 
right over to Valua and give them a blast in the
chops!\e"
M06330014,"\h(《Vyse》)Calm down, calm down. You do anything like that,
and you'll get blasted right back. It's way too
reckless.\e"
M06330015,"\h(《Aika》)Ha, ha. So says the man who was so reckless as
to escape from Valua twice over.\e"
M06330016,"\h(《Khazim》)Wh, what is that? Y, you are not… ?\e"
M06330017,"\h(《Khazim》)Could you be that pirate Vyse who abducted the
Valuan prince and blasted your way out of the
Grand Fortress?\e"
M06330018,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I don't know about the abducted part, but 
otherwise, yes, I am indeed Vyse. \e"
M06330019,"\h(《Khazim》)In that case, you've got to do this for me,
Vyse! Let me join your crew!  \e"
M06330020,"\h(《Khazim》)I will never be satisfied until I have delivered
a blow from my cannon to Valua!\e"
M06330021,"\h(《Khazim》)I must join forces with you and become the your 
ship's gunner. Good! It is decided!\e"
M06330022,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, well, it doesn't sound like you'll take no
for an answer, so I suppose we might as well
have you come aboard.\e"
M06330023,\h(　)Khazim has joined your crew as a ”Gunner.”\c
M06340002,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)Our job was to defend Nasrad, but we were
completely helpless to do anything.\e"
M06340003,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)It makes me damn angry, and I'd sure like to go 
beat Valua to a pulp!\c"
M06350002,\h(《Khazim's Man》)Boss Khazim is in the turret on top of the wall!\e
M06350003,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)Boss says he's going to attack Valua and get
revenge even if he has to do it all by himself.\e"
Ms013d000,"\h(《ヴァイス》)アルマダの砲撃の跡だ……
あの砲撃でどれだけの人が
犠牲になったんだろう……\c"
Ms013d001,"\h(《ヴァイス》)積荷もほとんど焼け焦げている。
この街の商人は大損害だな。\c"
Ms013d002,"\h(《ヴァイス》)まだ物資は十分ではないみたい
だけど、少しずつ人も戻ってきて
復興も進んでるようだな。\c"
Ms013d003,"\h(《ヴァイス》)積荷はみんな
ドロだらけだったり焦げてたり
売り物になりそうにない。\c"
Ms013d004,"\h(《ヴァイス》)まだ物資は十分ではないみたい
だけど、少しずつ人も戻ってきて
復興も進んでるようだな。\c"
Ms013d005,"\h(《ヴァイス》)あれ……？　以前はもっと
はしけが続いてたのに。
砲撃で崩れ落ちてしまったのか。\c"
Ms013d006,"\h(《ヴァイス》)台車も焦げてボロボロだ。
でもこんなのでも今は
無いよりマシなんだろうな。\c"
Ms013d007,"\h(《ヴァイス》)城壁が崩れている……
武器弾薬が積んであったから
真っ先に砲撃されたのかもな。\c"
Ms013d008,"\h(《ヴァイス》)あれだけの大艦隊が相手じゃあ
大砲一つでは
どうにもならないよな……\c"
Ms013d009,"\h(《ヴァイス》)砲台への攻撃は
すごかったようだな……
みんなボロボロになっている。\c"
Ms013d010,"\h(《さてと……》)「デルフィナスへ帰艦しよう」
「もう少し街をうろつこう」\c"
