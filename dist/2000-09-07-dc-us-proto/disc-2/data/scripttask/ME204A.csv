MD0130000,"\h(《Belleza》)You may have won the battle, but you are far
from winning the war. There are 5 Crystals left.\e"
MD0130001,"\h(《Belleza》)The Valuan Armada never makes the same mistake
twice. You shall not defeat us again.\e"
MD0130002,"\h(《Vyse》)And we won't make the same mistake of
underestimating you again either. 
We'll get those Crystals.\e"
MD0130003,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, where should we go next?\e"
MD0130004,"\h(《Fina》)Southwest of Nasr, beyond the South Ocean…\e"
MD0130005,\h(《Fina》)There is a continent under the Green Moon.\e
MD0130006,"\h(《Vyse》)Really?!
There's a continent on the other side of the
South Ocean?!\e"
MD0130007,"\h(《Fina》)Yes.
The Green Crystal should be there.\e"
MD0130008,"\h(《Belleza》)Ha, that's the continent of Ixa'taka. 
Our soldiers are already there.\e"
MD0130009,"\h(《Belleza》)Besides, the South Ocean has a strong headwind.
You'll never make it across with that tiny ship
of yours.\e"
MD0130010,\h(《Drachma》)No need to worry about that.\e
MD0130011,"\h(《Drachma》)We're takin' your ship's engine.
With that much power, we can get across South
Ocean in no time.\e"
MD0130012,"\h(《Belleza》)What?!
Then how am I going to get back?!\e"
MD0130013,"\h(《Aika》)We all decided that you should go back on foot.
You trick us… we take your engine…
I think we're even now.\e"
MD0130014,"\h(《Aika》)What was that saying?
”Only those who have walked through the desert
can truly know its size.”\e"
MD0130015,\h(《Belleza》)You want me to… walk?\e
MD0130016,"\h(《Belleza》)… Heh.
Well… I guess I don't have much of a choice.\e"
MD0130017,"\h(《Belleza》)I never actually thought I would truly know
the size of the desert…\e"
MD0130018,"\h(《Belleza》)You win this time.
But, Valua is more powerful than you can
imagine.\e"
MD0130019,"\h(《Belleza》)And the trip to Ixa'taka is long and perilous…
The chance that you'll survive long enough to
get there is pretty slim.\e"
MD0130020,"\h(《Belleza》)Are you sure you still want to go?
You still have time to reconsider.\e"
MD0130021,\h(《Vyse》)Real sailors aren't afraid of the unknown.\e
MD0130022,\h(《Vyse》)I want to see the world…\e
MD0130023,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm not going to rest until I've left my mark on
it, and I won't let anything or anyone stand
in my way.\e"
MD0130024,"\h(《Belleza》)… I understand… You're rash and impulsive…
I hope you survive long enough for us to meet
again.\e"
MD0130025,"\h(《Belleza》)Hey, handsome…\e"
MD0130026,\h(　)You received the ”Red Moon Crystal.”\e
