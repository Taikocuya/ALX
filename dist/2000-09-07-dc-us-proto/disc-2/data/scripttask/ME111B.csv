M01110000,"\h(《Vyse》)A Valuan soldier…
I guess this is the Valuan stronghold.\c"
M01110001,"\h(《Vyse》)An Ixa'takan…
Valuans are probably forcing them to
mine for Moon Stones…\c"
M01110002,"\h(《Vyse》)This door has been welded shut…
It looks like they're serious about
keeping the Ixa'takans in here.\e"
M01110003,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, guys, but just hang in a little while
longer. I'll free all of you… I promise. I'll
send those Valuans back to Valua…\c"
M01110004,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn… This door's welded shut… It doesn't look
like I'm going to get any further this way.\c"
M01110005,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn this shutter…
It won't budge at all.\c"
M01110006,"\h(《Vyse》)There's a big shutter…
But, it doesn't look like it going to open.\c"
M01110007,"\h(《Vyse》)The door closed again. This is just great.
Why do I get the strange feeling that someone's
leading me somewhere…?\c"
M01110008,"\h(　)Perfect devices and perfect machines
are far more sacred than human life!
                            De Loco\c"
M01110009,"\h(　)Only perfect devices are worth anything!
Imperfect devices are garbage!
                             De Loco\c"
M01110010,"\h(　)Useless machines should be thrown away.
Useless people should be executed!
                               De Loco\c"
M01110011,"\h(　)Kill any Ixa'takan who tries
to resist!
                     De Loco\c"
M01110012,"\h(　)A Moon Stone pebble is worth
a gallon of blood!
                      De Loco\c"
M01110013,"\h(　)Treat my machines with respect,
or you'll be drawn and quartered!
                         De Loco\c"
M01110014,"\h(　)Inside this mine,
I am the law!
           De Loco\c"
M01110015,"\h(《Vyse》)Why do all these doors keep closing on me?
What's going on here?\c"
M01110016,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmph. Nope, it won't move.
It looks like the electricity's been cut.\c"
M01110017,"\h(《Captured Man》)Hm? You don't look like you're a Valuan…
Who might you be?\e"
M01110018,"\h(《Vyse》)It closed again…
It almost seems like someone's watching
what we do, and closing the doors…\c"
M01110019,"\h(《Vyse》)Nope… it won't open.
Looks like it's locked.\c"
M01110020,"\h(《Alfonso》)Uh… ugh…
W… Why do these things always happen to me?\c"
M01110021,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Return to the Little Jack.”
”Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01110022,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Return to the Delphinus.”
”Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01110023,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)I haven't seen you around here before.
Were you brought here recently?\e"
M01110024,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)A man named De Loco made this mine.
It's filled with nasty traps.\e"
M01110025,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)There's trap doors all over the place.
And remember, a circle doesn't always mean
it's the right way.\e"
M01110026,"\h(《Ixa'takan Slave》)If you can see below,
look down. If there's a mining cart,
it'll come back here.\c"
