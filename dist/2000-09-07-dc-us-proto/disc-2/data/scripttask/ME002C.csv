M00010000,"\h(《Jimmy》)Vyse, we took care of the island real good
while you were gone!\e"
M00010001,"\h(《Jimmy》)Aren't you proud of us? We did all this almost
almost by ourselves!\c"
M00010002,"\h(《Jimmy》)From now on, we're gonna help protect Pirate
Isle, too!\c"
M00010003,"\h(《Boy》)I'm so jealous of you, Vyse… I can't wait 'til
my dad let's me go sailing, too!\c"
M00010004,"\h(《Jimmy》)Hey, Vyse! Guess what? Guess what?
They let me on the Albatross the other day!\e"
M00010005,"\h(《Jimmy》)Well, actually, I was just helping my dad
move some boxes… hehe.\e"
M00010006,"\h(《Jimmy》)But, you gotta learn the little things like that
before you can become a sailor, right? I'm gonna
be the best sailor in the whole wide world!!\c"
M00010007,"\h(《Jimmy》)Is it really true that you sailed all the way
around the world, Vyse? It is?! Wow!!!\e"
M00010008,"\h(《Jimmy》)I'm gonna sail around the world, too, someday!
You just watch! I'm gonna be just like you
when I grow up!!\c"
M00010009,"\h(《Jimmy》)Wh, where'd that island come from?!
Where'd Shrine Island go?!
Vyse, what's going on?!\c"
M00010010,"\h(《Jimmy》)Actually, I wanted to go with you on your
journey, but my dad told me that I was too
young to be able to go out on my own yet.\e"
M00010011,"\h(《Jimmy》)So, I'll cheering for you guys from here, okay?
You better not let those bad guys beat you!!\c"
M00020000,"\h(《Alan》)While you were gone, I fixed a bunch of stuff
here on the island!\e"
M00020001,"\h(《Alan》)Heh… Now I feel like I can do anything!
Well… almost anything. Your mom helped
me move some boxes and stuff…\c"
M00020002,"\h(《Alan》)You know what? I actually had fun rebuilding
everything! It felt sorta good to make
something with my own hands!\e"
M00020003,"\h(《Alan》)Maybe I'll be a carpenter when I grow up!
I'm still a little young… but I guess it can't
hurt to dream, right Vyse!\c"
M00020004,"\h(《Alan》)Right now, all the grown-ups
are busy rebuilding the Albatross.\e"
M00020005,"\h(《Alan》)And you know what? I did such a good job helping
everyone rebuild the town that they're letting
me help rebuild the ship, too!\c"
M00020006,\h(《Alan》)Hey Vyse! Long time no see!\e
M00020007,"\h(《Alan》)You should come home more often! I want to hear
all about your adventures and stuff! I bet
you've seen some really neat stuff!\c"
M00020008,"\h(《Alan》)Really? There's a country called Yafutoma where
the houses are built right on the water?\e"
M00020009,"\h(《Alan》)Wow… I'd really like to try building something
like that! Of course… there isn't a whole lot
of water around here…\c"
M00020010,"\h(《Alan》)Vyse! There was this big roaring sound and that
island came up from inside the clouds and I was
so scared and I didn't know what to do!\c"
M00020011,"\h(《Alan》)Everybody's gone right now. They all sailed off
in the Albatross. But, I'm not scared anymore!\e"
M00020012,"\h(《Alan》)We'll be okay! We're going to defend the island
while all the grown-ups are off fighting! Just
leave everything to us, okay?\c"
M00030000,\h(《Lindsi》)Vyse! You kept your promise!! You're home!!\e
M00030001,"\h(《Lindsi》)I missed you so much! Thank… thank you for not
breaking your promise…\c"
M00030002,"\h(《Lindsi》)Welcome home, Vyse! You should come back and
visit us more often, okay? We miss you!\c"
M00030003,"\h(《Lindsi》)Wow… That's a really nice ship, Vyse!
Where'd you get that thing from? You better
let me ride in it someday!\c"
M00030004,"\h(《Lindsi》)Alright, Pow… You better take good
care of Vyse, okay?\c"
M00030005,"\h(《Lindsi》)Really?! You sailed all the way
around the world?!\e"
M00030006,"\h(《Lindsi》)But, my mommy told me that there are scary
monsters at the edge fo the world! Did any
of them try to hurt you?\c"
M00030007,"\h(《Lindsi》)Vyse… Jimmy told me that there are bad people
on that island… Is that true?\e"
M00030008,"\h(《Lindsi》)Whenever I think about that island at night…
I… I get scared and I can't go to sleep…\c"
M00030009,"\h(《Lindsi》)You better not let them beat you, Vyse! You
can't let the bad guys win!!\e"
M00030010,"\h(《Lindsi》)You better promise that you'll come home
safely, okay? Promise!!\c"
M00040000,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow!\e
M00040001,"\h(《Vyse》)How are you doing there, little guy! You seem
happy enough to see us… Hehe… Have you been
taking care of everyone while I've been gone?\e"
M00040002,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow pow!!\c
M00040003,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow!\c
M00040004,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow!\c
M00040005,"\h(《Jimmy》)Umm… Vyse, we wanted to ask you to do
something for us…\e"
M00040006,"\h(《Jimmy》)We really wish we could go with you and help
out… but we're still too young, I guess. Well,
that's what our parents say…\e"
M00040007,"\h(《Jimmy》)So, instead, we want you to take Pow with you.
He'll help you out instead!\e"
M00040008,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow!\c
M00040009,"\h(《Alan》)Pow has always been there for us… Whenever we
needed someone to cheer us up, he was there.\e"
M00040010,"\h(《Alan》)And we were just thinking that maybe if Pow
could go with you, he could cheer you up
whenever you needed it, you know?\e"
M00040011,"\h(《Vyse》)Haha… I see.
Well, then… Pow, looks like you're the newest
member of my crew!\e"
M00040012,"\h(《Lindsi》)You hear that, Pow? Vyse is going to take you
with him! You're going to get to sail on that
big ship with his crew!\e"
M00040013,\h(《Pow》)Pow! Pow pow!!\c
M00040014,"\h(　)Pow has joined your crew as an “Entertainer.”
… of sorts.\c"
M00050000,"\h(《Martha》)Vyse… I just wanted to thank you for bringing
my husband home. I know that lazy bum couldn't
have saved himself even if he tried.\e"
M00050001,"\h(《Martha》)He may be a lazy bum… but… I still love him.
I realized that when he was gone. I missed him
so much… But you better not tell him that!!\c"
M00050002,"\h(《Martha》)Can you believe it?! That good-for-nothing
husband of mine is so ungrateful! Do you know
what he told me?!\e"
M00050003,"\h(《Martha》)“The women that I saw in Valua were some of the
most beautiful women I've ever seen…”
THAT'S what he said!!!\e"
M00050004,"\h(《Martha》)Here I was, worried sick about him… And all he
could do was admire the “beautiful women” in
Valua?! I can't believe him!!\c"
M00050005,"\h(《Martha》)Can you believe it?! That good-for-nothing
husband of mine is so ungrateful! Do you know
what he told me?!\e"
M00050006,"\h(《Martha》)“The whole time I was in Valua, I couldn't stop
thinking about sailing… I wanted to be out in
the sky. Oh, and I… uh… missed you, too…”\e"
M00050007,"\h(《Martha》)Can you believe him?! “Oh, and I… uh… missed
you, too…” Here I was, worried to death, and
all he could think about was sailing!!\c"
M00050008,"\h(《Martha》)Can you believe it?! That good-for-nothing
husband of mine is so ungrateful! Do you know
what he told me?!\e"
M00050009,"\h(《Martha》)“I really feel at home when I'm out sailing.
It's so relaxing… I have so much freedom…
Oh, but I don't mean anything by that…”\e"
M00050010,"\h(《Martha》)Can you believe him?! How could he NOT mean
anything by that?! I swear, I should lock him
inside the house from now on…\c"
M00050011,"\h(《Martha》)Can you believe it?! That good-for-nothing
husband of mine is so ungrateful! Do you know
what he told me?!\e"
M00050012,"\h(《Woman》)“My goal in life is to sail around the world
like Vyse and meet all kinds of beautiful women.
Oh, I mean, I think you're beautiful, too.”\e"
M00050013,"\h(《Martha》)Can you believe that he actually said that to
me?! I swear… one more comment like that, and
he's never going sailing again!!\c"
M00050014,"\h(《Martha》)Do you know what that good-for-nothing husband
of mine just told me? He looked off in the
distance at that new island and said…\e"
M00050015,"\h(《Martha》)“Don't worry, Martha. Even if it means my life,
I will protect you and the others from whatever
happens. This, I swear to you.”\e"
M00050016,"\h(《Martha》)I… I guess he really does love me. Sometimes I
really wonder, but… at times like this, I feel
more loved than anyone else in the world…\c"
M00050017,"\h(《Martha》)Do you know what that good-for-nothing husband
of mine just told me? Right before he sailed off
with the others, he turned to me and said…\e"
M00050018,"\h(《Martha》)“Don't worry… I'll be home before you know it.
And when I come back, I'm going to be a hero! So
make sure and fix a feast for my return!!”\e"
M00050019,"\h(《Martha》)I don't know… Maybe he just doesn't know how to
word things right. I guess that's just how he
shows his love.\c"
M00060000,"\h(《Barbara》)Welcome home, Vyse. I hear that you caused quite
the commotion over in Valua. Haha… Your father
must be quite proud of you.\e"
M00060001,"\h(《Barbara》)Don't tell her I told you this, but your mother
was worried sick about you while you were gone.
She was so happy that you came home safely.\c"
M00060002,"\h(《Barbara》)So how does it feel to have gone on your
first adventure? It must feel great to
be out on your own…\e"
M00060003,"\h(《Barbara》)But, I always knew that you weren't the type
to sit still for very long. I knew it was only a
matter of time before you left here.\c"
M00060004,"\h(《Barbara》)All the men have been busy with preparations
for battle ever since that strange island
appeared over by Shrine Island.\e"
M00060005,"\h(《Barbara》)I hope they know what they're doing… I get a
bad feeling every time I look at that island…\c"
M00060006,"\h(《Barbara》)Is it true? Was Valua wiped out by the Rains of
Destruction?\e"
M00060007,"\h(《Barbara》)That's horrible… I'm sure that not all Valuans
were bad people… I can't bear to think of all
the innocent lives lost…\e"
M00060008,"\h(《Barbara》)Vyse! You can't let them get away with
this! Show them that they can't mess
with the Blue Rogues!\c"
M00070000,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)You know, for a while there, I was actually
beginning to think that I'd never live to see
this place again.\e"
M00070001,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)I owe you one, Vyse. Looks like I'll be
able to go on being an Air Pirate for
a little while longer.\c"
M00070002,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Unlike in Valua, there's always such a nice
breeze blowing on Pirate Isle. Ahhh!\c"
M00070003,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Go take a look in the underground harbor.
The new Albatross II is being constructed
right now.\e"
M00070004,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)It's about 90% finished. It won't be long before
it's ready for its maiden voyage. I can't wait
to go sailing again!!\c"
M00070005,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Hey there, Vyse! I heard that you not only
managed to escape from Valua again, but you
stole one of their best ships as well?\e"
M00070006,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)That's incredible! But we've got a new ship,
too! We just finished the last preparations
on the Albatross II!\e"
M00070007,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)We've been working on it for a long time in the
underground port, and it's finally finished! I
can't wait to take her sailing!!\c"
M00070008,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Hey there, Vyse! How've you been? The new
Albatross flies like the wind… hehe.\e"
M00070009,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)What?! You sailed around the world?! Y, you mean
that the world isn't flat?! Man… You really are
something, Vyse. I'm impressed…\c"
M00080000,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Oh! You're home! Did you want to rest for a
little while?\c"
M00080001,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Sure, I could use a little rest.”
“Nah… I'll be fine. I'm not that tired.”\e"
M00080002,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure, I could use a little rest.\e"
M00080003,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Great! I'll prepare a nice dinner for you,
okay? Just go upstairs and relax… I let you
know when dinner's ready.\c"
M00080004,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Good morning! You just becareful out
there, okay? And make sure you bundle
up if it gets cold!\c"
M00080005,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Good morning! You just becareful out
there, okay? I pray that the Moons will
watching over you…\c"
M00080006,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, mom… but not tonight. I'll stay some
other time, okay?\e"
M00080007,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Really? Well, alright. But, just remember that
you're always welcome to stay whenever you
want, okay? Be careful out there!\c"
M00090000,"\h(《Jessica》)I owe you so much, Vyse. You actually brought
my husband home safely. I… I can't believe it.\e"
M00090001,"\h(《Jessica》)But, just between you and me, I still haven't
finished that scarf that I was knitting. I
have to hurry up and finish it up!\c"
M00090002,"\h(《Jessica》)I finally finished that scarf that I was working
on, but I didn't like the color, so I'm starting
over from scratch. \e"
M00090003,"\h(《Jessica》)I know it's really my own fault, but I'm
starting to wonder when I'm ever going to
finish the thing…\c"
M00090004,"\h(《Jessica》)Oh hey, Vyse. I finished that scarf I was
working on, finally. What am I stitching
now, you ask?\e"
M00090005,"\h(《Jessica》)Well, to tell you the truth…
I'm having a baby!!!\e"
M00090006,"\h(《Jessica》)So now I'm knitting clothes for the baby.
Oh, I can't wait to see my baby wearing the
clothes that I make!\c"
M00090007,"\h(《Jessica》)It sounded like something terrible was happening
outside! There was a big blast of wind. and then
a rumbling sound… I don't know what to do…\c"
M00090008,"\h(《Jessica》)My husband went off to join the fight. He said
it was important for him to fight for our unborn
baby… He's so sweet…\e"
M00090009,"\h(《Jessica》)So, I will stay here and pray that he will
come home safely after the the battle is won.\c"
M00100000,"\h(《Granny》)They say there are six Moons in this world:
Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, and Silver.\e"
M00100001,"\h(《Granny》)Remember to pray to each of them before you
start on your next journey. It is always best
to be in favor of all the Moons…\c"
M00100002,"\h(《Granny》)It is said that many, many years ago, there was
a great civilization that once flourished among
the clouds.\e"
M00100003,"\h(《Granny》)The people achieved wonders in technology and
had an advanced culture like no other. However,
they grew proud and spiteful of others.\e"
M00100004,"\h(《Granny》)As punishment, the Moons cast the whole
civilization down beneath the clouds into Deep
Sky, never to be seen again.\c"
M00100005,"\h(《Granny》)I… I never thought that the legend of the lost
civilization was true, but it… it appears that
I was wrong… Moons, help us…\c"
M00100006,"\h(《Granny》)It seems like yesterday that you were but a
little baby, crying in your mother's arms…\e"
M00100007,"\h(《Granny》)But now, you stand here before me, a fully grown
man. Go, Vyse… Go and fulfill your destiny. I
will be here praying for you…\c"
M00110000,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)During battle, your enemies can sometimes cause
various ailments on you and your crew. If you
want, I can teach you about these ailments…\e"
M00110001,"\h(《What would you like to learn about?》)“Ask about Sleep, Confuse, and Silence.”
“Ask about Poison, Fatigue, and Stone.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M00110002,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)If an enemy puts you to “Sleep,” you will be
unable to take any further actions until either
the effect wears off or you are hit.\e"
M00110003,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)But, the length of time you will be asleep will
vary. Sometimes you will wake up right away, and
other times it might take a while.\c"
M00110004,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)“Confuse” refers to a state where you can no
longer distinguish between friend and foe and
you strike out at the nearest target.\e"
M00110005,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)If a character with high attack power is
confused, it can be disasterous for the entire
party. You need to be especially careful, Vyse.\e"
M00110006,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)“Silence” is a very bad condition to be in. It
prevents you from being able to cast any magic
spells until you are cured of it.\e"
M00110007,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)At that point, you'll really need to watch your
health. Since you won't be able to cast any
healing spells, you'll have to use items.\e"
M00110008,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)If you or any of your party members is ever
“Poisoned,” then you'll steadily take damage
throughout the battle.\e"
M00110009,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)The longer the battle drags on, the more damage
you will take. So, if it looks like it's going
to be a long battle, you should cure yourself.\e"
M00110010,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)If one of you is ever in a state of “Fatigue,”
then you will be unable to recover any of your
Spirit Points.\e"
M00110011,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Without Spirit, it's impossible to cast magic or
other special techniques. This is probably not
something you want to happen to you.\e"
M00110012,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)And then there's “Stone.” When this happens,
your entire body is turned to stone and you
will be unable to move.\e"
M00110013,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)You'll be stuck like that for several turns. The
only other way to cure the condition is through
magic or by using certain items.\e"
M00110014,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Really? Alright, then. I guess you'll just have
to learn by experiencing them firsthand!!
Hahaha!!\e"
M00110015,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Oh yeah, one more thing. Once the battle is
over, any impairments that you were suffering
from will disappear immediately.\e"
M00110016,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)So don't bother trying to cure yourself after
the battles are done. You'll just be wasting
your time.\c"
M00110017,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)It sounds like trouble's brewing…
Heh… I've been aching for some action!
I say, “Bring it on!!”\c"
M00120000,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Hey Vyse, did you know that there are six
different colors of Magic? I could teach you
them if you want…\e"
M00120001,"\h(《What would you like to learn about?》)“Ask about Green, Red, and Purple spells.”
“Ask about Blue, Yellow, and Silver spells.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M00120002,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Green Magic uses the powers of nature to heal
the recipient's body. The “Sacri” line of spells
are all healing spells.\e"
M00120003,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)However, there is also the “Noxi” line of Green
spells that use the powers of nature to poison
your enemy.\e"
M00120004,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Red spells are fire-based spells. The “Pyri”
line of spells will consume all enemies in sight
with intense flames.\e"
M00120005,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)There is also the “Increm” line of spells that
will intensify the recipient's fighting skills,
increasing their attack power and defense.\e"
M00120006,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)I don't know too much about Purple spells, but I
understand there is a line of ice spells called
“Crystali.”\e"
M00120007,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)I've also heard rumors of a Purple spell that 
as the power to affect the mind of its target.\c"
M00120008,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)The Blue spells… well, I don't know too much
about. Rumor has it that they include spells
that slow your enemy down or put him to sleep…\e"
M00120009,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Also, I have heard that there are spells called
“Wevli” that can summon a small vortex to damage
a small group of enemies…\e"
M00120010,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)The Yellow spells are lightning spells. One
useful group of spells is “Electri.” It attacks
all enemies in a straight line.\e"
M00120011,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)There's also one called Driln that reduces
your enemy's Agile as well as all of his
other combat abilities.\e"
M00120012,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)And finally, there're the Silver spells…
Very few people have studied these spells,
so there isn't much known about them.\e"
M00120013,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)But, what I do know is that there is
supposedly a spell that can cure any
kind of physical ailment…\e"
M00120014,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)And I've heard there's a spell to revive someone
who has been knocked unconcious, as well as one
that can actually kill your enemy instantly…\c"
M00120015,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)Well, aren't we a little confident. Heh… That's
okay, though. But if you think of any questions,
don't be too proud to ask, okay?\c"
M00120016,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)I've taught you everything that I know, Vyse.
There isn't much more that you can learn from
me now.\e"
M00120017,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)You know enough to keep yourself alive out in
the skies. Use that knowledge wisely!\c"
M00190000,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)I owe everything to you guys. If it wasn't for
your bravery, none of us would have ever made
it home to Pirate Isle.\e"
M00190001,"\h(《Borris the Gunner》)I just wanted to let you know that… I'm
grateful. Your father raised you well, Vyse.\c"
M00190002,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)You can count on me to keep a sharp lookout!
I may only be a deckhand, but Ben tells me that
I'm a great lookout, too!\e"
M00190003,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)I've got a precious little wife to protect. No
way am I going to let the Valuans attack this
island again.\c"
M00190004,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)I was standing on watch like always, when
