MF0110000,\h(《Vyse》)I'm… I'm alive?\e
MF0110001,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like I've been separated from Aika and
Fina… I hope they're okay.\e"
MF0110002,\h(《Vyse》)Where am I?\e
MF0110003,"\h(　)Aika, Fina, and Drachma have left the party.\e"
MF0120000,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I guess I'm not the first guy to get 
shipwrecked on this island. From the look of 
his's clothes, he was probably a sailor too.\e"
MF0120001,\h(《Vyse》)Looks like he's been dead for a long time.\e
MF0120002,"\h(《Vyse》)There's something embroidered on his collar… 
”Gonzales.” I guess that was his name.\e"
MF0120003,"\h(《Vyse》)…Hmm?
There's something in his pocket…\e"
MF0120004,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a map!
It's a little old. Maybe it's a map of this 
island.\e"
MF0120005,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… there aren't any of the same landmarks…
It's probably a map of a different island.\e"
MF0120006,"\h(《Vyse》)It may come in handy some day.
I'll just hold onto this map for a while.\e"
MF0120007,\h(　)You got ”Gonzales' Map.”\e
MF0120008,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I'll give you a proper burial, so you'll 
finally be able to rest in peace.\e"
MF0120009,"\h(《Vyse》)… There… 
Well, I guess I should find some high ground so 
I can check out the rest of the island.\e"
MF0130000,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I'm definitely on an island…
And an uninhabited one at that.\e"
MF0130001,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… looks like a storm is coming in. 
I should find some shelter.\e"
MF0130002,"\h(《Vyse》)There was a cave next to the spot where 
I buried Gonzales. Maybe I should check it out.\e"
MF0170000,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika… Fina…
Are you looking at the same Moon right now?
I hope you're alright.\e"
MF0170001,"\h(《Vyse》)And so I spent my first night alone on the 
desert island.\e"
MF0170002,"\h(《Vyse》)I woke up to some fresh, clean air and a warm 
sun. \e"
MF0170003,"\h(《Vyse》)Ah, that felt great!
But, I'm really hungry right now…\e"
MF0170004,"\h(《Vyse》)If Gonzales survived long enough to settle into 
that cave, there's got to be food on this 
island. It's time to go hunting…\e"
MF0180000,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh man, I ate so much.
Those things actually taste pretty good.\e"
MF0180001,"\h(《Vyse》)I should have enough food to last me for a 
while.\e"
MF0180002,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder if this island is near any of the trade
routes… A ship has got to pass by here sooner
or later.\e"
MF0180003,"\h(《Vyse》)I should prepare some sort of signal fire in 
case I see any ships.\e"
MF0180004,"\h(《Vyse》)I spent my second day gathering food. 
Lucky for me that the island was inhabited by 
animals…\e"
MF0180005,"\h(《Vyse》)I started my third day with a big breakfast… 
Now it was time to get to work.\e"
MF0190000,\h(《Vyse》)… What?\e
MF0190001,\h(《Vyse》)… A ship!\e
MF0190002,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… why couldn't it have come a little
earlier? I wouldn't have spent all that time 
working on the boat!\e"
MF0190003,"\h(《Vyse》)Yes!!! They saw me!! Well, looks like I'm 
finally getting off of this rock.\e"
MF0320000,"\h(《Vyse》)I went to the highest point of the island that I
could reach and cleared away an area for a 
signal fire.\e"
MF0320001,"\h(《Vyse》)If a ship passes by, all I need to do is light 
it and they'll probably see it.\e"
MF0320002,"\h(《Vyse》)I've been stranded on this island for three 
days.\e"
MF0320003,"\h(《Vyse》)That night…
I had a dream about Aika, Fina, and even 
Drachma…\e"
MF0320004,\h(《Vyse》)On the fourth day…\e
MF0320005,"\h(《Vyse》)Ahh… this place isn't so bad…
Let's see…\e"
MF0320006,\h(《Vyse》)I need to gather some firewood…\e
MF0320007,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… they're dry and they're just about the 
right size. I should look for more sticks like 
these.\e"
MF0340000,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it's been raining all day. 
I guess I won't get much done.
I'll just rest for now.\e"
MF0340001,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't just want to sit around all day, 
hoping for a ship to pass by…\e"
MF0340002,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder if I can fix the lifeboat 
from the Little Jack?\e"
MF0340003,"\h(《Vyse》)It rained all day.
I spent most of the day resting in the cave.\e"
MF0340004,"\h(《Vyse》)This is my fifth night on this island…
First thing tomorrow, I'll try to fix 
the lifeboat!\e"
MF0340005,"\h(《Vyse》)Another good night's rest. It actually does feel
good to take a break from fighting monsters. 
Well, I better get started on fixing the boat!\e"
MF0340006,"\h(《Vyse》)Since this island has been deserted for a while,
there should be some Moon Stones lying around. 
The rain probably unearthed a bunch of them.\e"
MF0340007,"\h(《Vyse》)Here's one!
But I'll need more than one
to fly to the next island.\e"
MF0340008,\h(《Vyse》)Time to look for some more!\e
MF0360000,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright…
That should just about do it.\e"
MF0360001,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm finally going to be able to get off this 
island tomorrow!\e"
MF0370002,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika… Fina…
Wherever you are…
I hope you guys are safe…\e"
MF0370001,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it doesn't look like I have much of a 
choice, so I might as well set up camp in here 
and get some rest.\e"
MF0370000,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess my friend Gonzales had the same idea.
It looks like he was living here for quite a
while too.\e"
MG0180000,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, this is pretty amazing, huh?\e"
MG0180001,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, Enrique…
How does it feel to be outside the Imperial
Palace?\e"
MG0180002,\h(《Enrique》)Huh? Oh…\e
MG0180003,"\h(《Enrique》)Everything is so… ungh… so… beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it before.\e"
MG0180004,\h(《Aika》)Looks like someone is a little airsick.\e
MG0180005,"\h(《Aika》)Perhaps all of this traveling is a little rough 
for our sheltered Prince.\e"
MG0180006,"\h(《Enrique》)Yes… Aika… you are correct…
I… I never realized that sailing could be so… 
so… rough.\e"
MG0180007,"\h(《Enrique》)But this was my… decision…
I can't let a little airsickness…
slow me down…\e"
MG0180008,\h(《Enrique》)Ungh…!!!\e
MG0180009,"\h(《Fina》)Enrique…
Are you going to be alright?\e"
MG0180010,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it looks like this is going to be a long
trip for Enrique.\e"
MG0180011,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah, don't worry Enrique. Once you get used to
sailing, you won't get sick as easy. I'm sure
you'll be okay.\e"
MG0180012,"\h(《A gangly old man's voice》)Hey!
It took you guys long enough to get here!\e"
MG0180013,"\h(《Small Old Man》)Hey! Hey!
It's good to meet you!
You're Vyse, right?!\e"
MG0180014,"\h(《Gangly Old Man》)Gilder told us that you needed a crew. 
We're here to report for duty.\e"
MG0180015,"\h(《Brabham》)I'm Brabham!
If anything's broke, I can fix it! I'm the
greatest engineer that ever lived!\e"
MG0180016,"\h(《Brabham》)That's a nice lookin' ship! If you want, I can
get it running smoother than ever! Crank it up a
few notches… give it more power…\e"
MG0180017,"\h(《Izmael》)Ba-ba-bam! I'm Izmael. You want something built?
I build it. You don't want something built?
I build it anyway.\e"
MG0180018,"\h(《Izmael》)I'll build some buildings for you! You're going
to need a base, right? \e"
MG0180019,\h(《Vyse》)Uhh… sure… thank you.\e
MG0180020,"\h(《Brabham》)Leave it up to us!!
… But, before we get started, we'll need some
funds to cover expenses and labor.\e"
MG0180021,"\h(《Brabham》)First, I'll fortify the hull of your ship so you
will be able to pass through the stone reefs.\e"
MG0180022,"\h(《Brabham》)Then, I will upgrade your engine so… You'll be
powering through sky rifts in no time.\e"
MG0180023,"\h(《Brabham》)But it will cost you…
25,000 gold.\e"
MG0180024,"\h(《Izmael》)I plan to build you a port and some living
quarters first.\e"
MG0180025,"\h(《Izmael》)Let's see…
Cha-ching! I'll need about 75,000 gold. 
What a bargain!\e"
MG0180026,"\h(《Aika》)What?!
So all together, we'll need to give you 100,000
gold?!\e"
MG0180027,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, the Delphinus does need some
modifications, and we are going to need more
than a couple of caves to call this a base…\e"
MG0180028,"\h(《Vyse》)Enrique is right. Let's put off our search for
the other Moon Crystals until we can get 100,000
gold to pay these… umm… gentlemen.\e"
MG0190000,"\h(《Aika》)Oh! I just remembered!
We were talking about making a new flag, right?\e"
MG0190001,"\h(《Aika》)If everyone is finished, we can decide on one.\e"
MG0190002,"\h(《Enrique》)I'd forgotten all about that.
Alright, Vyse… you first.\e"
MG0190003,\h(《Vyse》)What? Me first?\e
MG0190004,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… well, I put a lot of thought into this.
Don't laugh, people…\e"
MG0190005,"\h(《Vyse》)This is what I drew.
Being Air Pirates and all, I figured we should
at least have a skull in the flag…\e"
MG0190006,"\h(《Vyse》)And since most pirates use swords, 
I figured we should have one 
of those on the flag, too.\e"
MG0190007,"\h(《Aika》)Hey!
That's pretty good!\e"
MG0190008,"\h(《Enrique》)Alright… Aika, you're next.\e"
MG0190009,"\h(《Aika》)I figured the skull thing was overdone, so I
tried to go with something quick and cunning.
That's why I drew a cat.\e"
MG0190010,"\h(《Aika》)I drew some gold to show people that we'd sneak
up on them and steal their gold before they knew
what happened.\e"
MG0190011,"\h(《Fina》)Haha…
Aika, that cat looks just like you!\e"
MG0190012,"\h(《Aika》)Well, I had to give the cat some personality. 
Do you think I got a little carried away?\e"
MG0190013,"\h(《Vyse》)Waaay too carried away. Heh heh…
Alright, Fina… it's your turn.\e"
MG0190014,"\h(《Fina》)Well… I felt that skulls were a little too
scary, so I wanted to make something happier.\e"
MG0190015,"\h(《Fina》)The word Delphinus refers to an ancient creature
that lived in the seas. I drew one of them to
show everyone what our ship was named after.\e"
MG0190016,"\h(《Aika》)There's no reason to be embarassed, Fina!
I don't think there's ever been an Air Pirate
flag that looked like this! I like it.\e"
MG0190017,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, that's all of them.\e"
MG0190018,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, you're the Captain…
Which one do you like?\e"
MG0190019,"\h(《Which one will you pick?》)”Sorry, but I like the one I made.”
”Aika's flag is good.”
”I've decided on Fina's flag.”\e"
MG0190020,"\h(《Vyse》)…I hope I don't sound too selfish saying this,
but I'd like to stick with my flag. It shows
everyone that we mean business.\e"
MG0190021,"\h(《Enrique》)I don't think there's anything wrong with that. 
It's very straightforward and it shows 
what the Blue Rogues are all about.\e"
MG0190022,"\h(《Aika》)I agree!
Then we'll use Vyse's.\e"
MG0190023,"\h(《Fina》)I'll make a big one and put it inside the
bridge!\e"
MG0190024,"\h(《Vyse》)I think Aika's flag will lift the spirits of the
crew… \e"
MG0190025,"\h(《Enrique》)Yes, I agree. I like what it stands for, and it
is pretty funny.\e"
MG0190026,\h(《Aika》)Thanks! I'm glad you like it.\e
MG0190027,\h(《Fina》)I'll make a big one and put it on the bridge.\e
MG0190028,"\h(《Vyse》)I think I like Fina's flag. It's very original
and people will remember the name of our ship.\e"
MG0190029,"\h(《Vyse》)It doesn't exactly strike fear into the hearts
of anyone, but it shows our good intentions.\e"
MG0190030,"\h(《Fina》)Oh, thank you.
I'm so glad… when I first drew it, I thought it
might be a little strange…\e"
MG0190031,"\h(《Aika》)Well then, I'll hang one up in the bridge, too!!\e"
MG0190032,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, it's getting late…
I'm starting to get hungry, too.\e"
MG0190033,"\h(《Brabham》)Hey, everyone!
Dinner is ready!\e"
MG0190034,\h(《Aika》)Great timing!\e
MG0190035,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it looks like we're spending the night at
our new headquarters… Crescent Isle.\e"
MG0200000,"\h(《アイカ》)船はパワーアップするし
この島に建物もできるし……
足元はじゅーぶん固まったね！\e"
MG0200001,"\h(《ヴァイス》)ああ。

月晶探しの航海に出発するか！\e"
MG0200002,"\h(《エンリック》)そうか……今度は
船酔いしなければいいが……\e"

MG0200005,"\h(《アイカ》)ラミレスって言ったっけ……
ファイナ、あのアルマダの提督と
知り合いなの？\e"
MG0200006,\h(《ファイナ》)えっ……\e
MG0200007,"\h(《アイカ》)ナスラードの街で、あの人に
会った時……なんだか
知り合いみたいだったから。\e"

別に言わなくていいんだよ。

かわいがってくれました。\e"
MG0200019,"\h(《ファイナ》)そんなラミレスだけに

MG0200020,"\h(《ファイナ》)数年前……
一人で、月晶を探すために
旅だっていったのです。\e"
MG0200021,"\h(《ファイナ》)しかし……それ以来
ラミレスの消息は、ぷっつりと
途絶えてしまいました。\e"
MG0200022,"\h(《ファイナ》)まさか、ギガスを

バルアにいたなんて……\e"
MG0200023,"\h(《ファイナ》)どうして……
どうして、ラミレスは
変わってしまったのでしょう。\e"
MG0200024,"\h(《ファイナ》)昔の優しかった
ラミレスは、もう……
もどってこないのでしょうか？\e"
MG0200025,"\h(《エンリック》)ラミレス提督か……

MF0330000,\h(《Vyse》)Well I have enough firewood to last me a while.\e
MF0330001,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like it's going to rain soon… 
I should call it quits for today.\e"
MF0330002,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it was my fourth day on this island and 
I'm really starting to miss sailing.\e"
MF0330003,"\h(《Vyse》)I suppose I just have to think of this as some
sort of vacation and deal with it…\e"
MF0330004,\h(《Vyse》)On the fifth day…\e
MF0350000,"\h(《Vyse》)These Moon Stones haven't been processed yet. 
They may not give off much power, but it should 
be enough to power this little lifeboat.\e"
MF0350001,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like I'll finally make it off of this 
island.\e"
MF0350002,"\h(《Vyse》)I started working on the boat.
This island is full of trees, so I won't have to
worry about running out of materials.\e"
MF0350003,"\h(《Vyse》)Eating the food that I saved up, I spent the 
next few days hard at work on the boat.\e"
MF0350004,\h(《Vyse》)One week passed…\e
M14000000,"\h(《Brabham 》)So, do you have the 25,000 gold that I need
to modify your ship?\e"
M14000001,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Give 25,000 gold to Brabham.”
”Have him take care of it later.”\e"
M14000002,"\h(　)You gave Brabham 25,000 gold.\e"
M14000003,"\h(《Brabham》)Yippee!
Now I can fortify the hull
of the Delphinus for you!\e"
M14000004,"\h(《Brabham》)You'll be going through stone reefs and 
sky rifts in no time!\e"
M14000005,"\h(《Brabham》)Heh… This will probably take all night.
But don't you worry, I'll make sure that the
ship will be ready to go by tomorrow morning!\e"
M14000006,\h(《Vyse》)I'm counting on you Brabham!\e
M14000007,"\h(《Aika》)Now we'll be able to go after the rest 
of the Moon Crystals!\c"
M14000008,"\h(《Brabham》)Huh? 
Hey, I wasn't born yesterday, you know. \e"
M14000009,"\h(《Brabham》)When you get the 25,000 gold together,
gimme a holler!\c"
M14000010,"\h(《Brabham》)I'm itchin' to get started on the hull 
for your ship. Stop by when you're ready!
\c"
M14000011,"\h(《Brabham》)Just you wait, Skipper! You'll be flyin' through
those stone reefs and sky rifts like 
they were nothin'.\c"
M14000012,"\h(《Brabham》)Hey, Captain Vyse. 
How's the Delphinus doing? That's a mighty 
fine lookin' ship if ya ask me!\c"
M14010000,"\h(《Izmael》)I'll need 75,000 gold to start building your
headquarters.\e"
M14010001,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Give 75,000 gold to Izmael.”
”Give it to him later.”\e"
M14010002,"\h(　)You gave Izmael 75,000 gold.\e"
M14010003,"\h(《Izmael》)Don't worry… This will be the best investment
