MC0240000,"\h(《Aika》)Hmm… Lower City looks worse up close.
Everything is so dirty and run down… and it
smells like… garbage.\e"
MC0240001,"\h(《Vyse》)We still need to check the place out. 
We need to find a way to save Dad and 
the others.\e"
MC0240002,"\h(《Vyse》)Captain, what do you think we should do?\e"
MC0240003,"\h(《Drachma》)I'm returnin' to the docks…
I'll be overseein' the installation of the 
Harpoon Cannon.\e"
MC0240004,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's split up. Aika and I will check out the 
city, while you get your cannon.  When we're 
done, let's meet back at the inn.\e"
MC0240005,"\h(《Drachma》)Sure.
I'll see you two later then.\e"
M02000000,"\h(《Young Boy》)Hm?
Who're you?\e"
M02000001,"\h(《Little Boy》)You guys look like sailors…
Stupid ones, at that. Why else would you come
all this way to see a dump like Lower City?\e"
M02000002,"\h(《Aika》)Well, well… aren't we a little obnoxious…
Kind of reminds me of a particular someone when
they were little.\e"
M02000003,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey! I wasn't this annoying when I was little!
Give me some credit here!\e"
M02000004,"\h(《Young Boy》)What did you say?!
Are you trying trying to start a fight with me?!\e"
M02000005,"\h(《Young Boy》)The name is Marco!
Everybody who is anybody in this town knows who
I am!\e"
M02000006,"\h(《Vyse》)Haha… For such a short kid, you sure know how
to talk big!\e"
M02000007,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, boy, but we don't have time to play with
little kids right now.\e"
M02000008,"\h(《Marco》)What did you say?!
I'll remember this! Fools!\e"
M02000009,"\h(《Marco》)You'll regret having made me angry!
I'll remember this!!\e"
M02010000,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)This is Lower City.
The people of Valua are forced to live in
certain areas, depending on their status.\e"
M02010001,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)So, this desolate place is where all of us poor
people are forced to live…\e"
M02010002,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)This happened quite a while ago, but once,
there were these Air Pirates that came here to
rescue their friends and family…\e"
M02010003,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)…And they broke them out of the Coliseum! It
was great… They were such good fighters. Well,
I guess you had to be there to understand…\c"
M02020000,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)Excuse me, but have you seen my husband?\e"
M02020001,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)He should've been home by now! I wonder where
he's wandered off to now… I hope he's okay.
I told him not to stay out too long after dark…\c"
M02020002,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)That reminds me…
I haven't seen that kid, Marco, in a while.
I wonder where he's run off to…\c"
M02030000,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)*sigh*
Those rich nobles… they're so lucky that they
get to live in Upper City on the other shore…\e"
M02030001,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)They get to eat good food…
wear nice clothes…
live in big houses…\e"
M02030002,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)Sigh…
Why did I have to be born in
this awful place?\c"
M02030003,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)Sigh…
Why was I born on this side of the bay?\c"
M02040000,"\h(《Dog-like Animal》)Parurururu…
Pow pow!\e"
M02050000,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Did you hear?
Tomorrow at noon, there's going to be an
execution at the Coliseum.\e"
M02050001,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)I heard that they will be executing some
Air Pirates that the Armada captured.\e"
M02050002,"\h(《Vyse》)Wh, what?!
Is that true?!\e"
M02050003,"\h(《Bar Owner》)Yeah. There was a soldier in here earlier
telling everyone about it. Heh… it's been a
while since we've had an interesting show.\e"
M02050004,"\h(《Vyse》)They make executions into shows?
This place is horrible…\e"
M02050005,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse…
We have no time to waste.\e"
M02050006,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)It sounds like the Air Pirates will be saying
goodbye to their heads… so sad.\c"
M02050007,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)I heard that there was a commotion of some sort
over at the Grand Fortress.\e"
M02050008,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Well, it's not like that has much to do with us
here in Lower City, so it probably doesn't
matter anyway.\c"
M02060000,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)Day after day… all I ever do is build Valuan
battleships until I can hardly stand…\e"
M02060001,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)I don't feel like doing anything anymore…
Why can't I live like the people in Upper City?
They get to play everyday… It's just not fair.\e"
M02070000,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)I'm tired…
Just leave me alone…\e"
M02080000,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Welcome to my store.
This is the weapons and armor shop.\e"
M02080001,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Buy and sell weapons and armor.”
”Talk about various things.”
”Leave.”\e"
M02080002,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)A lot of our wares are handed down from the
Valuan Armada, but I guarantee their quality.\c"
M02080003,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Thank you!
Please come again!\c"
M02090000,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Welcome. We don't have a whole lot in this city,
but will you please buy something… anything…
please…\e"
M02090001,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Buy and sell items.”
”Talk about various things.”
”Leave.”\e"
M02090002,"\h(《Item Merchant》)If you're looking for the Ship Parts Merchant,
he's been at the docks a lot recently.\e"
M02090003,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Ever since he started selling Harpoon Cannons,
the customers have been coming in droves.\c"
M02090004,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Thank you very much!
I hope you will shop here again!\c"
M02100000,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)Well, even though life here is hard… really
hard… and there aren't many pleasantries…\e"
M02100001,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)… I never want to forget how to smile.
If you forget how to smile, you'll never have
anything to look forward to again.\e"
M02110000,"\h(《Drachma》)I will be overseeing the modifications that are
being done to the Little Jack. You go on ahead
to the inn.\e"
Ms005a000,"\h(《ヴァイス》)うえっ、生ゴミのいやなニオイ。

Ms005a019,"\h(《ヴァイス》)今はコロシアムにオヤジたちを
救出しに行くのが先決だ。
バルア脱出は、その後だ。\c"
Ms005a016,"\h(《ヴァイス》)オヤジたちやファイナと
合流していない。
まだ脱出するわけにはいかない！\c"
Ms005a017,"\h(《ヴァイス》)リトルジャックが
脱出の準備をしている。俺たちも
急いでファイナを救出するぞ！\c"
