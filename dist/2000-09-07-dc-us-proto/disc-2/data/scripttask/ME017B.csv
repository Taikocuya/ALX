M01000000,"\h(《Polly》)This place isn't bad. It sort of reminds me
of my tavern back on Sailors' Island.\e"
M01000001,\h(《Polly》)I think I'll be able to cook here… \e
M01000002,"\h(《Polly》)But, the kitchen could use a little work.
It needs some remodeling if I'm going to make
some of my more popular dishes.\c"
M01000003,"\h(《Polly》)If you let me remodel the place, I'll be able 
to open a tavern here on your island.\c"
M01140000,"\h(《Pinta》)This is a really nice island! It's even in a 
great location, too! We should be able to go on 
all sorts of adventures from here.\e"
M02000000,"\h(《Marco》)I never thought that I would ever be able to get
out of Valua. And I never knew the outside world
was so big!\e"
M02000001,"\h(《Marco》)After your little pep talk, I've been wanting to
see as much of the world as I can. Thanks, Vyse!
I can't wait to go sailing again!\c"
M02000002,"\h(《Marco》)Heh… The biggest surprise for me after getting 
out of Valua was probably the sky… It's blue. 
I've never seen a blue sky before…\e"
M02000003,"\h(《Marco》)And the clouds are white! I thought they were 
all dark like the ones in Valua!\e"
M02000004,"\h(《Marco》)Hey, don't laugh! If you lived in Lower City 
your whole life, you'd understand!\c"
M02000005,"\h(《Marco》)So, how's the ship's new engine doing?\e"
M02000006,"\h(《Marco》)Heh… Who'd have thought that I'd become an
engineer… I actually helped build that thing!
I did a pretty good job if I do say so myself.\c"
M02000007,"\h(《Marco》)Welcome back, Vyse! I bet you were surprised to
find the island all fixed up, weren't you?\e"
M02000008,"\h(《Marco》)I helped Izmael a lot, too! Okay, well… I only 
painted the walls, but it was still a lot 
of work!\c"
M02000009,"\h(《Marco》)Hey, you guys saw the shooting stars that 
were falling over Valua, right?\e"
M02000010,"\h(《Marco》)Ever since that happened, you and Aika have 
been looking pretty upset. What's up? Did 
something bad happen?\c"
M02000011,"\h(《Marco》)The Armada made the Moon Stones fall on Valua,
huh?\e"
M02000012,"\h(《Marco》)I… I didn't really like the place, but… I grew
up there. It makes me sad that it's all gone.\e"
M02000013,"\h(《Marco》)Vyse, promise me that we'll beat the Armada. 
We can't let them get away with what they've
done.\c"
M02000014,"\h(《Marco》)We have to stop them before they destroy all 
of the other lands. There's so much I haven't
seen yet.\c"
M04090000,"\h(《Kalifa》)Welcome. Heed my words and the future will be
known…\e"
M04090001,"\h(《Will you have your fortune told?》)”Pay 10 gold for your fortune.”
”Maybe some other time.”\e"
M04090002,\h(　)You gave 10 gold to Kalifa.\e
M04090003,"\h(《Kalifa》)Very well.
Let us begin.\e"
M04090004,\h(《Kalifa》)Hmmm…\e
M04090005,\h(《Kalifa》)Haaaa!!!\e
M04090006,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Remember to chew 
your food well before swallowing!\e"
M04090007,"\h(《Kalifa》)That way you won't choke on it, and it
also aids the digestion process.\c "
M04090008,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Having a low
”Swashbuckler Rating” will affect your mission!\e"
M04090009,"\h(《Kalifa》)When you have a low rating, it will become
easier to run from fights and easier to avoid
them all together!\c"
M04090010,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Hmm… it looks like
tomorrow will be partly cloudy and there is
chance of rain in some areas.\e"
M04090011,"\h(《Kalifa》)So, if you have any laundry out to dry, you
better bring it inside today!\c"
M04090012,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Having a high
”Swashbuckler Rating” will affect the morale
of your crew in a positive manner.\e"
M04090013,"\h(《Kalifa》)Your courage will inspire them, and they will 
fight harder! You will be more successful 
in battle!\c"
M04090014,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! On… Pirate Isle…
the little girl named Lindsi… Oh, no! She will
be playing on the dock and… and…\e"
M04090015,"\h(《Kalifa》)… and she's going to get a splinter
in her finger!\c"
M04090016,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! A woman from a tavern
and a man who sits alone in silence will be
reunited!\e"
M04090017,"\h(《Kalifa》)And they will live happily ever after once 
they are together again as husband and wife. 
Such a happy ending…\c"
M04090018,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! 
Your lucky number is 4. 
Your lucky color is… umm… blue.\e"
M04090019,"\h(《Kalifa》)Couples should spend more time outdoors!
Fresh air and beautiful scenery can be 
invigorating…\c"
M04090020,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! On Sailors' Island,
there are some rare items for sale.\e"
M04090021,"\h(《Kalifa》)So, be sure to check back there as often as
possible to see what new wares are in the
merchants' possession!\c"
M04090022,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! You will meet many
people during your travels. You will also part
with many people…\e"
M04090023,"\h(《Kalifa》)…What? You say that could be anyone's fortune?!
Skeptic! You must learn to accept your own fate.
Then you will learn your true purpose.\c"
M04090024,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! In this world, there
are 3 special Chams called ”Abirik Chams.”\e"
M04090025,"\h(《Kalifa》)You never know where you'll get them from, so
make sure to be nice to people… they may
surprise you with a gift.\c"
M04090026,"\h(《Kalifa》)Defensive techniques only last for one round,
but their effect is guaranteed.\e"
M04090027,"\h(《Kalifa》)So, if you can anticipate your enemies' moves,
you will be able to render their attacks
ineffective.\c"
M04090028,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Once you are the
captain of your own ship and your Spirits
are as high as they can be…\e"
M04090029,"\h(《Kalifa》)You will gain the power to call forth all of
your allies to battle by your side.\c"
M04090030,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Your crew will react
differently depending on the condition of your
ship.\e"
M04090031,"\h(《Kalifa》)Once you have a crew, talk to them often.
Especially when all seems lost.\c"
M04090032,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! If you want to
make your cannons more effective, seek out
a ”Gunner” for your crew.\e"
M04090033,"\h(《Kalifa》)On the other hand, if you wish to increase the
defensive power of your ship, then you should
find an ”Engineer” to help maintain it.\c"
M04090034,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Princess Moegi will 
find love. But that love will cause her great
pain.\e"
M04090035,"\h(《Kalifa》)I… I cannot see more. The future hangs in the
balance. You must be strong, for you carry the
the fate of the world on your shoulders.\c"
M04090036,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! If you always stand
your ground in a fight, word will spread
amongst the people of your bravery.\e"
M04090037,"\h(《Kalifa》)On the other hand, if you always flee from your
adversaries, the people will learn of your
cowardice. Be careful in your actions.\c"
M04090038,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! When a Moon Stone 
becomes contaminated, it becomes a ”Chom.”
They have the opposite effect as ”Chams.”\e"
M04090039,"\h(《Kalifa》)Giving Cupil a Chom will result in him
regurgitating all of the Chams that he has eaten
up until that point. Use them wisely.\c"
M04090040,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! Tonight, you must
avoid eating fish at all costs!\e"
M04090041,"\h(《Kalifa》)If you do, it will upset your stomach and you
will feel a sickness many times worse than that
caused by air travel.\c"
M04090042,\h(《Kalifa》)… Nothing. I see nothing.\e
M04090043,"\h(《Kalifa》)Well, just consider the gold that you spent as
an investment in your future.\c"
M04090044,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something! 
You will travel by air to a faraway land!\e"
M04090045,"\h(《Kalifa》)Oh, sorry. You already did that, didn't you?\c"
M04090046,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!\e"
M04090047,"\h(《Kalifa》)Ancient wisdom will fall because of 
what a young heart feels.\c"
M04090048,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!
I see great danger in your immediate future!\e"
M04090049,"\h(《Kalifa》)A great evil takes many shapes, 
but in reality… it has none.
That is all I can say, for now.\c"
M04090050,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!
But it is cloudy… Perhaps another 10 gold 
tomorrow will clear things up!\e"
M04090051,"\h(《Kalifa》)Hey, fortune tellers have to eat too, you know.
\c"
M04090052,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!
I see a Moon Stone! But, its color is…\e"
M04090053,"\h(《Kalifa》)Hard to see. It's not red. Nor is it purple, 
blue, or green. Nor is it yellow, or silver. 
It's a color that I've never seen.\c"
M04090054,"\h(《Kalifa》)Yes, yes! I see something!\e"
M04090055,"\h(《Kalifa》)There is more to Deep Sky than meets the eye!
Use caution Vyse, there is great evil under the
clouds.\c"
M04090066,"\h(《Kalifa》)The Red Moon has spoken. Remember it always and 
the way will be clear to you.\e"
M04090067,"\h(《Kalifa》)I'm very sorry, but you don't have enough gold. 
Come back again later.\c"
M04090068,"\h(《Kalifa》)I see… very well. If you ever need the guidance
of the Red Moon, do not hesitate to return.\c"
M04090069,"\h(《Kalifa》)Remember my words and heed them carefully.
Now go forth and fulfill your destiny.\e"
M04090070,"\h(《Kalifa》)By the way, can you do something with this tent?
It's awfully hard to concentrate in such… 
austere surroundings.\c"
M05030000,"\h(《Merida》)I have heard that the royal family of Valua is 
cruel, and the people of Valua are cold-hearted.\e  "
M05030001,"\h(《Merida》)But Enrique is so nice. Marco is cute, too. I 
think that it is wrong to judge people just 
because they come from somewhere else.\c"
M05100000,"\h(《Hans》)I'm learning all about shipbuilding from Brabham
right now.\e"
M05100001,"\h(《Hans》)Brabham is an expert on all kinds of engines, 
from old models to new models, so I've learned
a lot from him! My father would be proud!\e"
M05100002,"\h(《Hans》)He let me read the Yafutoman Book 
on Ship Polarity.\e"
M05100003,"\h(《Hans》)From that, I learned how to build an engine 
using wave motion technology and how to arrange
the sails when flying at extreme heights!\c"
M05100004,"\h(《Hans》)The Great Cloud Sea Engine was quite a job. And 
Brabham is so strict when it comes to work.\e"
M05100005,"\h(《Hans》)He must be tired from all those sleepless 
nights, but he doesn't show it.  He is so 
energetic, especially for his age!\e"
M05100006,"\h(《Hans》)Well, our base is as good as ever.
Now, we just have to prepare for the
assault on Valua.\e"
M05100007,"\h(《Hans》)Did you notice, during the attack, how fast some
of their ships were? Or even that one ship that
was able to fly beneath the clouds?\e"
M05100008,"\h(《Hans》)I wonder why the Valuans only use their 
superior technology to kill people…\c"
M05100009,"\h(《Hans》)Vyse…
It's time for the final battle…\e"
M05100010,"\h(《Hans》)My father's ship, the Ironclad, is ready 
for action, too!\e"
M05100011,"\h(《Hans》)We have finished working on the Delphinus. 
It is ready when you are!\c"
M05210000,"\h(《Tikatika》)Hey Captain, did you know you can 
see the entire island from up here?\e"
M05210001,"\h(《Tikatika》)Nothing to report today. Well, except for the
fact that Izmael ate Brabham's lunch when he
wasn't looking.\c"
M05210002,"\h(《Tikatika》)Nothing to report today. Well, except that 
Marco has a stomach ache. I think he 
drank water from the pond…\c"
M05210003,"\h(《Tikatika》)Stay away from the pond. Prince Enrique and 
Princess Moegi are saying their final farewells 
before he leaves. Do not invade their privacy.\c"
M05210004,"\h(《Tikatika》)Nothing to report today. But, I did notice that
Princess Moegi seems to be going to the pond
every day to pray…\c"
M05210005,"\h(《Tikatika》)Welcome back, Captain. I was trying to see where
you were going in that little boat, but…\e"
M05210006,"\h(《Tikatika》)even I could not see. This is the first time
these eyes have failed me. The Great Silver
Shrine must really be high up in the sky…\e"
M05210007,"\h(《Tikatika》)I can't quite see that island that rose up from
under the clouds from here… 
even with my eagle-like eyes.\e"
M05210008,"\h(《Tikatika》)But, I can sense the fear of the birds that come
from the direction of Ocean. I have a very bad
feeling about all of this…\e"
M05210009,"\h(《Tikatika》)Nothing to report today. Heh… I can see 
everyone from here!\e"
M05210010,"\h(《Tikatika》)Everyone is so energetic! I can feel their 
spirit. I'm sure we will win the battle 
against the Armada!\c"
M07060000,"\h(《Don》)When I heard this place used to be a desert
island, I figured it would be even more 
depressing than Esparanza.\e"
M07060001,"\h(《Don》)But, you've got a good variety of food and 
drinks here, and you've assembled quite a crew. 
You're doing a great job!\c"
M07060002,"\h(《Don》)Into Deep Sky, huh? I couldn't even make it 
through the Dark Rift. Now I'm about to sail 
into the underworld with you.\e"
M07060003,"\h(《Don》)Vyse, I gotta tell ya. There's never a dull 
moment when you're around. To say that you are 
inspirational would be an understatement.\e"
M07060004,"\h(《Don》)We all would have made it through the Dark Rift 
if you were around back then.\c"
M07060005,"\h(《Don》)Hey, I really want to hear about the Great
Silver Shrine!\e"
M07060006,"\h(《Don》)While you were off adventuring, I was bustin' 
my butt working on these buildings.\c"
M07060007,"\h(《Don》)Hey, something happened to the Yellow Moon. 
It rained Moon Stones on Valua. Then there were
some explosions.\e"
M07060008,"\h(《Don》)I want to put my past behind me, but 
I'm worried about the Valuans. 
They're not all bad, you know.\c"
M07060009,"\h(《Don》)So, this is it, huh?  
If we all make it back, 
we're going to celebrate!\e"
M07060010,\h(《Don》)I got my bottle of loqua ready!\e
M07060011,"\h(《Don》)Let's get 'em, Vyse!\c"
M08030000,\h(《Urala》)Oh… Vyse. Um… this is a really nice tavern.\e
M08030001,"\h(《Urala》)I wish I could serve Yafutoman food to 
everyone on the island…\e"
M08030002,"\h(《Urala》)But, I guess that's impossible without 
renovating the kitchen…\e"
M08030003,"\h(《Urala》)Oh, don't worry about it. 
I just miss my kitchen back home.\c"
M08070000,"\h(《Moegi》)This is a very beautiful island that you've 
found, Vyse. This pond reminds me of home. 
It's relaxing.\e"
M08070001,"\h(《Moegi》)I wish that I could just sit here like this 
forever…\c"
M08070002,"\h(《Moegi》)Something seems to be bothering Prince Enrique…
\e"
M08070003,"\h(《Moegi》)I wish he would tell me what it was. Perhaps 
there is something that I could do to calm him
down…\c"
M08070004,"\h(《Moegi》)Prince Enrique, I know your decision is final. 
I… I understand your loyalty and love for your
country.\e"
M08070005,"\h(《Moegi》)I cannot stop you. But… please, return safely
to me. I could not bear the pain if something
were to happen to you…\c"
M08070006,"\h(《Moegi》)Ever since the island was attacked, I have 
been worried about Prince Enrique. 
I hope that he is safe…\e"
M08070007,"\h(《Moegi》)I know that he is strong, but he's all alone. 
I am trying to hope for the best, but I fear
the worst.\e"
M08070008,"\h(《Moegi》)Please, Prince Enrique, please… 
come back to me.\c"
M08070009,"\h(《Moegi》)I have a really bad feeling about that island 
that rose from Deep Sky.\e"
M08070010,\h(《Moegi》)I get the chills just thinking about it.\c
M08070011,"\h(《Moegi》)I thought I heard Prince Enrique scream
when the Moon Stones fell on Valua.
I hope he is safe.\e"
M08070012,"\h(《Moegi》)Captain Vyse, you believe that 
Prince Enrique is safe, right?\c"
M08070013,"\h(《Moegi》)I am so happy that Prince Enrique came back 
safely. I don't know what I would have done if 
something happened to him.\c"
M08070014,"\h(《Moegi》)Captain Vyse, can you please take me with you 
when you fight against the Armada?\e"
M08070015,"\h(《Moegi》)I don't think I can stand being apart from 
Prince Enrique again… \c"
M08070016,\h(《Moegi》)Perhaps I might be able to help in some way…\e
M08150000,"\h(《Kirala》)That old Izmael really is something. 
Just watching him makes me want 
to start building things for you.\e"
M08150001,"\h(《Kirala》)So, how about it? It will cost you some gold,
but I guarantee you a job well done! I can't 
just sit here while Izmael has all the fun!\e"
M08150002,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Ask Kirala to build something.”
”Maybe some other time.”\e"
M08150003,"\h(《Kirala》)Now we're getting somewhere! So, 
which building do you want me to remodel?\e"
M08150004,"\h(《What do you want to remodel?》)”Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”
”Tavern…… 1,500 gold.”\e"
M08150005,"\h(《Kirala》)Now we're getting somewhere! 
Which building do you want me to remodel?\e"
M08150006,"\h(《What do you want to remodel?》)”Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”
”Tavern…… 1,500 gold.”
”Kalifa's Tent…… 1,000 gold.”\e"
M08150007,"\h(《Kirala》)Hey, I might like building things, but I can't
get any work done if I don't have the gold to
buy supplies.\c"
M08150008,"\h(《Kirala》)So, you want to remodel the living quarters?! 
It's gonna cost 2,000 gold to do that… Are 
you sure you want to go through with it?\e"
M08150009,"\h(《Remodel your living quarters?》)”Yeah, go ahead.”
”Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150010,"\h(《Kirala》)Ok, leave it to me! I'll have it all fixed 
up for you the next time you come back to the
island.\c"
M08150011,"\h(《Kirala》)Oh, you're gonna think things over again? 
Tell me when you make up your mind.\e"
M08150012,"\h(《Kirala》)Hey, I may be good, but I can't do much without 
the gold to pay for everything. Come back later 
when you have enough!\c"
M08150013,"\h(《Kirala》)So, you want to remodel the tavern?  It's gonna
cost 1,500 gold to do that… are you sure you
want to go through with it?\e"
M08150014,"\h(《Remodel the tavern?》)”Yeah, go ahead.”
”Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150015,"\h(《Kirala》)Ok, leave it to me! I'll have it all fixed up
for you the next time you come back to the
island.\c"
M08150016,"\h(《Kirala》)Oh, you're gonna think things over again? 
Tell me when you make up your mind.\e"
M08150017,"\h(《Kirala》)Hey, I may be good, but I can't do much 
without the gold to pay for everything. 
Come back later when you have enough!\c"
M08150018,"\h(《Kirala》)So, you want to remodel Kalifa's tent?
It's gonna cost 1,000 gold to do that… are you
sure you want to go through with it?\e"
M08150019,"\h(《Remodel Kalifa's tent?》)”Yeah, go ahead.”
”Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150020,"\h(《Kirala》)Ok, leave it to me! I'll make her a nicer tent. 
Maybe she'll actually start to give us some 
useful information.\c"
M08150021,"\h(《Kirala》)Oh, you're gonna think things over again? 
Tell me when you make up your mind.\e"
M08150022,"\h(《Kirala》)I see…
Well, if you ever change your mind, 
just let me know.\e"
M08150023,"\h(《Kirala》)Ok, leave it to me!  I'll finish my work by the 
time you come back to this island again.\e"
M08150024,"\h(《Kirala》)Oh, wait… weren't you already going to have
Izmael remodel that for you?\e"
M08150025,"\h(《Kirala》)If you want, I can remodel it instead.
Is that okay?\e"
M08150026,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Have Izmael remodel it.”
”Have Kirala remodel it.”\e"
M08150027,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that I already asked
Izmael to take care of that.\e"
M08150028,"\h(《Kirala》)Hahaha… it's quite alright.
Well, if you ever want me to remodel it later,
just let me know. I'd be happy to do it.\c"
M08150029,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah… but actually, I was having second
thoughts about the whole thing. I decided that I
want you to remodel it.\e"
M08150030,"\h(《Kirala》)Hahaha… I guess you can't deny true
craftsmanship, huh? I'll just let Izmael
know and I'll get the money from him.\e"
M08150031,"\h(《Kirala》)Leave everything up to me, okay?
I'll show you the beauty of Yafutoman
architecture!\c"
M14010000,"\h(《Izmael》)Captain Vyse, your base is done! 
It's not bad considering what I had
to work with here on this island.\e"
M14010001,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow, Izmael, you ARE great! It's hard to believe

not too long ago!\e"
M14010002,"\h(《Izmael》)I told you that I'd take care of business! Well 
then, now that I'm finished building our 
headquarters…\e"
M14010003,\h(《Izmael》)I think I'll take up sailing with you guys!\e
M14010004,"\h(《Vyse》)Anyone who can turn a deserted island into 
a fortress is more than welcome!\e"
M14010005,"\h(《Izmael》)What can I say? 
I'm the greatest carpenter that ever lived!\e"
M14010006,\h(　)Izmael has joined your crew as a ”Carpenter.”\c
M14010007,"\h(《Izmael》)Well, I'm pretty happy with the base, but I 
think I could fix it up a little bit if I 
had more money.\e"
M14010008,"\h(《Izmael》)What do you say? Do you want me to remodel some 
of the buildings?\e"
M14010009,"\h(《Have Izmael remodel a building?》)”That would be great!”

M14010010,\h(《Izmael》)Which building do you want remodeled?\e

M14010014,"\h(《Izmael》)Captain, you don't have enough money. I'd do it 
for free, but I need to buy supplies and stuff. 
Come back when you have the gold.\e"
M14010015,"\h(《Izmael》)So, you want to remodel your living quarters? 
It's gonna cost 2,000 gold to do that… are you 
sure you want to go through with it?\e"
M14010016,"\h(《Remodel the living quarters?》)”Go right ahead.”
”Hmm… let me think this over.”\e"
M14010017,"\h(《Izmael》)Ok, leave it to me! You'll love what 
I'm going to do to the place! I'll be 
finished when you return to the island.\c"
M14010018,"\h(《Izmael》)That's too bad. If you change your mind, 
just let me know!\e"
M14010019,"\h(《Izmael》)Captain, ya don't have enough money. I'd do it

M14010027,"\h(《Izmael》)Ok, leave it to me! I'll build Kalifa a bigger 
tent by the time ya return to the island again. \c"
M14010028,"\h(《Izmael》)That's too bad. If ya change your mind,

M14010031,"\h(《Izmael》)Bam bam baaam!
Didn't ya already ask Kirala to remodel that
building for ya?\e"
M14010032,\h(《Izmael》)I could remodel it instead if ya want me to!\e
M14010033,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Have Kirala remodel it.”
”Have Izmael remodel it.”\e"
M14010034,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh… I almost forgot that I had asked Kirala to
do it. Sorry about that, Izmael.\e"
M14010035,"\h(《Izmael》)Ba-bam!
Looks like you're getting forgetful in your old
age there! Hahahaha!\e"
M14010036,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, actually, I was thinking about it and I
want you to remodel it.\e"
M14010037,"\h(《Izmael》)Aye aye!
I'll get to work right away!\e"
M14010038,"\h(《Izmael》)I'll get the money from Kirala. Don't worry

\c"
M14040000,"\h(《Robinson》)I lost everything that was dear to me… 
I lost it all in the Dark Rift.\e"
M14040001,"\h(《Robinson》)…All I had to keep me going were my memories of
Polly.\e"
M14040002,"\h(《Robinson》)It was during those years in the Dark Rift 
that I realized just how important Polly 
was to me.\e"
M14040003,"\h(《Robinson》)I never knew how much I had, until she was gone.
I'm gonna stay by her side until we finish this.
Then we're heading back to Sailors' Island.\c"
M14040004,"\h(《Robinson》)Captain Vyse… I suppose we will be 
heading off to that awful island now…\e"
M14040005,"\h(《Robinson》)We've got to stop Valua from destroying 
everything. Polly and I have our whole 
lives ahead of us.\c"
M14040006,"\h(《Robinson》)We have to win this battle! 
I'll do everything I can to help you!\e"
Mp0010000,"\h(《Aika》)Now that we've got our own island base, 
I bet you finally feel like a real captain.
Captain Vyse… I like the sound of that.\e"
Mp0010001,"\h(《Aika》)You've sailed around the world in your own ship!
Not many people can say that they've made their
childhood dreams come true, you know.\e"
Mp0010002,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika, you make it sound like I'm ready to
retire. There's still so much that I haven't
seen yet.\e"
Mp0010003,"\h(《Vyse》)And there's still lots of undiscovered treasure 
to be found. We've got a long way to go!\e"
Mp0010004,"\h(《Aika》)Haha, that's so like you! Don't worry, 
I'll be right there with you! Especially 
if there's treasure involved.\c"
Mp0010005,"\h(《Aika》)I'll do my best, Captain Vyse. Haha… 
I like the sound of that. It makes me laugh.\c"
Mp0010006,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, now that we can go higher and lower than 
we ever have before, we can explore all of the 
places where we haven't been yet!\c"
Mp0010020,"\h(《Aika》)Brabham should be finished working on the
Delphinus by now!\e"
Mp0010021,"\h(《Aika》)Let's hurry back to the port, Vyse!\c"
Mp0010007,"\h(《Aika》)I was going to start calling Enrique 
'Prince Pukey,' because he was always 
barfing over the side of the ship…\e"
Mp0010008,"\h(《Aika》)But now, he's become quite a sailor!\e"
Mp0010009,"\h(《Aika》)He'll be okay… Right, Vyse…?\c"
Mp0010010,"\h(《Aika》)When we were kids, remember how everyone
used to describe Deep Sky as a cold, 
dark place where the dead went to rest?\e"
Mp0010011,"\h(《Aika》)I didn't want to believe that my mom and dad 
went to such a horrible place after they died…\e"
Mp0010012,"\h(《Aika》)So, I promised myself that someday, I 
would travel to Deep Sky and see it for 
myself. I wanted to prove everyone wrong.\c"
Mp0010013,"\h(《Aika》)I hope Fina is okay…
She says she is, 
but she looks really sad… \e"
Mp0010014,"\h(《Aika》)Wasn't Elder Prime like a grandfather to her?
Losing him must have been really hard on her.\c"
Mp0010015,"\h(《Aika》)I never thought Galcian would actually 
use the Rains of Destruction!\e"
Mp0010016,"\h(《Aika》)And he did it on his own country, too! 
I can't believe how many people he killed. 
We have to find a way to stop him!\c"
Mp0010022,"\h(《Aika》)So, it all comes down to this battle…
I was really nervous last night, and I didn't
get much sleep.\e"
Mp0010023,"\h(《Aika》)At first, I was scared, but when I thought
about all of the Air Pirates that are here to
fight with us, I started to feel better.\e"
Mp0010024,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, Vyse, everyone's waiting for us at the
Delphinus! Let's hurry back to the port!\c"
Mp0010025,"\h(《Aika》)We really should head back to the Delphinus! 
Everyone is awaiting your orders!\c"
Mp0010026,"\h(《Aika》)Good morning, Vyse!
Thanks for that little talk last night.
I was able to relax enough to get some sleep.\e"
Mp0010027,"\h(《Aika》)I know we can beat Galcian. I have faith in
everyone… And I have faith in you.\e"
Mp0010028,"\h(《Aika》)I'd face anyone if you were fighting by my side.
I'm sure the rest of the Air Pirates feel the
same way.\e"
Mp0010029,"\h(《Aika》)Heh heh… Let's do our best.
Everyone's counting on you, Vy… I mean
Cap'n Vyse!!!\c"
Mp0010030,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, we really should head back to the port!
Everyone is waiting for you to lead us into 
battle!\c"
Mp0010017,"\h(《Aika》)I thought everything would be over once we
defeated Galcian, but it looks like I was wrong,
huh?\e"
Mp0010018,"\h(《Aika》)I'm not scared though, since you're 
here with me… and we've 
made it this far together, right?\e"
Mp0010019,"\h(《Aika》)Ok, let's go beat the snot out of Ramirez so we 
can hurry back here to Crescent Isle, and throw 
the biggest party in history!\c"
Mp0020000,"\h(《Fina》)It's… a very nice island. 
And you even had a room 
made for me, too.\e"
Mp0020001,"\h(《Fina》)I can't believe it… I actually have my own room
in your home base…\e"
Mp0020002,"\h(《Fina》)I feel like I am really a member of the Blue 
Rogues. I… I'm so happy. Thank you, Vyse.\e"
Mp0020003,"\h(《Fina》)When we last saw him, Drachma said that
it wasn't going to be easy for him to
start his life over…\e"
Mp0020004,"\h(《Fina》)Do you think he will rejoin us, 
when he feels better?\c"
Mp0020005,"\h(《Fina》)We've finally gathered all of the Moon Crystals.
My mission is finally over.
Thank you for all your help.\c"
Mp0020006,"\h(《Fina》)We can finally get into Deep Sky? 
I don't know much about it. 
I'm a little scared… \e"
Mp0020007,"\h(《Fina》)I suppose it's time to look for my ship…
Thank you for all you've done for me…\c"
Mp0020020,"\h(《Fina》)So, the Delphinus will be able to sail into
Deep Sky… I never dreamed that I'd have to go
down there.\c"
Mp0020008,"\h(《Fina》)Enrique is going back to his homeland, Valua…\e"
Mp0020009,"\h(《Fina》)I, too, must return to my homeland once we find
my ship. I… I feel almost as if I don't want to
return.\e"
Mp0020010,"\h(《Fina》)I'm all right. I have decided that I can no
longer waste time lamenting over the change that
has occurred in Ramirez. He must be stopped.\e"
Mp0020011,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez and I… We were both raised by the
Elders in the Great Silver Shrine.\e"
Mp0020012,"\h(《Fina》)Among the Elders, Elder Prime was the most
knowledgeable. He knew everything, from 
historical records to current world affairs.\e"
Mp0020013,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez was always the most interested in 
Elder Prime's stories about the Chronicles 
of Arcadia. They'd spend hours together.\e"
Mp0020014,"\h(《Fina》)I think it was Elder Prime's stories that
inspired Ramirez to search for the Crystals. 
I can't believe Ramirez… killed him… \c"
Mp0020015,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse, so many people were killed when 
the Rain of Destruction fell on Valua.\e"
Mp0020016,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez and the Silver Gigas, Zelos, are 
responsible for this.\e"
Mp0020017,"\h(《Fina》)As a Silvite,
I… I should have stopped Ramirez… \c"
Mp0020021,"\h(《Fina》)The time has come at last to face Ramirez.
To be completely honest, it… it's a little hard
for me to fight against him.\e"
Mp0020022,"\h(《Fina》)But, as a Silvite… I must stop him. 
It is my duty. \e"
Mp0020023,"\h(《Fina》)I'll do my best. We must not let
Galcian and Ramirez destroy this world.\c"
Mp0020024,"\h(《Fina》)Galcian and Ramirez must be stopped, 
before more innocent lives are lost.\c"
Mp0020025,"\h(《Fina》)Good morning, Vyse.
Um… thank you for everything last night.\e"
Mp0020026,"\h(《Fina》)To be completely honest, it's a little hard for
me to fight against Ramirez. But…\e"
Mp0020027,"\h(《Fina》)I want to fight. I want to help save this world.
I… I want to fight along side of you.\e"
Mp0020028,"\h(《Fina》)That's why I'll try my best. As long as you are
there fighting with me, somehow I believe we'll
win.\c"
Mp0020029,"\h(《Fina》)Let's go, Vyse. Everyone is probably waiting at
the Delphinus for us.\c"
Mp0020018,"\h(《Fina》)Let's go Vyse, we've got to stop Ramirez. \e"
Mp0020019,"\h(《Fina》)For the sake of this world… and for the memory
of Elder Prime, Ramirez must be stopped.\c"
Mp0040000,"\h(《Enrique》)Hello, Vyse. For a hidden base, 
this is most impressive.\e"
Mp0040001,"\h(《Enrique》)As we acquire more crew members, 
the base, as well as the Delphinus,
will run more smoothly.\e"
Mp0040002,"\h(《Enrique》)You are the only one who has the experience 
and the determination to lead this crew to 
victory. We all look up to you, Vyse!\e"
Mp0040003,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, I have entrusted you with the 
Delphinus. Please take good care of it,
I may want it back someday.\c"
Mp0040004,"\h(《Enrique》)As a Prince of Valua, I knew that someday I 
would eventually return to Valua, but I never
thought I'd have to return from underneath it.\c"
Mp0040005,"\h(《Enrique》)We have obtained all the Moon Crystals at last. 
Now I can finally put an end to my mother's
tyranny.\e"
Mp0040006,"\h(《Enrique》)Although we fight on opposing sides,
she is still my mother.\e"
Mp0040007,"\h(《Enrique》)I hope that I can convince her that what she is 
doing is wrong, and we can come to some
agreement.\c"
Mp0040008,"\h(《Vyse》)Vyse… I'm sorry but could you leave me alone 
for a while?\e"
Mp0040015,"\h(《Enrique》)The modifications on the Delphinus should be
complete. Let us return to the port, Vyse.\c"
Mp0040009,"\h(《Enrique》)Don't give me that worried look of yours. 
I promise you that I will come back. 
Heh… I'm not quite ready to die yet.\e"
Mp0040010,"\h(《Enrique》)I… I just have one request to ask of you, Vyse.
Please… look after Princess Moegi while I am
gone. She… she means so much to me.\c"
Mp0040011,"\h(《Enrique》)So, it's time to confront Galcian. I shall 
accompany you in the Delphinus.\e"
Mp0040012,"\h(《Enrique》)Galcian must pay for destroying my 
homeland, and killing my mother… 
and Gregorio…\c"
Mp0040013,"\h(《Enrique》)This is it… If we win, the world will 
be at peace. We must win this battle!\e"
Mp0040014,"\h(《Enrique》)Let's go, Vyse… No, Captain Vyse!
Lead us to victory!\c"

of.\e"
ML0040007,\h(《Vyse》)Something else?\e
ML0040008,\h(《Belleza》)……\e
ML0040009,"\h(《Belleza》)…That reminds me.
I took a peek into Aika and Fina's room earlier.\e"
ML0040010,\h(《Belleza》)Neither of them were there.\e
ML0040011,\h(《Vyse》)Huh? Are you serious?\e
ML0040012,"\h(《Belleza》)They were probably unable to sleep… You know…
the night before a battle… They aren't as tough
as they pretend to be… \e"
ML0040013,"\h(《Belleza》)A good captain would find them and calm them 
down. \e"
ML0040014,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh, alright.
I'll go check up on them.\e"
ML0040015,\h(《Belleza》)Heh heh… I figured you would.\e
ML0040016,"\h(《Belleza》)Well then…
I must be on my way.\e"
ML0040017,"\h(《Belleza》)I know you'll grow to be a great leader. 
And try not to break too many hearts. 
Good-bye, Vyse.\e"
ML0050000,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, Aika.\e"
ML0050001,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, hey Vyse.\e"
ML0050002,"\h(《Aika》)It looked like you were talking to Fina… 
How's she doing?\e"
ML0050003,\h(《Vyse》)She seemed a little worried about tomorrow… \e
ML0050004,"\h(《Aika》)Hm…
Fina, too, huh?\e"
ML0050005,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse?
What are you doing up this late?\e"
ML0050006,"\h(《Vyse》)Shouldn't I be asking you that question? 
What are you doing out here?\e"
ML0050007,"\h(《Aika》)Haha… Good point…
I should answer you first, I suppose…\e"
ML0050008,"\h(《Aika》)I don't know…
I crawled into bed, but I couldn't sleep.\e"
ML0050009,"\h(《Aika》)Maybe I'm just scared.
Heh… This isn't like me, I guess…\e"
ML0050010,"\h(《What will you say to Aika?》)”Hey, I'm scared, too.”
”Yeah, it isn't like you at all…”\e"
ML0050011,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, don't worry about it. I'm scared, too.
Tomorrow is going to be our toughest battle, 
yet.\e"
ML0050012,"\h(《Aika》)Really?
I didn't think you ever got scared.\e"
ML0050013,"\h(《Vyse》)Just because I've been placed in charge of 
tomorrow's assault, doesn't mean that 
I'm not afraid of anything anymore… \e"
ML0050014,"\h(《Aika》)Haha… I'm sorry.
We've been through so much. I guess it's hard 
for me to remember you as the kid next door.\e"
ML0050015,"\h(《Aika》)That makes me feel a little better…
that I'm not the only one who's scared
around here… \e"
ML0050016,"\h(《Aika》)There's a lot riding on tomorrow's battle… 
I guess it's normal to be scared.\e"
ML0050017,"\h(《Vyse》)I feel the same way.
Hey, I'll bet Galcian is scared, too.\e"
ML0050018,"\h(《Aika》)Hahaha!
I bet he is!\e"
ML0050019,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, it isn't like you at all. Maybe you should
hide under your bed.\e"
ML0050020,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! I said maybe! I didn't come right out and 
say it. And you don't have to make fun of me.\e"
ML0050021,"\h(《Vyse》)I didn't realize that you had a sensitive side, 
too. I think I like it, though.\e"
ML0050022,"\h(《Aika》)…Heh. The only reason why you didn't realize 
that is because every time I try to talk to you,
this is the kind of reaction that I get.\e"
ML0050023,"\h(《Aika》)I'm starting to feel better. Thanks Vyse. 
You've always known how to cheer me up.\e"
ML0050024,"\h(《Aika》)Maybe I'm just feeling the pressure of 
tomorrow's battle. There's a lot riding on it.\e"
ML0050025,"\h(《Aika》)Maybe I should try to relax. We'll do our best 
and whatever happens, happens… \e"
ML0050026,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah.
Just act like you always do, Aika, and 
everything will be fine.\e"
ML0050027,"\h(《Vyse》)All we have to do is fight like we always do… 
We've done pretty good so far!\e"
ML0050028,\h(《Aika》)Yeah… you're right.\e
ML0050029,"\h(《Aika》)I feel so much better now. Maybe I'll be able to
get some sleep.\e"
ML0050030,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright…
I'll see you tomorrow… \e"
ML0050031,\h(《Aika》)…Okay.\e
ML0050032,"\h(《Aika》)Thanks, Vyse.
Let's make history tomorrow… \e"
ML0050033,"\h(《Aika》)Good night!
You better not oversleep! Your Dad's here… 
remember?\e"
ML0060000,\h(《Vyse》)Fina…\e
ML0060001,\h(《Fina》)Vyse…\e
ML0060002,\h(《Vyse》)Can't sleep?\e
ML0060003,\h(《Fina》)I… I tried to… but…\e
ML0060004,\h(《Fina》)…I couldn’t stop thinking about Ramirez.\e
ML0060005,"\h(《Fina》)I grew up with him…
My… my whole life, we were always together… 
We were best friends… \e"
ML0060006,"\h(《Fina》)It's… it's hard to think that now I'm going to 
have to fight him… and one of us 
will die tomorrow… \e"
ML0060007,"\h(《Fina》)As a Silvite, it is my duty, but… \e"
ML0060008,\h(《Fina》)……\e
ML0060009,\h(《Vyse》)Fina…\e
ML0060010,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse.
I have…
I have one thing to ask of you…\e"
ML0060011,\h(《Vyse》)What is it?\e
ML0060012,"\h(《Fina》)Please…
Stay by my side…\e"
ML0060013,"\h(《Fina》)If you were to be next to me… during tomorrow's
battle… I know I'll be able to fight him.\e"
ML0060014,"\h(《Fina》)You're a great leader… I know you will inspire 
me… \e"
ML0060015,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Say comforting words.”
”Say nothing and just put your arm around her.”\e"
ML0060016,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure.
I'll be by your side.\e"
ML0060017,\h(《Fina》)Vyse… Thank you!\e
ML0060018,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, I'll be there for you. This, I promise.\e"
ML0060019,\h(《Vyse》)We'll fight together!\e
ML0060020,\h(《Fina》)…Yes.\e
ML0060021,\h(《Fina》)Vyse…\e
ML0060022,\h(《Fina》)…Thank you.\e
ML0060023,\h(《Vyse》)…Feel better now?\e
ML0060024,"\h(《Fina》)…Yes.
Having you here means a lot to me.\e"
ML0060025,\h(《Fina》)Can we stay like this a little longer…?\e
