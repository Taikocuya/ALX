MH0220000,\h(《Kangan》)How fares the battle?\e
MH0220001,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)My Lord… the Tenkou are swarming all around 
the Valuans, but the Armada is holding their 
position. We seem to be at a stalemate.\e"
MH0220002,"\h(《Kangan》)Heh heh… I see. Very well. 
It is time for us to join the battle 
and end this… once and for all!\e"
MH0290000,"\h(《Aika》)Wow!
The water here is so calm… it looks like glass.\e"
MH0290001,"\h(《Enrique》)It's hard to imagine that this was a volcanic
area covered in lava at one time.\e"
MH0290002,\h(《Aika》)What is that thing?!\e
MH0290003,"\h(《Vyse》)What?!
It looks like a huge bird!\e"
MH0290004,\h(《Fina》)That must be Blueheim.\e
MH0290005,\h(《Vyse》)Bluheim?\e
MH0290006,"\h(《Fina》)Yes, Blueheim was the Blue Gigas.\e"
MH0290007,"\h(《Fina》)It looks like Blueheim was trapped in the lava 
and encased in stone.\e"
MH0290008,"\h(《Enrique》)If that thing ever got free, we'd be in trouble.
The Gigas that you faced so far couldn't fly.
I can't imagine how tough this one would be.\e"
MH0290009,"\h(《Vyse》)We should secure the Blue Crystal as soon as we
can! Let's go!\e"
M01210000,"\h(《Vyse》)What's this rock?
It looks like some sort of switch…\e"
M01210001,"\h(《Enrique》)It looks like it triggered some
sort of water release valve…\e"
M01210002,"\h(《Vyse》)Ah… I see. The switch is probably here to fill
this area with water. Hmm…\c"
M01210003,"\h(《Vyse》)I've already pushed this switch.
The rock is shining brightly.\c"
M01210004,"\h(《Vyse》)It appears that this switch was here to
fill this area with water…\c"
M01210005,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't know where, but I think this switch
probably opened a water valve somewhere in
these ruins…\c"
M01210006,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't know where, but I think this switch
probably opened a water valve somewhere in
these ruins…\c"
M01210007,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't know where, but I think this switch
probably opened a water valve somewhere in
these ruins…\c"
M01210008,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess this passageway and this trap were
both built to prevent people from going any
deeper into this place…\c"
M01210009,"\h(《Vyse》)The room on the other side of this door
is probably filled with the water
we poured in before.\c"
M01210010,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the stone pedestal where
the Blue Moon Crystal was.
There's nothing there now.\c"
M01210011,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)If you ever want to head back to Yafutoma,
just let me know.\e"
M01210012,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Head back to Yafutoma.”
”Stay here a little while longer.”\e"
M01210013,"\h(《Vyse》)We wanted to head back to Yafutoma for
a little bit. Could you give us a lift?\e"
M01210014,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)No problem.
Just climb on board.\c"
M01210015,"\h(《Vyse》)We're fine for now, but we'll let
you know if we change out minds.\e"
M01210016,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)No problem.
Any time you want to go back,
just let me know.\c"
M01210017,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Return to the Delphinus.”
”Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
