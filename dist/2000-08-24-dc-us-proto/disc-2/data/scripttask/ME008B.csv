M90390000,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)I am known as the Mystery Merchant. I bring
goods from around the world. Many of these you 
may never see again!\e"
M90390001,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)I only carry rare and exotic items.
Come! See my wares for yourself!\e"
M90390002,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Buy and Sell Items.”
”Talk about various things.”
”Leave.”\e"
M90390003,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)There exists in this world a rare type of Moon 
Stone shard called ”Abirik Chams”.\e"
M90390004,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Thank you very much. Perhaps our paths shall
cross again some day.\e"
M04000100,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Welcome. How goes the sailing? You wish to buy
cannons to blast your enemies out of the skies?\e"
M04000101,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we don't even have our own ship right now,
to be honest.\e"
M04000102,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well, that is very unfortunate. I wished to show
you my newest weapon called a ”Torpedo.”\e"
M04000103,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)You can even set which round it will strike! It
is perfect for concentrating much firepower into
a short period of time.\c"
M04000104,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well well… Is it not Vyse the Ninny? Who are
you running from this time? Or perhaps you need
a bigger cannon to feel safe?\e"
M04000105,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, kid. How goes the sailing? I have cannons 
for all of your destructive needs!\e"
M04000106,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, kid. How goes the sailing? I have cannons 
for all of your destructive needs!\e"
M04000107,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey… are you not Vyse the Determined? Yes, I 
thought so. Keep up the good work. Do you wish 
to buy a cannon while you are here?\e"
M04000108,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)You are Vyse, are you not? I have heard about 
you. It is time someone put those Valuans in 
line. I respect that.\e"
M04000109,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, it is Vyse the Admirable! Do you wish to buy
a cannon or two from my humble shop? I would be
so happy!\e"
M04000110,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, it is Vyse the Bold! Do you wish to buy a
cannon or two from my humble shop? I would be so
happy!\e"
M04000111,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Ah, it is Vyse!
Heh… I wish that I were known as ”the Valiant” 
like you… \e"
M04000112,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Ah, it is Vyse!
Heh… I wish that I were known as ”the Daring” 
like you… \e"
M04000113,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, it is Vyse the Dashing! Do you wish to buy a
cannon or two from my humble shop? I would be so
happy!\e"
M04000114,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, Vyse! Er… I mean, Vyse the Fearless!
I would be honored if you bought something
from me!\e"
M04000115,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)The Red Moon be praised… I cannot believe that 
an actual hero is shopping in my humble store. 
It is an honor!\e"
M04000116,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)The Red Moon be praised… I cannot believe that 
the King of Rogues is shopping in my humble 
store. It is an honor!\e"
M04000117,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)V, Vyse! You are a legend! I would be so honored
if you wished to buy something from me… It
would make me feel so… important.\e"
M04000000,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, kid. How goes the sailing? I have cannons 
for all your destructive needs!\e"
M04000001,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Buy and Sell Ship Parts.”
”Talk about various things.”
”Leave.”\e"
M04000003,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Check out my new weapons. They're called 
”Torpedoes!”\e"
M04000004,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)After firing, you will not hit the target until 
the following turn, and sometimes you can even 
delay it further, by a round or two!\e"
M04000005,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)It often misses but it is much more powerful 
than most cannons. I highly recommend it.\c"
M04000006,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)You heard that Nasrad was attacked by Valua and 
burned to the ground, yes?\e"
M04000007,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well, apparently the Valuans developed an engine
that allows them to cut through sky rifts,
and they launched a surprise attack.\e"
M04000008,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)It normally would not occur to anyone that they 
could make it through the sky rifts, so I guess 
the defenses were lax.\c"
M04000009,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)I heard a rumor that the Rains of Destruction 
fell upon Valua. Is it really so?\c"
M04000010,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Thank you!
May the Red Moon watch over you.\c"
M04010100,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Are you not the one they call Vyse the Ninny? 
Nice nickname. How did you earn it?\e"
M04010101,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Welcome to the Sailors' Guild. We pay very well 
for information on Discoveries!\e"
M04010102,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Welcome to the Sailors' Guild. We pay very well 
for information on Discoveries!\e"
M04010103,"\h(《Guildmaster》)So, you're the guy that everyone has been 
talking about? The one they call Vyse the 
Respected? Welcome to the Sailors' Guild.\e"
M04010104,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hey, it's Vyse the Admirable! Welcome to the
Sailors' Guild!\e"
M04010105,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hey, you are Vyse the Bold, yes? Welcome to the 
Sailors' Guild!\e"

Everyone has been talking of your exploits.
Welcome to the Sailors' Guild.\e"
M04010107,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Vyse the Daring? Of course I have heard of you. 
Everyone has been talking of your exploits.

Welcome to the Sailors' Guild! It is an honor!\e "
M04010110,"\h(《Guildmaster》)To think that Vyse the Hero would ever come to 
this guild… It is a true honor, sir.\e"
M04010111,"\h(《Guildmaster》)To think that the King of Rogues would ever come
to this guild… It's a true honor, sir.\e"
M04010112,"\h(《Guildmaster》)V, Vyse the Legend?! I feel honored just to be 
able to talk to one as great as yourself! W, 
welcome to the Sailors' Guild!\e"
M04010000,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Welcome to the Sailor's Guild. We pay very well 
for information on Discoveries!\e"
M04010001,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Buy and Sell Discovery information.”
”Talk about various things.”
”Leave.”\e "
M04010002,"\h(《Guildmaster》)What happened? Were you left behind by your 
ship? That is an unfortunate tale.\e"
M04010003,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Hmm… I'm sorry. I know of none who may have a 
ship available for rent right now.\e"
M04010004,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Well, since you are here without much choice, 
you may as well try to enjoy your stay.\e"
M04010005,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I hear there is a beautiful new dancer at the 
bar.\c"
M04010006,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Well, since you are here without much choice, 
you may as well try to enjoy your stay.\e "
M04010007,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I hear there is a beautiful new dancer at the 
bar.\e"
M04010008,"\h(《Guildmaster》)You're searching for ruins in the desert?
If you find them, I hope you'll let me know.
I pay quite well for information on such things.\e"
M04010009,"\h(《Guildmaster》)You are seeking Discoveries? Well, there is 
another named Domingo who is also searching the 
world for Discoveries.\e"
M04010010,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I have heard that he is one of the world's best 
treasure hunters. You should try to stay a 
kukuru's length ahead of him.\c"
M04010011,"\h(《Guildmaster》)In every port of any size, you should always 
find a branch office of the Sailors' Guild. I 
suggest you pay a visit.\c"
M90390005,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)You should try feeding Abirik Chams to Silver 
animals. It will make them grow much faster.\c"

MD0020000,"\h(《Vyse》)So this is Maramba…
It's so… hot!\e"
MD0020001,"\h(《Aika》)…Huh?
Where'd the Cap'n go?\e"
MD0020002,\h(《Vyse》)Hey!\e
MD0020003,"\h(《Aika》)W… wait!
Cap'n! Where are you going?!\e"
MD0020004,"\h(《Drachma》)This is where we part company.
I've got my own quest to worry about. 
I've got to find Rhaknam.\e"
MD0020005,"\h(《Aika》)What?!
W… wait a second!\e"
MD0020006,"\h(《Aika》)What are we supposed to do?
We're in the middle of a desert without a ship.
How are we supposed to continue on our mission?\e"
MD0020007,"\h(《Drachma》)That is not of my concern.
I have no interest in crystals or temples.\e"
MD0020008,"\h(《Drachma》)I must find Rhaknam. 
I cannot waste any more time babysittin'.\e"
MD0020009,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! Come back here,
you eye-patch wearing freak! You rusty old man. 
Hey! Are you listening to me?!\e"
MD0020010,"\h(《Fina》)Oh, my!
This isn't good at all.
What should we do?\e"
MD0020011,"\h(《Aika》)We can't even get out of the city, 
let alone make it to the temple! 
We're stuck here.\e"
MD0020012,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, we have no choice right now other than to
start exploring the city. Maybe we can find
someone who can take us to the temple.\e"
MD0020013,"\h(《Vyse》)That's all we can do… for now.
\e"
MD0020014,\h(《》)Drachma has left the party.\e
MD0050000,"\h(《Bellena》)Good morning.
I trust you slept well last night…\e"
MD0050001,"\h(《Vyse》)It was the best night's sleep I've had in a long
time. So, I guess we should get ready start
exploring the desert?\e"
MD0050002,"\h(《Bellena》)”Only those who have walked through the desert
can truly know its size”, is a saying we have
here in Nasr. \e"
MD0050003,"\h(《Bellena》)It's too difficult to cross the desert on foot,
because of the heat. A mere half day's walk can
be deadly… You'll need a ship to cross it.\e"
MD0050004,"\h(《Vyse》)A ship, huh?
Is this one yours?\e"
MD0050005,"\h(《Bellena》)Ah, yes.
It's not much, but it's very reliable.\e"
MD0050006,\h(《Aika》)Hmph…\e
MD0050007,"\h(《Aika》)… Umm, Bellena, why are you going out of your
way to give us a ride? You don't even know us.\e"
MD0050008,"\h(《Bellena》)You aren't very grateful are you? If you were
dying of thirst, and someone offered you water,
you would probably ask where it came from first.\e"
MD0050009,\h(《Aika》)What?!!! \e
MD0050010,"\h(《Bellena》)… Alright.
If you must know, then I'll tell you.\e"
MD0050011,"\h(《Bellena》)… My father was a soldier. He was a poor man
and sometimes a little short-tempered,
but he was a good man… and a good father.\e"
MD0050012,"\h(《Bellena》)We struggled to get by, and my father was barely
able to support us. We had nothing to rely on
but each other… But we were happy…\e"
MD0050013,\h(《Bellena》)Until that day… 20 years ago…\e
MD0050014,"\h(《Bellena》)20 years ago, Valua and Nasr declared war on
each other.
And my… my father was killed in battle.\e"
MD0050015,"\h(《Bellena》)When he died, we had nothing… no food…
nobody to support us… nobody to raise us…
We had to live on the streets.\e"
MD0050016,"\h(《Bellena》)Some say that you can't die from a broken heart,
but they're wrong… My mother died shortly after
my father… She was so sad… \e"
MD0050017,"\h(《Bellena》)I was alone… and scared. I had to fend for
myself on the streets. And that is how I ended
up living like… this.\e"
MD0050018,\h(《Fina》)Oh… Bellena… We're so sorry… We had no idea…\e
MD0050019,"\h(《Bellena》)Ever since then, I've hated war. Hundreds of
people die… Hundreds more families have to go
through what I went through.\e"
MD0050020,"\h(《Bellena》)And that is why, I'm letting you… 
No, I want you to use my ship. Please…\e"
MD0050021,"\h(《How will you answer?》)”We'll do it!”
”Hm… what should we do?”\e"
MD0050022,\h(《Vyse》)We'll do it!\e
MD0050023,"\h(《Bellena》)…Thank you, oh so much…\e"
MD0050024,\h(《Vyse》)Hm… what should we do?\e
MD0050025,"\h(《Aika》)… Vyse, let's use her ship. We… we know her
reasons… She's doing us a huge favor and it's
the least we can do for her.\e"
MD0050026,"\h(《Aika》)Bellena…
I… I'm sorry for… what I said earlier.
I… I shouldn't have spoken to you that way.\e"
MD0050027,"\h(《Aika》)I lost my parents when I was young, too. 
I know what you went through…\e"
MD0050028,"\h(《Bellena》)Heh heh… that's quite alright.
As long as you understand and don't take my
generosity for granted.\e"
MD0050029,"\h(《Bellena》)Alright everyone, get on board.
The Temple of Pyrynn lies far to the east,
in the middle of the desert. Let's go!\e"
