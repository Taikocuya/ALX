MH0080000,"\h(《Mikado》)So, you came from the land where the sun sets.
Welcome to Yafutoma.\e"
MH0080001,"\h(《Mikado》)My daughter Moegi has always been intrigued with
the West. Haven't you, my dear?\e"
MH0080002,"\h(《Moegi》)Yes, father.
Please, I would love to hear all about your
homeland.\e"
MH0080003,"\h(《Moegi》)And if there is anything that we can do for you,
just ask.\e"
MH0080004,"\h(《Aika》)Sure, but I don't want to be too much of a
burden. \e"
MH0080005,"\h(《Kangan》)King Mikado… as an advisor of the Royal Court,
I must say that I am opposed to the idea of
foreigners entering our lands.\e"
MH0080006,"\h(《Kangan》)Foreigners have only brought us disaster. We
must cleanse them from our lands immediately!\e"
MH0080007,"\h(《Muraji》)I agree with my father!
The Westerners can only bring us trouble. 
We should dispose of them at once.\e"
MH0080008,"\h(《Mikado》)They are our guests. We must welcome them. They 
can teach us a great deal about the West. And 
there is much we can teach them as well.\e"
MH0080009,"\h(《Mikado》)…But I would like to know why you have traveled
to Yafutoma.\e"
MH0080010,"\h(《Vyse》)We're searching for Moon Crystals to prevent our
enemies from using them to destroy the world… 
It is rumored that the Blue Crystal is here.\e"
MH0080011,"\h(《Mikado》)A Blue Crystal?
Hmm… I think you are referring to the jewel
that has the powers of the Blue Moon.\e"
MH0080012,"\h(《Mikado》)The object that you are searching for lies 
underneath Mount Kazai. Here in Yafutoma, 
we refer to the object as the Maga Sphere.\e"
MH0080013,"\h(《Mikado》)Mount Kazai is considered by our people to be 
a holy mountain. And deep within the mountain… 
lies an azure-colored jewel.\e"
MH0080014,"\h(《Mikado》)Our ancestors passed the jewel to the successors
of the throne. After the cataclysm, the jewel 
was sealed inside Mount Kazai.\e"
MH0080015,"\h(《Aika》)An azure-colored jewel?
Vyse! That has to be the Moon Crystal!\e"
MH0080016,"\h(《Mikado》)At one time, Mount Kazai was a volcano, and 
there is no known way inside. The Maga Sphere 
has been lost since the days of the Old World…\e"
MH0080017,"\h(《Mikado》)If you were to retrieve it for us, we would be
eternally grateful…\e"
MH0080018,"\h(《Vyse》)So, the Maga Sphere is at the bottom of that
huge mountain? Leave it to us.\e"
MH0080019,\h(《Vyse》)Don't worry… we'll get it back for you!\e
MH0100000,"\h(《Mikado》)You have done exceptionally well!
No one in Yafutoma has seen the Maga Sphere
since the days of the Old World.\e"
MH0100001,"\h(《Mikado》)You are the first to make it back alive from 
the depths of Mount Kazai. How can I 
repay you for risking your lives to recover it?\e"
MH0100002,"\h(《Vyse》)Well… as we mentioned earlier, we were
wondering if it would be alright if we
borrowed it.\e"
MH0100003,"\h(《Mikado》)Hmm… 
But it is the symbol of royal succession…\e"
MH0100004,"\h(《Mikado》)I would like to keep it in my possession at
least while you remain in Yafutoma.\e"
MH0100005,\h(《Vyse》)Umm… Sure…\e
MH0100006,"\h(《Aika》)Symbol of royal succession, huh?
That makes sense why they want to keep it.\e"
MH0100007,"\h(《Aika》)Moegi… you're Lord Mikado's daughter, right?
So does that make you the successor to
the throne?\e"
MH0100008,\h(《Mikado》)Um…\e
MH0100009,\h(《Moegi》)……\e
MH0100010,"\h(《Mikado》)Well, thank you for retrieving the Maga Sphere!\e"
MH0100011,"\h(《Mikado》)Let us begin the preparations for the feast!
Make yourselves at home and enjoy the
festivities!\e"
MH0100012,"\h(《Aika》)Alright! That's more like it!
I can't wait to taste the gourmet cooking of
Yafutoma!\e"
MH0100013,"\h(《Vyse》)We would be honored to join you,
especially Aika.\e"
MH0100014,\h(《Enrique》)……\e
MH0100015,\h(《Enrique》)Princess… Hmm…\e
MH0100016,"\h(《》)You handed the ”Serene Blue Moon Crystal” 
over to Lord Mikado.\e"
MH0120000,"\h(《Mikado》)Good morning, Vyse.
Did you rest well?\e"
MH0120001,"\h(《Vyse》)Yes, I slept like a rock.
That was my first time sleeping on a… 
floor… mattress… thing.\e"
MH0120002,"\h(《Mikado》)Hahaha, I see.
I am glad you were comfortable.\e"
MH0120003,\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Lord Mikado! It's an emergency!\e
MH0120004,"\h(《Yafutoman Soldier》)Black ships have surrounded the city! And 
what appears to be their Flagship is 
attempting to dock in our harbor.\e"
MH0120005,\h(《Mikado》)What?!\e
MH0120006,\h(《Vyse》)Black ships…? Oh no…\e
MH0120007,"\h(《Aika》)It might be the Armada!!
Vyse, let's hurry back to the port!\e"
MH0120008,\h(《Muraji》)Father…\e
MH0120009,\h(《Kangan》)Yes… Yes… I know…\e
MH0150000,"\h(《Mikado》)No! I will never let the Valuans occupy
Yafutoma!\e"
MH0150001,"\h(《Belleza》)But, King Mikado… you do realize that your 
country's pitiful army wouldn't last 
a day against the Armada.\e"
MH0150002,"\h(《Belleza》)To prevent unnecessary bloodshed,
I recommend that you surrender.\e"
MH0150003,"\h(《Mikado》)We will never surrender! We will never hand
Yafutoma over to a band of bloodthirsty
warlords like yourselves.\e"
MH0150004,"\h(《Mikado》)We are protected by the Blue Moon. In the past,
whenever our country was threatened, the Blue
Winds came to our aid and saved our lands.\e"
MH0150005,"\h(《Mikado》)If you attack us, the winds will blow you into 
the Dark Rift. Valua will never occupy Yafutoma.
Do you hear me? Never!\e"
MH0150006,"\h(《Belleza》)I'm sorry you didn't see things our way.
It appears that this meeting is at an end.\e"
MH0150007,"\h(《Belleza》)Then I will gain possesion of Yafutoma…
by my own means.\e"
MH0150008,\h(《Mikado》)What sort of treachery is this?!\e
MH0150009,"\h(《Muraji》)Heh heh heh…
If you do not keep quiet, you'll be a head
shorter.\e"
MH0150010,\h(《Mikado》)Muraji… You traitor!\e
MH0150011,"\h(《Kangan》)Belleza, in accordance to our meeting last 
night, this country will fall under the rule 
of the Valuan Empire.\e"
MH0150012,\h(《Mikado》)Kangan! What are you saying?!\e
MH0150013,"\h(《Kangan》)King Mikado… as Lady Belleza stated, 
we have no hope of winning 
a war against Valua.\e"
MH0150014,"\h(《Kangan》)To save our people, we abdicate your power and
assume the role as leaders of Yafutoma.\e"
MH0150015,"\h(《Vigoro》)Wow!
Belleza… I'm glad we're on the same side!\e"
MH0150016,"\h(《Belleza》)Don't relax yet, big guy.
Not while the kid is still around.\e"
MH0150017,"\h(《Belleza》)Take King Mikado prisoner and find those
Air Pirates.\e"
MH0280000,"\h(《Mikado》)Brave adventurers from the West… 
I thank you for saving Yafutoma.\e"
MH0280001,\h(《Enrique》)But it was my country that caused all of this…\e
MH0280002,"\h(《Enrique》)I am terribly sorry for all of the trouble
caused by the Valuans… I don't know how I can
make it up to you.\e"
MH0280003,"\h(《Mikado》)Prince Enrique, please… raise your head.
Daigo has explained everything to me.\e"
MH0280004,"\h(《Mikado》)You felt responsible because you are a 
Valuan Prince, but it is not your fault.\e"
MH0280005,"\h(《Enrique》)Thank you for understanding… but we have 
only won the battle. As we speak, 
the Armada is regrouping…\e"
MH0280006,"\h(《Enrique》)Until Valua sets itself back down the path of
righteousness, I will continue to fight them.\e"
MH0280007,"\h(《Mikado》)I see… very well then.
I will pray for your well being.\e"
MH0280008,"\h(《Mikado》)And perhaps the Maga Sphere will aid you in your
fight. Take it with you.\e"
MH0280009,"\h(《Aika》)Really? Are you sure it's okay?
Didn't you say that it is necessary to appoint
a successor to the throne?\e"
MH0280010,"\h(《Mikado》)Hahaha… it doesn't matter.
Even without a symbol, I have such an
accomplished successor already.\e"
MH0280011,"\h(《Daigo》)I've also decided to return to my father and
accept the responsibility of defending my
people.\e"
MH0280012,"\h(《Vyse》)That's great…
Hey, what happened to Kangan and Muraji?\e"
MH0280013,\h(《Daigo》)They were exiled to Tenkou Island.\e
MH0280014,"\h(《Daigo》)We figured that if they spent some time in
exile, they'd realize what they've done and
become better people. Or kill each other.\e"
MH0280015,"\h(《Aika》)Ahaha, I like that plan!
It serves them right!\e"
MH0280016,"\h(《Daigo》)That reminds me, I noticed that your ship isn't
capable of going to great heights or depths.\e"
MH0280017,"\h(《Daigo》)Here, take this with you.\e"
MH0280018,"\h(《Daigo》)This is from my people. It contains all of the
knowledge necessary to enable your ship to fly
higher or lower than you've ever imagined.\e"
MH0280019,\h(《》)Moegi has joined your crew as a ”Delegate.”\c
MH0280020,\h(《Vyse》)Wow! Thank you!\e
MH0280021,\h(《Vyse》)I'll make sure we put it to good use!\e
MH0280022,\h(《Moegi》)……\e
MH0280023,"\h(《Moegi》)…Father.
I have something to ask of you.\e"
MH0280024,"\h(《Moegi》)I…
Please, let me go with these people.\e"
MH0280025,\h(《Mikado》)What?!\e
MH0280026,"\h(《Moegi》)If what they say is true, then there are 
matters of great importance occurring 
in the West.\e"
MH0280027,"\h(《Moegi》)You and Daigo both said you will stay here to
protect our country.\e"
MH0280028,"\h(《Moegi》)But I am helping defend our country…
by helping these people on their quest.\e"
MH0280029,\h(《Mikado》)Hmmm…\e
MH0280030,"\h(《Daigo》)Well said, Moegi.
I am proud to have you as a sister.\e"
MH0280031,"\h(《Daigo》)Prince Enrique… I speak to you not as a fellow
prince, but as a brother concerned for his
sister's well-being. Please take care of her…\e"
MH0280032,"\h(《Enrique》)You have my word.
I will defend her with my life.\e"
MH0280033,"\h(《Enrique》)Princess…
Let us join forces and return peace to
this world.\e"
MH0280034,"\h(《Moegi》)Yes.
Prince Enrique…
I entrust my life to you.\e"
MH0280035,"\h(《Mikado》)Very well then…
It appears I do not have much choice in this
matter anyway.\e"
MH0280036,"\h(《Aika》)Enrique! You're getting much more reliable by
the minute!\e"
MH0280037,"\h(《Aika》)You seem like a different person! Just until
recently, all I ever saw of you was the back of
your head leaning over the railing of the ship!\e"
MH0280038,"\h(《Enrique》)AIKA!!!
Do you have to constantly remind me about that?!\e"
MH0280039,"\h(《Vyse》)Ahahahaha!!!
She's right, Enrique!\e"
MH0280040,\h(《Vyse》)Alright! Let's go home!\e
MH0280041,"\h(《》)You received the ”Serene Blue Crystal.”
You received the ”Book on Ship Polarity.”\c"
