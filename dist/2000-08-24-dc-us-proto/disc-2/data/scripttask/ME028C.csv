MK0110000,"\h(《Gilder》)Umm… Fina?
Where are we?\e"
MK0110001,\h(《Fina》)We are in the Chamber of Elders.\e
MK0110002,"\h(《   》)Fina…
Welcome home.\e"
MK0110003,\h(《Prime Elder》)I trust you have completed your mission.\e
MK0110004,"\h(《Fina》)I'm sorry… 
I collected the Crystals, but they were stolen 
by Ramirez.\e"
MK0110005,\h(《Prime Elder》)…What?!\e
MK0110006,\h(《Aika》)Fina? Who… What is that?\e
MK0110007,"\h(《Prime Elder》)I see you've brought some of the island-dwellers
back with you, how amusing.\e"
MK0110008,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey…
Looks like there's a bunch of them.\e"
MK0110009,"\h(《Elder Halos》)I see…
So Ramirez has turned, after all.\e"
MK0110010,"\h(《Elder Cross》)When he stopped contacting us, we feared the
worst…\e"
MK0110011,"\h(《Elder Stout》)When he was here in the Shrine, he was so
loyal… I can't imagine what made him change.\e"
MK0110012,"\h(《Elder Halos》)If he gave the Crystals to island dwellers, 
this is very grave news indeed…\e"
MK0110013,"\h(《Elder Orbis》)If he has turned, and he has all six Crystals. 
He may release the seal on Zelos. That would
be… tragic.\e"
MK0110014,"\h(《Gilder》)Zelos? What's grave news?
What are you talking about?\e"
MK0110015,"\h(《Fina》)Elder Prime, please, I want to know the truth… \e"
MK0110016,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez said that he was gathering the Moon 
Crystals to raise the Lost Continent, to unleash
the Rains of Destruction… \e"
MK0110017,"\h(《Fina》)He told me that the Silvites called down the 
Rains of Destruction on the Old World.\e"
MK0110018,"\h(《Fina》)Is that true?
Is that what the Crystals are used for?\e"
MK0110019,"\h(《Elder Prime》)So… Young Fina, you have discovered the truth 
about the Crystals… \e"
MK0110020,"\h(《Elder Prime》)I suppose the time has come to tell you 
everything.\e"
MK0110021,"\h(《Elder Prime》)I shall take you to the Hall of Knowledge, where
you will find the truth.\e"
MK0110022,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! What's happening to us?
I don't like thi………\e"
MK0130000,"\h(《Elder Prime》)So now, you understand the truth.\e"
MK0130001,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Fina… when we sent you on your mission, it was
not to stop Valua from using the Gigas… \e"
MK0130002,"\h(《Elder Prime》)It was to once again call down the Rains of
Destruction.\e"
MK0130003,\h(《Aika》)You used her… That's horrible… \e
MK0130004,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Fina, you saw with your own eyes.
The anger… The hate… The suffering…
The death…\e"
MK0130005,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Their quest for power would only consume them… 
We must cleanse the world.\e"
MK0130006,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Vyse… we see in your heart that you have helped
Fina on her quest.\e"
MK0130007,"\h(《Elder Prime》)I will allow you stay here in the Great Silver
Shrine and live in the new world we are about
to create. Will you aid us?\e"
MK0130008,"\h(《What will you say?》)”Who do you think you are?!”
”Let me think about it…”\e"
MK0130009,"\h(《Vyse》)Who do you think you are?!
You think you can just ask us to forget everyone
that we care about?!\e"
MK0130010,\h(《Vyse》)You are no different from Galcian.\e
MK0130011,"\h(《Vyse》)If the world isn't meeting your standards,
then you feel that you can destroy it!?\e"
MK0130012,\h(《Vyse》)I won't allow it!\e
MK0130013,"\h(《Vyse》)It's all so sudden…
I… I need some time to think about it…\e"
MK0130014,"\h(《Aika》)What are you saying, Vyse?!
Are you just going to let all of our friends
and family die?!\e"
MK0130015,"\h(《Elder Prime》)Fina…
You are one of us… you understand… \e"
MK0130016,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MK0130017,"\h(《Fina》)… No. I do not understand! Elders… you are all
wrong! How can you think like this?!\e"
MK0130018,\h(《Elder Prime》)What?!\e
MK0130019,\h(《Fina》)Vyse and the others have taught me something…\e
MK0130020,"\h(《Fina》)I learned that no matter what happens,
you have to be strong.\e"
MK0130021,"\h(《Fina》)Even if your home is burned to the ground…
Even if you're facing impossible odds… 
And even when you don't know who to trust… \e"
MK0130022,"\h(《Fina》)You have to be strong and fight for a better
future!\e"
MK0130023,"\h(《Fina》)I… I believe in what I have learned.
As long as the people of the world have that
strength in their hearts…\e"
MK0130024,\h(《Fina》)…they will be able to overcome anything.\e
MK0130025,"\h(《Fina》)There has to be a way to return peace to the
world without having to call down the Rains of
Destruction!\e"
MK0130026,\h(《Elder Prime》)Fina…\e
MK0130027,"\h(《   》)Heh heh heh…
I'm sorry, but that world now belongs to me.\e"
MK0130028,"\h(《   》)I will bring a new order to the world…
and all shall bow before me! \e"
MK0130029,\h(《Vyse》)Galcian!\e
MK0130030,\h(《Aika》)How did he get here?!\e
MK0130031,"\h(《Galcian》)Heh heh… Did you forget, little girl,
that Ramirez is also a Silvite?\e"
MK0130032,"\h(《Galcian》)He, too, has a ship capable 
of reaching this place.\e"
MK0130033,\h(《Galcian》)I have come to claim the Silver Crystal.\e
MK0130034,\h(《Vyse》)What?!\e
MK0130035,\h(《Gilder》)Look out!\e
MK0130036,\h(《Fina》)NO!!!!!\e
MK0130037,"\h(《Ramirez》)Elders, I understand your wish to mold the world
into how you see fit.\e"
MK0130038,"\h(《Ramirez》)But…
You will not be the ones with the power to make
that decision.\e"
MK0130039,"\h(《Galcian》)Ramirez is much too valuable to me. 
I could not take the Crystal from his body.\e"
MK0130040,"\h(《Galcian》)I thought of taking the Crystal from you, Fina,
but…\e"
MK0130041,"\h(《Galcian》)I realized that there was a much easier way of
getting onel! Haha ha ha ha!!\e"
MK0130042,"\h(《Galcian》)Now, the six Crystals are in my possession.
Watch as the world bows before me.\e"
MK0130043,\h(《Vyse》)Damn… Galcian!\e
MK0130044,\h(《Fina》)Elder…\e
MK0130045,"\h(《Elder Stout》)Do not cry, Fina… 
Elder Prime is now free… 
He has returned to a state of nothing.\e"
MK0130046,"\h(《Elder Halos》)But, Ramirez has acquired all six of the
Crystals…\e"
MK0130047,"\h(《Elder Orbis》)The world will crumble before them…
All is lost… \e"
MK0130048,"\h(《Fina》)…No!
I refuse to give up!\e"
MK0130049,"\h(《Fina》)I can't sit here and watch the people of the
world be slaughtered!!!\e"
MK0130050,"\h(《Fina》)We will stop them! We can't let them unleash
the Rains of Destruction.\e"
MK0130051,\h(《Elder Helos》)Fina… It is hopeless… \e
MK0130052,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse, we've got to go back to Deep Sky 
to find Soltis!\e"
MK0130053,\h(《Fina》)Galcian and Ramirez must be stopped.\e
MK0130054,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright everyone, you heard Fina, 
we've got to stop them.\e"
