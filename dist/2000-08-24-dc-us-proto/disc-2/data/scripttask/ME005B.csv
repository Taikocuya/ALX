MC0040005,"\h(《Aika》)… I'm so tired… I can barely stand.
It's been a long time since I've laid down in a
nice, warm bed… with pillows… and… blankets…\e"
MC0040006,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm tired too Aika, and it's not like we've had 
time to relax since we left Pirate Isle…\e"
MC0040007,"\h(《Aika》)True… and I don't think I'll be able to sleep 
right now, even in a real bed. I can't stop 
thinking about Captain Dyne and the others.\e"
MC0040008,"\h(《Vyse》)…I'm sure they're okay. Let's at least try and 
get some rest while we can.\e"
MC0040009,"\h(《Vyse》)Who knows when we'll be able to sleep in real 
beds again?  \e"
MC0040010,"\h(《Aika》)That's right… you've been cramped on a hammock
in the engine room of the Little Jack for quite
a few nights now…\e"
MC0040011,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't mind the lack of space… it's just that 
the engine is so old… and it's so loud…\e"
MC0040012,\h(《Drachma》)Well excuse me for having an old ship.\e
MC0040013,"\h(《Vyse》)Captain!
I didn't expect you back so soon!\e"
MC0040014,"\h(《Drachma》)If you don't like my ship, you can find yourself
another one.\e"
MC0040015,"\h(《Drachma》)My ship wasn't meant for anyone but me in the 
first place.\e"
MC0040016,"\h(《Vyse》)I didn't mean anything by that! 
I'm really grateful! Honest!\e"
MC0040017,"\h(《Drachma》)You two seem to be takin' things well tonight…
especially considerin' that your friends are 
going to be executed tomorrow.\e"
MC0040018,\h(《Vyse》)What?!\e
MC0040019,"\h(《Drachma》)Tomorrow at dawn, at the Coliseum between Lower
City and Upper City, they will be executed… \e"
MC0040020,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! What should we do?!
If we don't do something, they'll all be killed!\e"
MC0040021,"\h(《Drachma》)Hmm…
What's wrong, Aika?
You're quiet for a change.\e"
MC0040022,"\h(《Aika》)Tomorrow morning…
The Air Pirates… our friends… are going to be 
executed!\e"
MC0040023,"\h(《Vyse》)They said it's going to happen in the Coliseum.
They said that when they execute Air Pirates, 
it draws a huge crowd.\e"
MC0040024,"\h(《Drachma》)Public execution, huh… sounds like
somethin' the people of this town would enjoy.\e"
MC0040025,"\h(《Aika》)We've got to hurry up and rescue them! They'll 
all be killed! Vyse, what shall we do?!\e"
MC0040026,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Let's try and save everyone right now!”
”Let's sneak into the Coliseum!”
”Hm… I… I don't know…”\e"
MC0040027,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's go save everyone right now! 
We can't waste another moment!\e"
MC0040028,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah!
We have to rescue them before it's too late!\e"
MC0040029,"\h(《Drachma》)Now just calm down. If you start runnin' around
haphazardly, you're bound to be caught and 
executed as well.\e"
MC0040030,"\h(《Drachma》)How exactly did you plan to save them if you 
don't even know where they're bein' held?\e"
MC0040031,"\h(《Vyse》)So what are you suggesting we do?!
We're out of time!\e"
MC0040032,"\h(《Drachma》)Well, when you go fishin', it's never good to 
take your boat out in search of fish.\e"
MC0040033,"\h(《Drachma》)Find out where the fish are goin', and wait
there for them to come to you…
That makes sense, right?\e"
MC0040034,\h(《Aika》)Let them come to you…\e
MC0040035,"\h(《Aika》)Of course!
We know that they'll be at the Coliseum tomorrow
morning!\e"
MC0040036,"\h(《Vyse》)So all we have to do is wait for them to come to
the Coliseum and rescue them there!\e"
MC0040037,\h(《Drachma》)Exactly.\e
MC0040038,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm…
Tomorrow, we'll sneak into the Coliseum.\e"
MC0040039,"\h(《Vyse》)Dad and the others will definitely be taken 
there tomorrow morning… we'll rescue them then.\e"
MC0040040,"\h(《Aika》)What? You mean you're not going to try and save
them right now?!\e"
MC0040041,"\h(《Vyse》)If we start frantically searching everywhere, 
we'll probably get caught by the Valuan Guards 
and if that happens, we're all dead.\e"
MC0040042,"\h(《Drachma》)Vyse is right. But, it may get a little ugly at
the Coliseum tomorrow… but it's our best chance
to save them.\e"
MC0040043,"\h(《Aika》)So, tomorrow morning at the Coliseum it is!\e"
MC0040044,"\h(《Aika》)Now that we sort of have a plan, I feel a little
better! I think it will work… besides, we have 
the element of surprise on our side.\e"
MC0040045,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… I… I don't know. We don't have any more 
time. What should we do, Aika?\e"
MC0040046,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, you're embarrassing me!
Why can't you be more decisive?!\e"
MC0040047,"\h(《Aika》)I can't sit here any longer! 
Let's go find them right now!\e"
MC0040048,\h(《Drachma》)You'd be makin' a huge mistake.\e
MC0040049,"\h(《Drachma》)Well, when you go fishin', it's never good to 
take your boat out in search of fish.\e"
MC0040050,"\h(《Drachma》)Find out where the fish are goin', and wait 
there for them to come to you…
you understand?\e"
MC0040051,\h(《Aika》)Wait… for them… to come to us?\e
MC0040052,"\h(《Aika》)Of course!
We know that everyone will be taken to the 
Coliseum tomorrow morning!\e"
MC0040053,"\h(《Vyse》)So all we have to do is wait for them to come to
the Coliseum and we can rescue everyone then!\e"
MC0040054,\h(《Drachma》)Exactly.\e
MC0040055,"\h(《Vyse》)So, that's our plan.
Tomorrow we will break into the Coliseum and 
rescue everyone!\e"
MC0040056,\h(《Vyse》)Who's there?!\e
MC0040057,"\h(《Drachma》)Someone was spyin' on us! 
Don't let him get away!!!\e"
MC0040058,\h(《Aika》)Vyse! Need a lift?\e
MC0050000,\h(《Marco》)Put me down you glass eyed freak.\e
MC0050001,"\h(《Vyse》)What the…?
You're that kid from this afternoon!\e"
MC0050002,"\h(《Marco》)So, what's it to you?
PUT ME DOWN NOW!\e"
MC0050003,"\h(《Marco》)Ow!
You didn't have to drop me!\e"
MC0050004,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!
Did you catch him?\e"
MC0050005,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, no…
It's that annoying kid again.\e"
MC0050006,"\h(《Marco》)Who are you calling annoying?!
At least I don't have hair like a scarecrow!\e"
MC0050007,"\h(《Marco》)Heh, I heard EVERYTHING you said. Now, if I was 
to rat on you to the guards… 
you'd all be executed!\e"
MC0050008,"\h(《Drachma》)Well… that really leaves us no choice. 
We're goin' to have to kill you now, boy.\e"
MC0050009,\h(《Aika》)W… wait!! Cap'n!\e
MC0050010,"\h(《Marco》)Humph! If you're going to kill me, then kill me!
It's not like anyone would care! 
I don't even think the rats would miss me.\e"
MC0050011,"\h(《Marco》)I've pretty much given up on life in this dump! 
If I'm dead, at least I won't have to search the
garbage bins for food every night.\e"
MC0050012,"\h(《Drachma》)Really… good.
Then you have no regrets… \e"
MC0050013,"\h(《Aika》)Cap'n!!
He's just a kid!\e"
MC0050014,\h(《Vyse》)…\e
MC0050015,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, Marco.
That hole in the ground next to you…
What is it?\e"
MC0050016,"\h(《Marco》)Oh… this? There's Catacombs under the city…
I've heard that they've been around since the
Old World.\e"
MC0050017,"\h(《Marco》)Now, they're just sewers…
This is… where I live.\e"
MC0050018,"\h(《Vyse》)Sewers, huh?
Can you use them to get to the Coliseum?\e"
MC0050019,"\h(《Marco》)Yeah, it reaches the Coliseum… 
W… wait a second…
You were serious!?\e"
MC0050020,"\h(《Vyse》)Yup.
If we take the Catacombs to the Coliseum, we can
sneak in without worrying about the guards.\e"
MC0050021,"\h(《Marco》)AHAHAHAHA!!!!!
What're you, stupid or something?\e"
MC0050022,"\h(《Marco》)You're going to get caught! There's no way! 
Why don't you just give up and go home?\e"
MC0050023,"\h(《Vyse》)Can't do that. Blue Rogues never give up!  
Especially when their friends are counting on 
them.\e"
MC0050024,"\h(《Vyse》)Marco, if you ever went sailing and ran into a 
storm, with the way you're talking, 
you'd probably just give up.\e"
MC0050025,"\h(《Vyse》)”It's too rough! I shouldn't have gotten on this
ship! I want my mommy!”,
is what you'd probably say.\e"
MC0050026,\h(《Marco》)W… what?! Take that back!\e
MC0050027,"\h(《Vyse》)Even if you run into a storm, there's always a
way out. No matter how bleak things seem.\e"
MC0050028,"\h(《Vyse》)I've been in really bad situations before and I
always look for a way out. I'm in that kind of a
situation now, and I'm not giving up!\e"
MC0050029,"\h(《Marco》)… So, so what are you trying to say?\e"
MC0050030,"\h(《Vyse》)Captain… Aika… tomorrow, we're taking the 
Catacombs to the Coliseum.\e"
MC0050031,"\h(《Vyse》)Since, we don't have to get there until 
tomorrow. We should rest tonight.\e"
MC0050032,"\h(《Marco》)Hey!
Aren't you supposed to kill me now?\e"
MC0050033,"\h(《Vyse》)You're going to be at the Coliseum with us 
tomorrow, too.\e"
MC0050034,"\h(《Vyse》)You said that you've grown tired of living,
right? Well, I just want you to see something
interesting before you die.\e"
MC0050035,"\h(《Marco》)What?
You can't be serious…\e"
MC0220000,"\h(《》)Now we had a plan… With our objective in mind, 
we hurried back to the inn, crawled into our 
soft, warm beds, and were fast alseep.\e"
MC0220001,"\h(《》)Morning came much too soon. The skies were so 
dark that it felt like the sun had deserted us. 
Quietly, we all hoped that this wasn't an omen.\e"
MC0220002,"\h(《Aika》)It all comes down to today… 
I hope we can save them…\e"
MC0220003,"\h(《Vyse》)… Let's go to the entrance to the Catacombs and
get to the Coliseum. Either we all go home, or 
none of us go…\e"
M02110000,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)The people of this town are forced to do manual
labor for practically nothing… and they do it
until the day they die.\e"
M02110001,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)If we tried to resist, the guards would just
kill us. I don't know if that's necessarily
worse, though. We have no dreams… no hopes…\c"
M02120000,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)We don't have much to look forward to in this
city… One of our few pleasures in life is
watching shows at the Coliseum.\e"
M02120001,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)Sometimes, they have criminals fight each other
in a duel to the death… or they execute Air
Pirates that dared to resist Valua.\e"
M02120002,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)For some reason, it's comforting seeing someone
in a worse position than ourselves…\e"
M02120003,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)Hm? Your face… you seem strangely familiar…
Heh, for a second, you reminded me of one of
those pirates that broke out of the Coliseum.\e"
M02120004,"\h(《Lower City Valuan》)Nah, that couldn't be you… He was a giant of a
man and used swords bigger than he was!
I swear it!\c"
M02130000,"\h(《Little Girl》)They say that in Upper City, you can eat as much
white bread as you want.\e"
M02130001,"\h(《Little Girl》)I've never eaten white bread, only hard, black
bread… I hear people never chip their teeth
on white bread. I'd like to try it sometime…\c"
M02130002,"\h(《Little Girl》)Everyone went to the Coliseum.
I wonder what they're doing there…\e"
M02130003,"\h(《Little Girl》)I asked my mommy to take me there, too, but she
said that children aren't allowed to go…\e"
M02130004,"\h(《Little Girl》)Marco used to take care of me and play with me
when I was little… but now he's gone.
He left Valua…\e"
M02130005,"\h(《Little Girl》)But, he promised me that he'd come back and get
me out of here, too.\e"
M02130006,"\h(《Little Girl》)So, I'm going to wait right here until Marco
comes back for me!\e"
M02140000,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Hm? Are you going to stay the night?
It's 80 gold a night.\e"
M02140001,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Stay the night.”
”Leave.”\e"
M02140002,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess we'll stay the night.
We've got another guy joining us… a big,
old man. He'll pay for the room.\e"
M02140003,"\h(《Innkeeper》)…You better be telling the truth, for your own
sake. If he doesn’t come, I'll be knocking on
your door.\e"
M02140004,"\h(《Vyse》)Okay, okay. If he doesn't come, then you can
kick us out if you want. We'll be heading off
to the room now.\c"
M02140005,"\h(《Innkeeper》)The room is on the second floor.
And try not to mess it up.\c"
M02140006,"\h(《Innkeeper》)You've rested enough haven't you?
Get going.\e"
M02140007,"\h(《Innkeeper》)What are you doing, window shopping?
Get moving.\c"
M02140008,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Hey, what's this?! You don't have enough money!
Get out of here!\c"
M02140009,\h(《Eavesdropper》)Oh no!\e
M02140010,"\h(《》)The eavesdropper dropped something in his haste.
\e"
M02140011,\h(《》)You received 1 ”Sap Leaf.”\e
M02140012,"\h(《Eavesdropper》)I, it's now or never!!\c"
Ms005b000,"\h(《ヴァイス》)うえっ、生ゴミのいやなニオイ。
ゴミ箱はあっても、ちゃんと
始末されてないみたいだ。\c"
Ms005b001,"\h(《ヴァイス》)「バルア帝国国営製鉄工場」……
この先は工場地帯なのか。
うー、空気がくさい。\c"
Ms005b002,"\h(《ヴァイス》)ボイラーかな。
ガタガタ、すごい音を立ててる。
爆発するんじゃないだろうな〜。\c"
Ms005b003,"\h(《ヴァイス》)しけっぽくてかび臭いなあ。
長いこと干してないのかな。
こりゃハンモックの方がマシか？\c"
Ms005b004,"\h(《ヴァイス》)洗面台にホコリが積もってる。
あんまり宿泊客が
来ないんだろうな。\c"
Ms005b005,"\h(《ヴァイス》)モップはまっくろでベロベロだ。
何年使ったらこうなるんだろう。\c"
Ms005b006,"\h(《ヴァイス》)若い男と女の写真が飾ってある。
女のほうは、ここのおかみさんの
若い頃かな……\c"
Ms005b007,"\h(《ヴァイス》)今は、あの人影を
追わなくては！
こっちは逆方向だ！\c"
Ms005b008,"\h(《ヴァイス》)あの人影は屋根の上に逃げた。
こっちも屋根に飛び移らないと
追いつけないぞ！\c"
