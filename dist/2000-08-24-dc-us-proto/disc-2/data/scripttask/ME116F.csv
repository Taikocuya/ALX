MG0120000,\h(《Vyse》)What the?!\e
MG0120001,"\h(《Enrique》)You've probably already figured out that we're
on the bridge of a ship.\e"
MG0120002,"\h(《Enrique》)Say hello to the Delphinus, the newest member
of the Armada.
This is my personal Flagship.\e"
MG0120003,"\h(《Enrique》)It is heavily armored, and can still match the
top speed of our Cruisers. And it is equipped
with the weaponry of a Heavy Battleship.\e"
MG0120004,\h(《Vyse》)It's amazing!\e
MG0120005,"\h(《Enrique》)This ship is the prototype. Soon, we will begin
building a whole fleet of Delphinus Class Ships.\e"
MG0120006,"\h(《Enrique》)Valua plans to use these ships to take over the
world.\e"
MG0120007,"\h(《Gilder》)With a whole fleet of ships like this, Valua
would easily be able to take over the world.
Especially since Nasrad has fallen.\e"
MG0120008,"\h(《Gilder》)So, your Royalness… There's still one thing
that I can't figure out.\e"
MG0120009,"\h(《Gilder》)Why would you help us escape, then take us to
the bridge of your Flagship? You've gone through
a lot of trouble just to show off…\e"
MG0120010,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah.
Gilder has a good point.\e"
MG0120011,\h(《Enrique》)I…\e
MG0120012,"\h(《Enrique》)I want you to take this ship…
and I want you to take me with it.\e"
MG0120013,\h(《Vyse》)WHAT?!\e
MG0120014,\h(《Aika》)Are you serious?\e
MG0120015,"\h(《Enrique》)Valua has been taking over other countries by
force, destroying their lands, and murdering
the innocent.\e"
MG0120016,"\h(《Enrique》)As a Prince of the Valuan Empire, all of the
innocent blood spilled by the Armada is on my
hands.\e"
MG0120017,"\h(《Enrique》)I've done all I can to convince the Empress, and
Galcian, that what Valua is doing is wrong, but
I cannot convince them to change their ways.\e"
MG0120018,"\h(《Enrique》)Everything I have tried has failed.
I am powerless to stop them. \e"
MG0120019,\h(《Enrique》)My only chance for redemption is to aid you.\e
MG0120020,"\h(《Enrique》)Please! Take me with you!
I will even go with you as a hostage.\e"
MG0120021,"\h(《What will you say?》)”Of course you can come with us.”
”Sorry, but you can't expect us to trust you.”\e"
MG0120022,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course you can come with us.
But, there is one problem… the Blue Rogues
don't take hostages.\e"
MG0120023,"\h(《Vyse》)If you want to sail with us, you must do so
as a Blue Rogue.\e"
MG0120024,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm sorry, but you can't expect us to trust you.
How do we know you won't betray us?\e"
MG0120025,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! He already saved our lives once.
Haven't you been listening to what he's been
saying?! We have to believe him…\e"
MG0120026,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse…
I… I believe him.\e"
MG0120027,"\h(《Fina》)When I was taken to the palace, I saw him
confront the Empress in front of her subjects.
He did everything he could to try and stop her.\e"
MG0120028,"\h(《Fina》)He just helped us escape from the guards, and 
he's giving us this ship. He is committing 
treason to help us.\e"
MG0120029,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse, if we don't take him with us,
he will be executed as a traitor.\e"
MG0120030,\h(《Vyse》)……\e
MG0120031,"\h(《Vyse》)… I understand.
But, there is still one more problem… the Blue
Rogues don't take hostages.\e"
MG0120032,"\h(《Vyse》)If you want to sail with us, you must do so as
a Blue Rogue.\e"
MG0120033,"\h(《Enrique》)… Thank you!
I will do my part as a member of your crew!!\e"
MG0120034,"\h(《Vyse》)You know, I don't think we've been properly
introduced. I'm Vyse of the Blue Rogues.\e"
MG0120035,"\h(《Enrique》)It is an honor to be a member of your crew,
Vyse.\e"
MG0120036,"\h(《Aika》)I never would've thought that I'd be riding in
the same ship as a Valuan, let alone,
the Prince of Valua.\e"
MG0120037,"\h(《Aika》)But…
The Crystals are still in the hands of the
Valuans…\e"
MG0120038,\h(《Fina》)Yes… You're right…\e
MG0120039,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, technically, you are right.\e"
MG0120040,\h(《Aika》)What?!\e
MG0120041,"\h(《Enrique》)I have the Crystals. I stole them before I came
to the docks to find you. I was going to destroy
them…\e"
MG0120042,"\h(《Enrique》)But perhaps it would be best if I returned them
to you. Please, take them.\e"
MG0120043,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! Enrique, you've done so much for us
already…
Thank you!\e"
MG0120044,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh, you act an awful lot like an Air Pirate,
for a Prince.\e"
MG0120045,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright, start the engines!!
Let's take the Delphinus and get out of here!!\e"
MG0120046,\h(《   》)Yeah!!\e
MG0120047,"\h(《》)You have reacquired the ”Red Moon Crystal” and 
the ”Green Moon Crystal.”\e"
MG0130000,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's go!
Delphinus, full speed ahead!!!\e"
MG0130001,\h(《Vyse》)They sealed off the entrance!\e
MG0130002,"\h(《Gilder》)I wouldn't worry too much about the fortress. 
The spot where I blew up the cannon should be
weak.\e"
MG0130003,"\h(《Gilder》)And if this ship's got the firepower that the
Prince said, we should be able to blast our
way out.\e"
MG0130004,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, here goes!\e"
