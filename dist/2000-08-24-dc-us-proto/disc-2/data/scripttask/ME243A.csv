MC0010000,"\h(《Valua National Guard Fleet》)You are entering Valuan airspace.
Present your Entry Passport.\e"
MC0010001,"\h(《Valua National Guard Fleet》)Without the proper credentials, you must leave 
immediately or we will destroy your ship.\e"
MC0010002,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, if it's a passport you want, we have one.
Here…\e"
MC0010003,"\h(《Valua National Guard Fleet》)…Hmm. I can see you just left Valua recently. 
Welcome back.\e"
MC0010004,\h(《Valua National Guard Fleet》)We will escort you inside.\e
MC0010005,"\h(《Aika》)Looks like we made it through. We just passed a 
Valuan Security Checkpoint, that's quite 
an accomplishment, don't you think?\e"
MC0010006,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah…
I thought getting into Valua would be a lot
tougher. Now all we have to do is sneak into…\e"
MC0010007,\h(《Vyse》)…!\e
MC0010008,"\h(《Aika》)Huh?
What's that?!\e"
MC0010009,"\h(《Drachma》)It's the only entrance into the city Valua…
The ”Grand Fortress”.\e"
MC0010010,"\h(《Drachma》)Valua is surrounded by impassable mountains… 
so that is the only way in or out.\e"
MC0010011,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
I can't believe they actually built something 
that big…\e"
MC0010012,"\h(《Drachma》)During the Valua-Nasr War, over 100 Nasr
Warships bombarded this fortress for days.\e"
MC0010013,"\h(《Drachma》)However, all the shells were repelled by 
these walls. The Fortress may be the strongest 
structure of the new world.\e"
MC0010014,"\h(《Aika》)Look!
It's moving!!!\e"
MC0010015,"\h(《Drachma》)The door of the fortress opens only once a day 
to allow ships to pass through.\e"
MC0010016,"\h(《Drachma》)The backside of that wall is completely lined 
with cannons. It was those cannons that nearly 
wiped out the entire Nasr fleet.\e"
MC0010017,"\h(《Vyse》)Defense and offense all in one…
It's an invincible fortress.\e"
MC0010018,"\h(《Aika》)That's where they're holding Captain Dyne… 
and Fina!\e"
MC0010019,\h(《Drachma》)No prisoner has ever escaped from that fortress.\e
MC0010020,"\h(《Drachma》)Although, I've heard that there's one way out.\e"
MC0010021,\h(《Vyse》)Really? Then it's possible?\e
MC0010022,"\h(《Drachma》)Yeah. 
After they execute prisoners, their corpses are
thrown off of the island. \e"
MC0010023,\h(《Aika》)That's just great! What are we going to do now?\e
MC0010024,"\h(《Vyse》)Hah!
No one's ever escaped, because I've never tried!
I love a challenge!\e"
MC0010025,"\h(《Vyse》)Don't worry. I will rescue our friends and 
escape from that fortress. Just watch me!\e"
MC0030000,"\h(《Vyse》)So, this is the capital of Valua, huh?
It's impressive…\e"
MC0030001,"\h(《Aika》)It's beautiful…
But the skies are so gloomy…\e"
MC0030002,"\h(《Drachma》)Valua is a beautiful city, but because of the
fierce thunderstorms caused by the Yellow Moon,
the city is shrouded in eternal darkness.\e"
MC0030003,"\h(《Drachma》)That's the Imperial Palace straight ahead of us.
The area on the left shore is called Upper City.\e"
MC0030004,\h(《Vyse》)Upper City?\e
MC0030005,"\h(《Drachma》)The people of Valua are either very rich, or 
very poor and they detest each other. Only the 
richest people in Valua can live in Upper City. \e"
MC0030006,"\h(《Drachma》)The less fortunate are confined to Lower City. 
It's on the right shore.\e"
MC0030007,"\h(《Aika》)It doesn't seem right to force them to live in 
poverty like that!\e"
MC0030008,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, Captain…
Where should we land?\e"
MC0030009,"\h(《Drachma》)In Lower City.
There is a dock there that repairs and remodels 
ships.\e"
MC0030010,"\h(《Vyse》)Aye aye.
I'll bring us into the Lower City Port.\e"
MC0160000,"\h(《Dyne》)You were late, Vyse.
We decided to come get you and from the looks of
it, we were just in time.\e"
MC0160001,"\h(《Dyne》)Fina, are you alright?\e"
MC0160002,"\h(《Fina》)Yes.
Thank you very much.\e"
MC0160003,"\h(《Fina》)… I'm very grateful that you've gone through 
so much trouble to rescue me…\e"
MC0160004,"\h(《Aika》)Relax Fina… We're all okay right now…
Save the mushy stuff for later…\e"
MC0160005,"\h(《Drachma》)She is right. We can all be thankful after 
we've gotten out of Valua.\e"
MC0160006,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Captain, emergency!
They're closing the gates!!!\e"
MC0160007,"\h(《Drachma》)If the gate closes, we're all dead!\e"
MC0160008,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)We're under attack!
Valuan ships, dead ahead!
They're blocking the entrance!\e"
MC0160009,"\h(《Drachma》)We've got to act fast!
We need to take out that blockade!\e"
MC0160010,"\h(《Drachma》)Looks like I'm goin' to be able to test out the
Harpoon Cannon earlier than I thought!
All hands to battlestations!\e"
MC0160011,\h(《》)Drachma has joined the party… again.\e
MC0170000,"\h(《Vyse》)Looks like that was the last of them!
Now we just need to get through that gate!\e"
MC0170001,\h(《Aika》)Vyse! It's closing! Hurry!!!\e
MC0170002,"\h(《Vyse》)Come on!!! Come on, Little Jack!!!!!\e"
MC0170003,\h(《Vyse》)Woohoo!!! We did it!!!\e
MC0170004,"\h(《Aika》)Alright!!! I knew you could do it Vyse! 
You're the greatest!\e"
MC0170005,"\h(《Dyne》)You got us through their by the skin of our 
teeth. You had me worried for a second there.\e"
MC0170006,\h(《Vyse》)We can finally say good-bye to Valua!\e
MC0170007,\h(《Vyse》)Alright! Let's go back home to Pirate Isle!\e
MG0140000,\h(《Vyse》)We did it!\e
MG0140001,"\h(《Aika》)I can't believe it! We just broke through the
Grand Fortress.\e"
MG0140002,\h(《Gilder》)You sure know how to break in a new ship.\e
MG0140003,"\h(《Fina》)Now, we can finally continue on our search for
the other Moon Crystals!!\e"
MG0140004,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, Valua, it looks like this is goodbye for
now…\e"
MJ0200000,"\h(《Galcian》)Ramirez… what is the status on the construction
of Dangral Island?\e"
MJ0200001,"\h(《Ramirez》)The construction of the port is complete. And
De Loco's Flagship is currently being fitted so
that it will be able to submerge into Deep Sky.\e"
MJ0200002,"\h(《Ramirez》)I've also received word that the elevator
leading to the bottom of Deep Sky has been
completed as well.\e"
MJ0200003,"\h(《Galcian》)Excellent.
The time grows near…\e"
MJ0200004,"\h(《Galcian》)Soon, the foolish Empress and the rest of the
people of the world will bow before my might…\e"
MJ0200005,"\h(《Galcian》)No…
Not just the people…\e"
MJ0200006,"\h(《Galcian》)The people… and even those revered Moons…
Soon, they will all be in my grasp.\e"
MJ0200007,"\h(《Galcian》)The people, the lands, and even the Moons…
They will belong to me…\e"
MJ0200008,"\h(《Ramirez》)You shall reign supreme, Lord Galcian…\e"
MJ0200009,"\h(《Galcian》)Tomorrow morning, I will leave for Dangral. 
I wish to oversee the final stages of the 
construction myself.\e"
MJ0200010,"\h(《Galcian》)And tell the other Admirals to assemble at 
Dangral. I wish to know where they stand…\e"
MJ0200011,"\h(《Ramirez》)Yes, Lord Galcian…\e"
MJ0200012,"\h(《Galcian》)I walk the path of death and destruction…
I know you are a Silvite… If you wish to change
your mind, now is the time.\e"
MJ0200013,"\h(《Ramirez》)I chose long ago to walk the path that you walk
upon, Lord Galcian. I shall forever be at your
side.\e"
MJ0200014,"\h(《Ramirez》)And I will cut down any of those that block our 
path. It is my duty… It is my purpose…\e"
