MG0020000,\h(《Vyse》)I hate Valua.\e
MG0020001,\h(《Vyse》)It's always so dark and gloomy here.\e
MG0020002,"\h(《Gilder》)Yeah, especially when you're locked up in a jail
cell. \e"
MG0020003,"\h(《Gilder》)Valuans have no sense of hospitality…
Hey guards, can we get some food in here?!
How about a drink or something?\e"
MG0020004,\h(《Aika》)I can't believe we're back in Valua.\e
MG0020005,\h(《Aika》)I wonder where Vyse and Fina are being held…\e
MG0020006,\h(《Manly Voice》)Is this where the Air Pirate girl is being held?\e
MG0020007,"\h(《Jail Guard》)Yes, Admiral Vigoro. But sir… 
Why does that concern you?\e"
MG0020008,"\h(《Vigoro》)Hey, don't worry about it. Now run along and go
make yourself useful somewhere else.\e"
MG0020009,"\h(《Vigoro》)Well, what do we have here? 
Nice legs and curves in all the right places.\e"
MG0020010,"\h(《Vigoro》)Well, I suppose you could be a little more curvy
up top.\e"
MG0020011,"\h(《Aika》)Who are you?!
And are you always this crude?\e"
MG0020012,"\h(《Vigoro》)I am Vigoro, the toughest man in the Armada.
I'm surprised you haven't heard of me.
The women I've been with love to brag.\e"
MG0020013,"\h(《Aika》)I've never heard of you before in my life!!
Where are Vyse and Fina being held?!\e"
MG0020014,\h(《Aika》)…!?\e
MG0020015,"\h(《Aika》)Get away from me, you creep. You're all sweaty 
and you've got a serious body hair problem. 
And what's that smell?\e"
MG0020016,"\h(《Vigoro》)Aww, c'mon Red… 
Let's do things I'm gonna tell my friends 
we did anyway.\e"
MG0020017,\h(《Vigoro》)The two of us can make beautiful music together.\e
MG0020018,"\h(《Aika》)Yuck, you're disgusting!\e"
MG0030000,"\h(《Vyse》)This is shaping up to be a great day… Let's
see, so far we got captured, separated from Aika
and Fina… And we lost all of the Crystals.\e"
MG0030001,"\h(《Vyse》)What's next? Maybe they'll torture us… 
A perfect end to a perfect day.\e"
MG0030002,"\h(《Gilder》)Vyse, you're only making things worse.
Take it easy.\e"
MG0030003,\h(《Vyse》)…Huh?\e
MG0030004,"\h(《Gilder》)Oh, Willy.
How're you doing?\e"
MG0030005,"\h(《Willy》)Very bad!
Very bad!\e"
MG0030006,"\h(《Gilder》)Haha, is that so?
Well, you had to fly all the way over here. 
I'm not surprised.\e"
MG0030007,"\h(《Vyse》)Gilder…
There's a note tied to Willy's leg with a piece
of wire…\e"
MG0030008,"\h(《Gilder》)”We will begin bombarding the fortress at 
midnight, and will await your arrival 
just outside… The Claudia.”\e"
MG0030009,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh… This isn't the first time my men have had
to break me out of a prison…
They know the routine.\e"
MG0030010,"\h(《Gilder》)Well, the Claudia may not be able to destroy the
Grand Fortress by herself, but she'll cause 
quite a bit of a commotion.\e"
MG0030011,\h(《Vyse》)That's when we can make our escape!\e
MG0030012,\h(《Gilder》)Exactly.\e
MG0030013,"\h(《Vyse》)But, there's still one problem… 
We need to get out of this cell.\e"
MG0030014,"\h(《Gilder》)Leave that to me. 
There was a wire around Willie's leg for a
reason.\e"
MG0030015,\h(《Gilder》)I'll have this door open in no time.\e
MG0030016,"\h(《Vyse》)…Of course!
Heh… is there anything you can't do?\e"
MG0030017,\h(《Vyse》)… What's this?\e
MG0030018,\h(《Gilder》)What's wrong?\e
MG0030019,\h(《Vyse》)There's some writing on the back of this letter.\e
MG0030020,"\h(《Gilder》)Oh…
Well, what does it say?\e"
MG0030021,"\h(《Vyse》)”To my darling Gilder, I will fight for your
freedom as well! For you, my love!”\e"
MG0030022,"\h(《Vyse》)”Your soulmate… Clara”
… and there's lipstick marks at the bottom.\e"
MG0030023,"\h(《Gilder》)Clara?!
She's here, too?!\e"
MG0030024,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, according to this letter… yeah…\e"
MG0030025,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, Vyse…
We don't really need to break out of here,
do we?\e"
MG0030026,\h(《Vyse》)What are you talking about?! We'll be hanged.\e
MG0030027,"\h(《Gilder》)Hm… being hanged… and being stuck with Clara…
tough choice. Ah… oh well…\e"
MG0030028,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow!
I'm impressed…\e"
MG0030029,"\h(《Gilder》)Willy, tell the men to wait for me with a barrel
of loqua! I think I'm gonna need it.\e"
MG0030030,"\h(《Willy》)Aye!
Aye!\e"
MG0030031,"\h(《Gilder》)Well then…
I'll grab our weapons. Let's go!\e"
MG0030032,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… Let's not forget about Aika and Fina. 
I'm not leaving without them.\e"
MG0040000,\h(《Aika》)Vyse!! \e
MG0040001,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey Aika, do you want us to come back later?\e"
MG0040002,\h(《Aika》)Vyse!! Get this creep off of me! \e
MG0040003,"\h(《Vigoro》)Hey, beat it kid! \e"
MG0040004,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry to spoil your fun, but you heard the lady.\e"
MG0040005,\h(《Aika》)Who said this was fun?!\e
MG0040006,\h(《Vigoro》)I am Vigoro.\e
MG0040007,\h(《Vigoro》)No woman in Valua can resist me. \e
MG0040008,"\h(《Vigoro》)I believe that the worth of a man can be
measured by his popularity with the women.\e"
MG0040009,"\h(《Gilder》)Hmm… I kind of like that. I should remember
that for later.\e"
MG0040010,"\h(《Vyse》)Where's Fina?! Give us back the Crystals and
bring Fina here!\e"
MG0040011,"\h(《Vigoro》)Fina?
Oh, the Silvite…\e"
MG0040012,\h(《Vigoro》)Ramirez escorted her to the Royal Palace.\e
MG0040013,"\h(《Aika》)Is that so?
Well, after we beat the snot out of you, 
we'll be rescuing her.\e"
MG0040014,\h(《Vigoro》)I love it when women talk tough.\e
MG0040015,\h(《Vigoro》)Lemme give your friends a lesson in brute force.\e
MG0050000,"\h(《Aika》)Heh…
Looks like you were all talk.\e"
MG0050001,"\h(《Vigoro》)Grr…
Well… you got lucky…\e"
MG0050002,"\h(《Vigoro》)And… and… I didn't have my cannon
or… my… armor.\e"
MG0050003,"\h(《Aika》)On Pirate Isle where I was raised,
we have a saying…\e"
MG0050004,"\h(《Aika》)”A true man never makes excuses for his
shortcomings.”\e"
MG0050005,"\h(《Aika》)And, going by that saying, you've got quite a
ways to go.\e"
MG0050006,"\h(《Vigoro》)Heh…
You've got an attitude… I like that.\e"
MG0050007,\h(《Vigoro》)You'll be seeing me again. You can count on it.\e
MG0060000,"\h(《Enrique》)So, this is where the Air Pirates 
are being held…\e"
MG0060001,"\h(《Guard》)Yes, Prince Enrique.\e"
MG0060002,"\h(《Enrique》)I wish to speak with them. 
Take me to them.\e"
MG0060003,"\h(《Guard》)Sir… perhaps it would be best for you to wait
out here. The cell is… not fitting…
for one of your stature.\e"
MG0060004,"\h(《Guard》)I'll get the other guards.
We will bind the prisoner and bring him to you.\e"
MG0060005,"\h(《Enrique》)Well I'll finally get to meet the Legendary Air
Pirate Vyse. If the rumors that I've heard are
true, he'll look like a demon and spit fire…\e"
MG0060006,"\h(《Enrique》)But, my instincts are telling me that he's
fighting for all the right reasons.\e"
MG0060007,\h(《Guard》)Prince Enrique! It's an emergency!\e
MG0060008,"\h(《Guard》)I found Admiral Vigoro unconscious in 
one of the cells. The rest of the cells 
are empty.\e"
MG0060009,"\h(《Guard》)It appears that Vyse and the others have
escaped!\e"
MG0060010,\h(《Enrique》)What?!\e
MG0060011,"\h(《Enrique》)I see…
(They're trying to escape from the Grand
Fortress again.)\e"
MG0060012,"\h(《Enrique》)Listen carefully. Do not tell anyone about this.
Keep the doors to this area closed. 
Don't let anyone in or out.\e"
MG0060013,"\h(《Enrique》)If you are questioned about it later, tell them 
that it was a direct order from me, understand?\e"
MG0060014,"\h(《Guard》)Yes, Your Majesty! But…\e"
MG0060015,"\h(《Enrique》)Very well, then. Good job. Stay here. 
There's an urgent matter that I must attend to.\e"
M01160000,"\h(《ヴァイス》)ほとんど板みたいな寝台だ。
ふとんも何もない。\c"
M01160001,"\h(《ヴァイス》)これまでも、数多くの人が
この牢獄の、この寝台の上で
息を引きとったんだろうな……\c"
M01160002,"\h(《ヴァイス》)ここから見えるのは
バルアのにごった空だけだ……\c"
M01160003,"\h(《ヴァイス》)寝台は二つあるが……
ファイナはどうしたんだ？\e"
M01160004,"\h(《アイカ》)それが……わかんないのよ。
ここに連れてこられたのは
あたしだけだったし……\e"
M01160005,"\h(《ヴァイス》)俺たちの牢獄と同じベッドだ。
女だからといって
特別サービスはないようだな。\c"
M01160006,"\h(《ヴァイス》)俺たちの牢獄の
ちょうど真上がここなんだな。\c"
M01160007,"\h(《ヴァイス》)……ダメだ、開かない。
カギがかかってるようだ。\c"
M01160008,"\h(　)「要塞砲区のカギ」を使って
　ドアを開けた。\c"
M01160009,"\h(《昇降機のスイッチだ……》)「牢獄区　　　　　２階」
「要塞砲区　２８番砲台」
「乗るのをやめる」\c"
M01160010,"\h(《昇降機のスイッチだ……》)「牢獄区　　　　　１階」
「要塞砲区　２８番砲台」
「乗るのをやめる」\c"
M01160011,"\h(《昇降機のスイッチだ……》)「牢獄区　　１階」
「牢獄区　　２階」
「乗るのをやめる」\c"
M01160012,"\h(《ヴァイス》)……ダメだ、開かない。
「要塞砲区のカギ」でもダメだ。
別のカギじゃないとダメか……\c"
M01160013,"\h(　)「軍港区のカギ」を使って
　ドアを開けた。\c"
M01160014,"\h(《ヴァイス》)くそ、この扉は
ガッチリ閉じられてる上に
カギ穴もないぞ。\e"
M01160015,"\h(《ギルダー》)おそらく、要塞の中枢部へ
通じているんだろうさ。
ここを開けるのはあきらめよう。\c"
M01160016,"\h(《ギルダー》)この扉は、要塞の中枢部へ
通じているんだろうな。
開くのはあきらめたほうがいい。\c"
M01160017,"\h(《ヴァイス》)どうやら、この石板に
何かのタイミングで乗ることで
扉が開くようだな。\c"
M01160018,"\h(《ギルダー》)おっ、ハデにやってるな。
あいつらのおかげで、かなり
要塞内をかくらんできたぜ。\c"
M01160019,"\h(《ヴァイス》)……ん？
スイッチを押しても
反応がないぞ。\e"
M01160020,"\h(《ギルダー》)こりゃ、他の階に
呼ばれてんだな。
隣のやつを使おうぜ。\c"
M01160021,\h(《アイカ》)ぎにゃーっ！\e
M01160022,\h(《ヴァイス》)……今の声は、アイカか!?\c
M01160023,\h(《ビゴロ》)ベイビィ……効いたぜ……\c
M01160024,"\h(　)バルア兵から
「軍港区のカギ」を
奪い取った。\c"
