MK0260000,"\h(《Clara》)Ta-da!
Feast your eyes on this!\e"
MK0260001,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! It looks delicious!
Clara, you're amazing!\e"
MK0260002,"\h(《Gilder》)Well, Fina, it looks like this is going to be a
great party!\e"
MK0260003,"\h(《Fina》)Yes… thank you… all of you. It means so much
to me.\e"
MK0260004,"\h(《Fina》)I… I started off not knowing anything about
this world. But, thanks to all of you, I was
one of the first to sail around it.\e"
MK0260005,"\h(《Aika》)I remember… when you first got here, you didn't
even know what it meant to buy stuff.\e"
MK0260006,"\h(《Gilder》)What?
What kind of crazy place is she from?\e"
MK0260007,"\h(《Aika》)I'm not lying.
She said that they don't use gold at the Great
Silver Shrine.\e"
MK0260008,"\h(《Gilder》)Wow… that's odd.
I don't know if you guys are really advanced… 
or really behind!\e"
MK0260009,"\h(《Fina》)It's not just gold that we don't have…
Flowers… animals… there are so many 
things that I've never seen until I came here.\e"
MK0260010,"\h(《Fina》)In my travels with all of you, I experienced so
much.\e"
MK0260011,"\h(《Fina》)And, one more thing…
I learned something very important while I was 
here…\e"
MK0260012,"\h(《Fina》)When I left the Shrine, the Elders told me, 
”You cannot trust anybody in that world.”\e"
MK0260013,"\h(《Fina》)They said that the people of this world were 
fools who just bickered amongst themselves and 
burned in the flames that they themselves set.\e"
MK0260014,"\h(《Fina》)But, I met so many caring people while I was 
here…\e"
MK0260015,"\h(《Fina》)I learned that even though some try to obtain 
their objectives through war… There are others 
that work together to try and bring peace.\e"
MK0260016,\h(《Fina》)I learned so much… \e
MK0260017,"\h(《Fina》)The memories that we've shared will be the most
valuable treasures I'll ever have.\e"
MK0260018,"\h(《Gilder》)Well then! Tonight, we party until morning!!!\e"
MK0260019,\h(《Everyone》)Yeah!\e
MK0260020,"\h(《》)And so, Fina's farewell party continued merrily
until the morning light.\e"
MK0260021,"\h(《》)Food was shared, tales were told, 
and the bonds of friendship 
were strengthened.\e"
MK0260022,"\h(《》)The first encounter with Fina…
The great escape from Valua…
The search for the Moon Crystals…\e"
MK0260023,"\h(《》)As the memories resurfaced, it seemed as 
if there would be no end to the days 
they would spend traveling together.\e"
MK0260024,\h(《》)And then…\e
MK0260025,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina, what's wrong?
Let's join in the fun!\e"
MK0260026,\h(《Fina》)… Yes… \e
MK0260027,"\h(《Fina》)Tomorrow… I'll have to leave… 
I'll be alone… again.\e"
MK0260028,\h(《Fina》)I… I don't want to leave.\e
MK0260029,"\h(《Fina》)I want… I want to stay here… with all of you.
You all mean so much to me.\e"
MK0260030,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, Fina… I… \e"
MK0260031,\h(《Fina》)Aaahhhhh!!!\e
MK0260032,\h(《Vyse》)What was that!?\e
MK0260033,"\h(《Marco》)Vyse! Vyse! It's an emergency! It's the Armada!
They're here!!!\e"
MK0260034,\h(《Vyse》)The Armada?!\e
