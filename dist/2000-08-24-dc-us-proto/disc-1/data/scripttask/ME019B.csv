M08000000,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)Yo! Come right on in! What can I get for you?
Hrumph.\e"
M08000001,"\h(《What will you do? 》)”Buy and Sell Weapons” 
”Talk about this and that” 
”Leave”\e"
M08000002,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)Tenkou is the name of a gang of outlaws. They go
around seizing weapons, spouting something about
how bare hands are more powerful.\e"
M08000003,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)You say you ran into a Tenkou?
You're lucky you got away without losing your
weapons or your life.\e"
M08000004,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08000005,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)Yo! Come right on in! What can I get for you?
Hrumph.\e"
M08000006,"\h(《What will you do? 》)”Buy and Sell Weapons” 
”Talk about this and that” 
”Leave”\e"
M08000007,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)I don't suppose you folks knew this, but the
chief of the Tenkou gang is one extremely strong
guy.\e"
M08000008,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)You know those two twins you guys defeated? Well
I hear this guy got to be chief by brushing them
aside like a couple of babies.\e"
M08000009,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08000010,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)Yo! Come right on in! What can I get for you?
Hrumph.\e"
M08000011,"\h(《What will you do? 》)”Buy and Sell Weapons” 
”Talk about this and that” 
”Leave”\e"
M08000012,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)So you overpowered that hateful Kangan.
That certainly gets a load off of my chest.
You're a man to be reckoned with! \e"
M08000013,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)Hey, you know what? There's this isolated island
way up north, straight north of here.
I think you should go there.\e"
M08000014,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)I've heard there's a guy living there called
Ryu-kan. He's supposed to be a really phenomenal
swordsmith.\e"
M08000015,"\h(《Weapons Dealer 》)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08010000,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)Well, my, my. What can I do for you?\e"
M08010001,"\h(《What will you do? 》)”Buy and Sell Items” 
”Talk about various things” 
”Leave”  \e"
M08010002,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)The Great Wall that surrounds this island was
built by our ancestors in order to protect the
country.\e"
M08010003,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)But the Great Wall isn't what really protects
us.
What really protects us is the Blue Winds.\e"
M08010004,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)All right, then. Please come again.\e"
M08010005,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)They say a fleet of black steel ships has come,
but there's really nothing to worry about.
Nah, everything's going to be just fine.\e"
M08010006,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)When the time comes, the Blue Winds will blow
and save us. It has protected our country since
ancient times, and it won't fail us now.\e"
M08010007,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)Now I've had a good look at you, you're quite a
handsome fellow, aren't you? If only I were 70
years younger… Oh, my! What am I talking about!\e"
M08010008,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)Look what you've made a poor old woman say, you
naughty little boy, you. My face is scarlet... \e"
M08010009,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)When I was young, everyone was quite taken with
Lord Mikado, but nowadays it's Prince Daigo.\e"
M08010010,"\h(《Elderly Item Merchant 》)Oh, my! Look what you've made a poor old woman
say, you naughty little boy, you.
I'm so embarrassed. My face is burning…\e"
M08030000,"\h(《Urala 》)Oh! Please come in!
What can I get you?\e"
M08030001,"\h(《Aika 》)Looks like they have waitresses in Yafutoma,
too! \e"
M08030002,\h(《Urala 》)Waitr…? \e
M08030003,"\h(《Urala 》)I, I'm sorry.
We don't have anything like that on hand.\e"
M08030004,"\h(《Aika 》)A ha ha ha. You misunderstood!
We were talking about you.\e"
M08030005,\h(《Urala 》)Huh…?\e
M08030006,"\h(《Urala 》)Oh. I, I'm sorry.
I, I thought it was what you wanted to order.\e"
M08030007,"\h(《Aika 》)Don't mention it. We're the ones who should
apologize. We're in a bit of a rush right now,
but we'll come back some other time, okay?\e"
M08030008,"\h(《Urala 》)Al, alright.
Um… Thank you for coming in.\e"
M08030009,"\h(《Urala 》)N, next time you come, be sure to try our
scrumptious dumplings as well as our piping hot
sweetbean soup.\e"
M08030010,"\h(《Vyse 》)… Say,
are you by any chance Kirala's little sister?\e"
M08030011,"\h(《Urala 》)Y, yes… I am.
But why do you ask?\e"
M08030012,"\h(《Aika 》)I thought so!
Actually, Kirala has decided to join the crew of
our ship as a carpenter.\e"
M08030013,"\h(《Aika 》)We're wondering if you might be interested in
joining our crew, too.\e"
M08030014,"\h(《Urala 》)Me? B, but…
unlike my sister, I'm not good for much of
anything besides cooking.\e"
M08030015,"\h(《Vyse 》)Cooking is a perfectly fine skill to have.
How would you like to join our crew as a cook?\e"
M08030016,"\h(《Urala 》)S, sure, okay.
If my sister's joining too.
But are you sure I qualify for the job?\e"
M08030017,"\h(《Vyse 》)Of course you do.
You can make us all kinds of tasty Yafutoman
dishes.\e"
M08030018,"\h(《Urala 》)W, well!
Um… I, I'll really do my best.
Thank you so much.\e"
M08030019,\h(《》)Urala has joined your crew as a ”Cook.”\e
M08030020,"\h(《Urala 》)Um… When you're not busy,
please feel free to drop in any time.\e"
M08030021,"\h(《Urala 》)Oh. You were here the other day, weren't you?
Welcome back.\e"
M08030022,"\h(《Aika 》)Hi! Excuse me,
but would you happen to be Kirala's little
sister by any chance?\e"
M08030023,"\h(《Urala 》)Y, yes… I am.
But why do you ask?\e"
M08030024,"\h(《Aika 》)I thought so!
Actually, Kirala has decided to join the crew of
our ship as a carpenter.\e"
M08030025,"\h(《Aika 》)We're wondering if you might be interested in
joining our crew, too.\e"
M08030026,"\h(《Urala 》)Me? B, but…
unlike my sister, I'm not good for much of

M08030027,"\h(《Vyse 》)Cooking is a perfectly fine skill to have.

M08030028,"\h(《Urala 》)S, sure, okay.

M08030029,"\h(《Vyse 》)Of course you do.
You can make us all kinds of tasty Yafutoman
dishes.\e"
M08030030,"\h(《Urala 》)A, alright!
Um… I, I'll really do my best.
Thank you so much.\e"
M08030031,\h(《》)Urala has joined your crew as a ”Cook.”\e
M08040000,"\h(《Teahouse Owner 》)We serve the best tea and dumplings here, and
thanks to Urala, we've also got the most popular
teahouse in town. \e"
M08040001,"\h(《Teahouse Owner 》)I don't suppose you westlanders can taste the
difference, though.
A hah hah.\e"
M08040002,"\h(《Teahouse Owner 》)Did I hear that a throng of westlanders have
come to town? Sounds like the perfect chance to
spread the word about our tasty dumplings.\e"
M08040003,"\h(《Teahouse Owner 》)Though I don't suppose westlanders have such
discriminating tastebuds as to tell the
difference. A hah hah.\e"
M08040004,"\h(《Teahouse Owner 》)It's a shame we never had a chance to serve the
westlanders our delectable dumplings.
We missed out on a great business opportunity.\e"
M08040005,"\h(《Teahouse Owner 》)If you guys had just taken it a little easier,
we could have had them taste our dumplings.\e"
M08040006,"\h(《Teahouse Owner 》)Now that Urala is leaving here, it feels
like a part of this place is leaving with
her. She brought so much life to this place.\e"
M08040007,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)Without her… this place will feel so empty.
But, she is free to live her own life. I wish
her the best of luck.\c"
M08040008,"\h(《Teahouse Owner 》)Now that Urala is leaving here, it feels
like a part of this place is leaving with
her. She brought so much life to this place.\e"
M08040009,"\h(《Teahouse Owner》)Without her… this place will feel so empty.
But, she is free to live her own life. I wish
her the best of luck.\c"
M08050000,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)That girl Urala who works here is an excellent
cook and seems very domestic, but she's rather
reserved and bashful.\e"
M08050001,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)By contrast, her older sister is the assertive
type, and a very skilled carpenter as well.
They're polar opposites, really.\e"
M08050002,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)If you were to ask which I'd prefer for a wife…
well… it's a really tough choice.\e"
M08050003,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)Would I choose the domestic Urala, or the more
out-going Kirala? I'm afraid I really don't know
how to rank them one over the other.\e"
M08050004,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)What's that?
You say some foreign ships have come into port?
Now hold on just a minute. \e"
M08050005,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)At times like this, you can't let yourself
panic; you have to keep your calm. To wit, it's
best to start by having a quiet cup of tea…\e"
M08050006,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)The truth of the matter is, I'm so flabbergasted
that I've lost my legs.
But don't tell that to Urala. \e"
M08050007,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)Please don't tell Urala that I've lost my legs
and can't stand up.\e"
M08050008,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)What's that?
You chased off the foreign ships?
Well done!\e"
M08050009,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)By the way, stranger.
Please don't tell Urala that I… behaved a
little cowardly…\e"
M08050010,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)I am not surprised that after learning her older
sister, Kirala, would be leaving with you, that
she, too, decided to leave.\e"
M08050011,"\h(《Teahouse Customer》)But to think that two of the most beautiful
women in all of Yafutoma will be leaving at the
same time is very saddening…\c"
M08050012,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)I'm sure that no matter where Urala is, she will
always be able to cook amazing food.\e"
M08050013,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)Urala is very skilled at cooking using a fish
called ”Romuhai fish.” Perhaps you should try
some of her special dishes someday.\c"
M08050014,"\h(《Teahouse Customer 》)Urala is very skilled at cooking using a fish
called ”Romuhai fish.” Perhaps you should try
some of her special dishes someday.\c"
M08100000,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)This land of Yafutoma is a beautiful country of 
countless islands large and small lying beneath 
the Blue Moon. \e"
M08100001,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)Oh, visitor from the distant west! May you taste
our bountiful water and breathe our clear, crisp
air till your heart's content.\e"
M08100002,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)And when you decide to go to Mt. Fuga, please 
make your way to the ship parts dealer located 
down near the waterfront. \e"
M08100003,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)I have already spoken to him about escorting you
folks to Mt. Fuga. \e"
M08100004,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)When you decide to go to Mt. Fuga, please make 
your way to the ship parts dealer located down 
near the waterfront. \e"
M08100005,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)I have already spoken to him about escorting you
folks to Mt. Fuga. \e"
M08100006,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)Ahh, you folks, there! Lord Mikado has been
waiting for you. Please, please. Come right this
way.\c"
M08100007,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)Ahh, you folks, there! I have heard that a fleet
of foreign ships has gathered off shore.
Can you tell me what it is about?\e"
M08100008,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)Ahh, you folks, there! The Divine Wind really 
did blow, did it not? The legend has proved to 
be true!\e"
M08100009,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)Ahh, you folks, there! Take care that you don't 
become a burden to Prince Daigo.\e"
M08110000,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)My apologies. I did not realize that you were
persons whom Lord Mikado wished to see.\e"
M08110001,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)However, since it is my job to protect the state
and restore order, I beg you to overlook any
offense I may have caused. \e"
M08110002,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)I must say, it is quite scandalous how much skin
your apparel leaves exposed. You westlanders
must really be shameless people.\e"
M08110003,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)That is… I mean… perhaps ”shameless” was rather 
too strong of a word. I beg you to overlook any 
offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110004,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)That is… I mean… perhaps ”shameless” was rather 
too strong of a word. I beg you to overlook any 
offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110005,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)Hark! Could that be the Maga Sphere? I never 
would have believed that mere children could 
find it and actually bring it back. \e"
M08110006,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)That is… I mean… I didn't mean that… um… you
are mere children. I beg you to overlook any
offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110007,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)I understand a fleet of black steel ships has 
come into port. I wonder if I can't sneak out 
somehow to go have a look…\e"
M08110008,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)That is… I mean… It was indiscreet of me to
say such a thing. I beg you to overlook any
offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110009,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)Ever since you folks showed up, we've had to
fight off the Tenkou outlaws, then this massive
new island appears out of nowhere…\c"
M08110010,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)And we've had nothing but trouble… I mean, that
is, I'm joking. To put it another way…\e"
M08110011,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)We've had a lot of difficulties, one after
another. But they must have all been good omens,
since Prince Daigo is back with us once again.\c"
M08110012,"\h(《Yafutoma Soldier 》)We've had a lot of difficulties, one after
another. But they must have all been good omens,
since Prince Daigo is back with us once again.\c"
M08170000,"\h(《Thao 》)Come on! Hurry up and get in! You said you'd
practice sailing in this tub ship!\e"
M08170001,"\h(《Thao 》)If you can't even sail a tub ship, you're never
going to be able to help search for Prince
Daigo.\c"
M08170002,"\h(《Thao 》)There's a whole fleet of strange ships in the
harbor. We don't have a chance like this very
often, so let's go see them.\e"
M08170003,"\h(《Thao 》)There's no reason to be afraid. You're not
afraid of the foreigner in the blue suit, are
you?\c"
M08170004,"\h(《Thao 》)Prince Daigo beat up all of the outlaws and came
back home!\e"
M08170005,"\h(《Thao 》)Oh. They say he's putting on some clean clothes.
I sure wish I could hurry up and play with him!\c"
M08170006,"\h(《Thao 》)Anyway, it's about time you at least learned to
sail a tub ship!\c"
M08180000,"\h(《Young Man 》)Hello. You must be one of those westlanders I've
heard about. It's really true that you don't
have black eyes and hair, isn't it?!\e"
M08180001,"\h(《Young Man 》)My dream is to bring lots of westlanders like
you to this country as tourists. \e"
M08180002,"\h(《Young Man 》)I want people from all over the world to see our
picturesque Mt. Fuga.\e"
M08180003,"\h(《Young Man 》)Really! Can there be any sight more picturesque
than this? And just look at what perfect weather
it is today!\e"
M08180004,"\h(《Young Man 》)How I'd like to be able to show this splendid
view to other visitors from your country!\e"
M08180005,"\h(《Young Man 》)A huge fleet of ships, such as I've never seen
before, passed by near hear.\e"
M08180006,"\h(《Young Man 》)I wonder if they could be tourists?
Perhaps the beauty of our fair country is
finally becoming known to the westlanders.\e"
M08180007,"\h(《Young Man 》)Hello. You must be one of those westlanders I've
heard about. It's really true that you don't

M08190000,"\h(《My 》)Nooo! I don't want to practice sailing! I don't
care if I can't sail a tub ship!\e"
M08190001,"\h(《My 》)Prince Daigo will come back home by himself just
fine, even if I don't go searching for him!\c"
M08190002,"\h(《My 》)No, I won't go. I don't care about the foreign
ships.\e"
M08190003,"\h(《My 》)But I'd be too scared! What if the foreigners
kidnapped us and took us away?\c"
M08190004,"\h(《My 》)Prince Daigo finally came home, but now they say
Princess Moegi is going somewhere.\e"
M08190005,"\h(《My 》)I'm going to be so lonesome when the nice
princess goes away. Sniffle sniffle.\c"
M08190006,\h(《My 》)Nooo! I don't care if I can't sail a tub ship!\c
