MA0210000,"\h(《Aika》)We finally made it. 
That wasn't too bad!\e"
MA0210001,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah. But look at the size of that Stone! It'll 
be an adventure and a half just to get that 
thing back outside!\e"
MA0210002,\h(《Aika》)Aaaahh!\e
MA0210003,\h(《Vyse》)Aika!? What's wrong?\e
MA0210004,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse…
Those rocks…
They're… they're moving!\e"
MA0140000,"\h(《Aika》)Whew…
Looks like it won't be getting up anymore.
What was that thing?\e"
MA0140001,"\h(《Vyse》)Some kind of ancient guardian, I think.
Who knows? Okay Aika, we need to hurry up and
secure the Moon Stone.\e"
MA0140002,\h(《Aika》)That's my kind of plan!\e
MA0140003,"\h(《Aika》)Wow…
This Moon Stone is huge!\e"
MA0140004,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah, it was definitely worth going through all 
that trouble. We won't have to worry about fuel 
for a while!\e"
MA0140005,"\h(《Aika》)It's beautiful…
Treasure hunting is definitely my favorite part 
of being an Air Pirate!\e"
MA0140006,\h(《Aika》)Wait till everyone back home sees what we found!\e
MA0140007,\h(《》)You received the ”Moon Stone.”\e
MA0290000,\h(《Vyse》)This is just great… The place is flooded.\e
MA0290001,"\h(《Vyse》)… Aika!
Look! The Moon Stone is at the bottom!\e"
MA0290002,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! It's so bright! 
That Moon Stone must be huge!\e"
MA0290003,"\h(《Aika》)So, Vyse… How do you plan on getting it out of
there? The water is getting pretty deep…\e"
MA0290004,"\h(《What will you do?》)”Swim down to the bottom.”
”Find a way to drain the water.”\e"
MA0290005,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's swim down there to get it.
I think the water is still shallow enough. 
What do you think?\e"
MA0290006,"\h(《Aika》)No way!
You know I can't swim! How am I supposed to help
you carry that thing back up here?!\e"
MA0290007,"\h(《Vyse》)Hahaha… Ever since that one time you fell into
the well when you were a kid, you've been afraid
of the water.\e"
MA0290008,"\h(《Aika》)Besides, I doubt that either of us could swim
while carrying that Moon Stone back to the
surface. It looks way too heavy!\e"
MA0290009,"\h(《Vyse》)… Yeah, you're probably right!\e"
MA0290010,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's try and drain the water from this place.
That way we can just carry the Moon Stone out of
here.\e"
MA0290011,"\h(《Aika》)Well, considering that I can't swim,
I like that plan better… \e"
MA0290012,"\h(《Vyse》)But there's still one problem… how are we
supposed to drain all of this water, anyway?\e"
MA0290013,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, Vyse.
Look over there!\e"
MA0290014,"\h(《Aika》)There's a door over there.
Maybe if we can find a way to open it,
we can drain the water out of this place.\e"
MA0290015,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… You might be right.
We'll use the doors as drains.\e"
MA0290016,"\h(《Aika》)Alright!
Let's go!\e"
M01030000,"\h(《ヴァイス》)ダメだ、ビクともしない。
島と大陸が合体したせいで
外には出られなくなったんだな。\c"
M01030001,"\h(《どうする？》)「出航する」

M01030004,"\h(《ヴァイス》)何だ、こいつの体……
見たこともない、不思議な金属で
できてるぞ。\c"
