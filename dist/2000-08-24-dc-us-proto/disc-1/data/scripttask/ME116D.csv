MC0020000,"\h(《Ramirez》)Lord Galcian. Your Admirals have assembled…
As you have commanded.\e"
MC0020001,\h(《Galcian》)Excellent.\e
MC0020002,"\h(《Galcian》)Admirals of the Valuan Armada…
Let me first offer my gratitude to each of you 
for assembling on such short notice…\e"
MC0020003,"\h(《Galcian》)Let it be known that we have successfully 
captured a citizen of the Silver Civilization, 
as Empress Teodora requested.\e"
MC0020004,\h(《Old Admiral》)What?! How?!\e
MC0020005,"\h(《Large Admiral》)So, we've finally captured one…
Who accomplished this?\e"
MC0020006,"\h(《Alfonso》)Hah hah hah…
Of course, I was the one to find her first…\e"
MC0020007,"\h(《Alfonso》)I crippled her ship and captured her. But I was 
betrayed by my own Vice Captain and she was 
taken from me…\e"
MC0020008,"\h(《Gregorio》)I'm sure Empress Teodora is very pleased that 
she was recovered.\e"
MC0020009,"\h(《Gregorio》)Now, if we can persuade her to give us the 
information we need, it would be worth all of 
the effort we spent tracking her down.\e"
MC0020010,"\h(《Vigoro》)You said that the citizen of the Silver 
Civilization that you found was a woman?! Now 
THAT'S something worth getting excited over.\e"
MC0020011,"\h(《Vigoro》)How old is she?  Is she good looking? 
Does she wear leather?
I like my women wild and crazy!\e"
MC0020012,"\h(《Belleza》)You're out of luck, Vigoro.
The girl is the exact opposite. 
She's very shy and demure.\e"
MC0020013,"\h(《Belleza》)Her name is Fina.
She is currently being escorted to see Empress 
Teodora in the Imperial Palace.\e"
MC0020014,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehehehe…
Very good, Admiral Belleza. I see that you are 
our espionage expert for good reasons.\e"
MC0020015,"\h(《De Loco》)Of course, being the head of weapon development,
I have a deeply vested interest in the 
technology of the Silver Civilization! Hehehe!\e"
MC0020016,"\h(《Galcian》)I will head back to the Imperial Palace and 
await Empress Teodora's orders to commence the 
search for the Moon Crystals.\e"
MC0020017,"\h(《Galcian》)Fina, our new… ally, shall aid us in gathering 
all six of the Crystals from around the world.\e"
MC0020018,\h(《Galcian》)… As for you… Alfonso.\e
MC0020019,"\h(《Galcian》)You lied in your report.
And as punishment, you are now relieved of your
position as Commander of the Ocean Fleet.\e"
MC0020020,"\h(《Galcian》)And for an indefinite period of time, you shall
be confined to Ixa'taka.\e"
MC0020021,"\h(《Alfonso》)Y… you think that I lied in my report, sire?
Ha… haha… w… what are you talking about?\e"
MC0020022,"\h(《Galcian》)You were attacked by the Air Pirates and you 
deserted your crew and your ship to save 
yourself.\e"
MC0020023,"\h(《Galcian》)Your ship and your crew were released by the Air
Pirates and returned recently. 
They filed a full… and ACCURATE… report.\e"
MC0020024,\h(《Alfonso》)Bah…\e
MC0020025,"\h(《Galcian》)Our Armada is invincible.
Showing any signs of weakness is unforgivable. 
I trust that you will not forget that.\e"
MC0020026,"\h(《Galcian》)This meeting is over.
I want all of you to be ready to depart at a
moment's notice.\e"
MC0020027,"\h(《Valuan Admirals》)Yes, Lord Galcian!\e"
MG0080000,\h(《Fina》)Ramirez…\e
MG0080001,\h(《Ramirez》)……\e
MG0080002,"\h(《Fina》)Ramirez… why?
Why are you fighting for the Valuans?\e"
MG0080003,"\h(《Fina》)What about our orders? 
What about the Elders?\e"
MG0080004,\h(《Ramirez》)……\e
MG0080005,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Lord Ramirez, it's an emergency!!\e"
MG0080006,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)One of our cannons exploded and the entire deck
is on fire. But no enemy shells hit that area.\e"
MG0080007,"\h(《Ramirez》)Find out the cause of the fire and report back
to me. In the meantime, stop firing and set the
fortress in defensive mode.\e"
MG0080008,"\h(《Ramirez》)There are only two or three ships attacking. 
Their effect on the wall will be minimal.\e"
MG0080009,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Yes, sir!\e"
MG0080010,"\h(《Ramirez》)I fight for Lord Galcian. 
That is all you need to know.\e"
MG0080011,\h(《Fina》)Ramirez…\e
MG0090000,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina! 
We came to get you out of here.\e"
MG0090001,\h(《Fina》)Vyse!\e
MG0090002,"\h(《Vyse》)We got here as soon as we found out where you
were. Are you okay?\e"
MG0090003,"\h(《Fina》)Yes… I am… 
Thank you…\e"
MG0090004,"\h(《Fina》)It's strange…
The first time you rescued me from
the train, I was really surprised to see you.\e"
MG0090005,"\h(《Fina》)But this time, I knew that you would come for
me. I knew you would find me.\e"
MG0090006,"\h(《Vyse》)Hahaha…
Oh Fina, after all we've been through together…\e"
MG0090007,"\h(《Vyse》)I swear on my oath as a Blue Rogue that I will
do everything in my power to keep you safe.\e"
MG0090008,\h(《Fina》)… I know…\e
MG0090009,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh…
Good one, Vyse, I didn't know you were so 
smooth with the ladies.\e"
MG0090010,"\h(《Gilder》)Getting jealous, Aika? I bet you wish that Vyse
would say stuff like that to you.\e"
MG0090011,"\h(《Aika》)I don't need to hear him say those things.
I know he would do the same for me.\e"
MG0090012,"\h(《Aika》)Whenever I'm in trouble, I have faith that Vyse
will always be there to save me. He already
saved me once today.\e"
MG0090013,\h(《Gilder》)Heh… Good point.\e
MG0090014,"\h(《Gilder》)Can we save the mushy stuff for later? We just
broke out of prison, and we're still in Valua.\e"
MG0090015,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright.
But, how exactly are we going to get out of
here?\e"
MG0090016,"\h(《Gilder》)Well, since we're in the Grand Fortress, there
should be Valuan ships docked all over the
place. We can borrow one of those.\e"
MG0090017,"\h(《Gilder》)We should be able to reach the docks from the
bottom floors of the fortress. We'll have to
backtrack a little, but we should be okay.\e"
MG0090018,"\h(《Vyse》)So, we'll take the elevator back down and look
for a ship. Alright! Let's go!\e"
MG0090019,\h(《》)Fina has joined your party.\e
MG0320000,"\h(《Vyse》)…Huh? I can hear someone talking on the other
side of this door.\e"
MG0320001,"\h(《Ramirez》)Everyone, remain calm.
The Grand Fortress isn't about to crumble under
the firepower of a few ships.\e"
MG0320002,"\h(《Ramirez》)Anyone who deserts their post will have to deal
with me personally.\e"
MG0320003,\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Yes Admiral Ramirez!\e
MG0320004,"\h(《Ramirez》)I will go investigate the cause of the 
explosion. Two of you stay here and 
guard the girl. The rest of you, follow me.\e"
MG0320005,\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Yes!!!\e
M01160000,"\h(《ヴァイス》)ほとんど板みたいな寝台だ。
ふとんも何もない。\c"
M01160001,"\h(《ヴァイス》)これまでも、数多くの人が
この牢獄の、この寝台の上で
息を引きとったんだろうな……\c"
M01160002,"\h(《ヴァイス》)ここから見えるのは
バルアのにごった空だけだ……\c"
M01160003,"\h(《ヴァイス》)寝台は二つあるが……
ファイナはどうしたんだ？\e"
M01160004,"\h(《アイカ》)それが……わかんないのよ。
ここに連れてこられたのは
あたしだけだったし……\e"
M01160005,"\h(《ヴァイス》)俺たちの牢獄と同じベッドだ。
女だからといって
特別サービスはないようだな。\c"
M01160006,"\h(《ヴァイス》)俺たちの牢獄の
ちょうど真上がここなんだな。\c"
M01160007,"\h(《ヴァイス》)……ダメだ、開かない。
カギがかかってるようだ。\c"
M01160008,"\h(　)「要塞砲区のカギ」を使って
　ドアを開けた。\c"
M01160009,"\h(《昇降機のスイッチだ……》)「牢獄区　　　　　２階」
「要塞砲区　２８番砲台」

M01160011,"\h(《昇降機のスイッチだ……》)「牢獄区　　１階」
「牢獄区　　２階」
「乗るのをやめる」\c"
M01160012,"\h(《ヴァイス》)……ダメだ、開かない。
「要塞砲区のカギ」でもダメだ。
別のカギじゃないとダメか……\c"
M01160013,"\h(　)「軍港区のカギ」を使って
　ドアを開けた。\c"
M01160014,"\h(《ヴァイス》)くそ、この扉は
ガッチリ閉じられてる上に
カギ穴もないぞ。\e"
M01160015,"\h(《ギルダー》)おそらく、要塞の中枢部へ
通じているんだろうさ。
ここを開けるのはあきらめよう。\c"
M01160016,"\h(《ギルダー》)この扉は、要塞の中枢部へ
通じているんだろうな。
開くのはあきらめたほうがいい。\c"
M01160017,"\h(《ヴァイス》)どうやら、この石板に
何かのタイミングで乗ることで
扉が開くようだな。\c"
M01160018,"\h(《ギルダー》)おっ、ハデにやってるな。
あいつらのおかげで、かなり
要塞内をかくらんできたぜ。\c"
M01160019,"\h(《ヴァイス》)……ん？
スイッチを押しても
反応がないぞ。\e"
M01160020,"\h(《ギルダー》)こりゃ、他の階に
呼ばれてんだな。
隣のやつを使おうぜ。\c"
M01160021,\h(《アイカ》)ぎにゃーっ！\e
M01160022,\h(《ヴァイス》)……今の声は、アイカか!?\c
