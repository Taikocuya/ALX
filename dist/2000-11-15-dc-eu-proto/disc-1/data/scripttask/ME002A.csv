MA0090000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey Fina.
How are you feeling?\e"
MA0090001,"\h(«Fina»)I'm feeling much better.
Thank you for your concern.\e"
MA0090002,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… no problem. I'm just happy
to see that you're well.
Looks like we'll be reaching the island soon.\e"
MA0090003,\h(«Fina»)… Island?\e
MA0090004,"\h(«Vyse»)You can see it right over there.
That's our base… Pirate Isle.\e"
MA0090005,\h(«Fina»)Pirate Isle…\e
MA0130000,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse!
Vy~se!\e"
MA0130001,"\h(«Aika»)Good morning!
We're going to Shrine Island today, right?\e"
MA0130002,\h(«Vyse»)Yeah… I'll be right down. Give me a second.\e
MA0130003,"\h(«Aika»)Good morning, Fina!
Did you sleep well?\e"
MA0130004,\h(«Fina»)Yes. Thank you.\e
MA0130005,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina, we'll be heading over to Shrine Island in 
a few minutes to get that Moon Stone. You can 
stay here and relax at my place if you want.\e"
MA0130007,\h(«Fina»)That's fine. Thank you.\e
MA0130008,"\h(«Aika»)Alright Vyse, let's get going.
The boat is on the upper dock, 
and it's ready to go!\e"
MA0150000,"\h(«Ben the Lookout»)Ahhh…
It looks like it's going to be another nice day
today. Not too windy…\e"
MA0150001,"\h(«Ben the Lookout»)Well, there's the bell…
Time to get to work…\e"
MA0150002,\h(«Ben the Lookout»)I gotta loosen up a little.\e
MA0150003,\h(«Ben the Lookout»)Huh?\e
MA0150004,\h(«Ben the Lookout»)Oh… oh no!\e
MA0150005,"\h(«Ben the Lookout»)Ships!!! Ships approaching!
From the North-Northwest…
distance: 1.5 leagues!\e"
MA0150006,"\h(«Ben the Lookout»)It's the Imperial Armada!!!
They've got a full battle squadron!
They're in attack formation!!!\e"
MA0150007,"\h(«Dyne»)Everyone get underground! 
Women and children first!
Hurry!\e"
MA0150008,"\h(«Dyne»)Damn…
I never thought they'd find us…\e"
MA0150009,"\h(«Dyne»)…!
That flag… 
It's Galcian's Flagship!\e"
MA0150010,"\h(«Ramirez»)Lord Galcian.
We've blasted the island with cannon fire and 
our troops have begun the invasion.\e"
MA0150011,"\h(«Galcian»)Good…
They seem very organized for a small village 
that is under siege.\e"
MA0150012,"\h(«Galcian»)I don't know who their leader is, but he
seems very capable. Perhaps Alfonso was in
over his head.\e"
MA0150013,\h(«Ramirez»)…Perhaps.\e
MA0150014,"\h(«Galcian»)No matter, it appears the battle is over.
Retrieve the girl and bring her to me.\e"
MA0150015,"\h(«Galcian»)Capture the Air Pirates. We'll need to 
interrogate them when we return to Valua.
And be sure to destroy their ship as well…\e"
MA0150016,"\h(«Ramirez»)And if they resist, Lord Galcian? 
What does Your Excellency wish me to do if the 
situation arises?\e"
MA0150017,"\h(«Galcian»)I don't think they're foolish enough to resist. 
However, if something should happen…\e"
MA0150018,"\h(«Galcian»)Burn the village and kill them all. Let the 
bodies rot in the sun and leave one of our flags
to set an example for others who may defy us.\e"
MA0200000,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Oh! Welcome back, Vyse.\e"
MA0200001,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)So, you're Fina. It's very nice to meet you.\e"
MA0200002,"\h(«Fina»)The pleasure is all mine.
I… I hope I am not intruding…\e"
MA0200003,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Oh, don't be silly! It's been a long time since 
we've had guests.\e"
MA0200004,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Well, I have to finish cooking dinner. Go 
outside and have some fun. I'll call you when 
it's ready.\e"
MA0200005,\h(«Aika»)Hey guys!\e
MA0200006,"\h(«Aika»)Sorry to have kept you waiting!
I was just fixing my hair.\e"
MA0200007,"\h(«Aika»)Hey… the sunset outside is beautiful. 
Why don't we go outside and check it out?\e"
MA0200008,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, we still have some time before dinner… 
why not?\e"
MA0200009,"\h(«Aika»)Okay, great!
Come on! We can get a great view from up top on 
Lookout Island.\e"
MA0250000,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, go on ahead.
I have to stop by my house for a second.\e"
MA0250001,\h(«Vyse»)Why? What's wrong?\e
MA0250002,"\h(«Aika»)I just want to freshen up.
Don't worry, I'll catch up with you guys in a 
few minutes! See you at your house!\e"
MA0260000,\h(«Vyse»)I wonder what this handkerchief is for?\e
MA0260001,"\h(«Vyse»)…Oh.
I think there's something underneath it.\e"
MA0260002,"\h(«Vyse»)(Oops… the handkerchief was there to cover this
hole in Aika's room…)\e"
MA0260003,\h(«Aika»)…?\e
MA0260004,"\h(«Aika»)Aaahhh!
Who's there?! 
Take that, you creep!\e"
MA0260005,"\h(«Vyse»)Ow!
My eye!\e"
MA0260006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse!
What are you doing!? 
Peeking into my room…!?\e"
MA0260007,"\h(«Aika»)You should be ashamed of yourself! 
I can't believe that you would spy on me like
that! Get out of here!\e"
MA0260008,"\h(«Vyse»)But… but… I was just looking under this
handkerchief! I didn't know! You probably just
put it there to draw people's attention…\e"
MA0280000,"\h(«Aika»)Good morning, Fina!
Did you sleep well?\e"
MA0280001,\h(«Fina»)Yes. Thank you.\e
MA0280002,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina, we'll be heading over to Shrine Island to 
get that Moon Stone in a few minutes. You can 
stay here and relax at my place if you want.\e"
MA0280003,\h(«Fina»)That will be fine. Thank you.\e
MA0280004,"\h(«Aika»)Alright Vyse, let's get going.
The boat is on the upper dock, 
and it's ready to go!\e"
Ms002a000,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a small supply box. There is usually all
sorts of fishing and sailing equipment piled up
in here, but it's empty right now.\c"
Ms002a001,"\h(«Vyse»)That reminds me, my mom used to tell me stories
about these butterflies that migrate across
great distances just to eat or something.\c"
Ms002a002,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a bag full of Moon Stones. I think these
are going to be loaded onto the ship. They're
probably going to be used as fuel.\c"
Ms002a003,"\h(«Vyse»)We use this windmill as a power source to raise
and lower heavy cargo in and out of our ship
in the underground port.\e"
Ms002a004,"\h(«Vyse»)While they aren't necessarily rare, we try to
conserve Moon Stones whenever we can. So, we use
wind power for some things instead.\c"
Ms002a005,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a box full of bullets. My father is really
the only one that uses a gun around here. I
prefer using cutlasses.\c"
Ms002a006,"\h(«Vyse»)We use this windmill as a power source to raise
and lower heavy cargo in and out of our ship
in the underground port.\e"
Ms002a007,"\h(«Vyse»)While they aren't necessarily rare, we try to
conserve Moon Stones whenever we can. So, we use
wind power for some things instead.\c"
Ms002a008,"\h(«Vyse»)This fireplace seems well used. Wait… is that
gunpowder I smell? Geez… Aika probably throws
gunpowder in this thing for fun. She's crazy…\c"
Ms002a009,"\h(«Vyse»)Wait a second there… I may be an Air Pirate,
but I am a gentleman. I refuse to look through
a lady's dresser without permission.\c"
Ms002a010,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… This is that ragged, old doll that Aika
used to carry around when she was a kid. I
guess she still has it.\c"
Ms002a011,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this? I didn't know Aika had a vanity.
I guess even she can be feminine at times.\c"
Ms002a012,"\h(«Vyse»)Both of Aika's parents passed away when we
were still little kids.\e"
Ms002a013,"\h(«Vyse»)So, there's only one bed here in her place.
She tosses and turns in her sleep a lot, so
she needs a rather large bed.\c"
Ms002a014,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a shield from an old Valuan battleship
raid. Shields are too cumbersome to be useful
for us, so we just use it as decoration.\c"
Ms002a015,"\h(«Vyse»)Spears can be really useful when raiding wooden
ships. All you have to do is light the tip on
fire and it can cause a lot of damage.\c"
Ms002a016,"\h(«Vyse»)We use this pillar to practice punching and
kicking. A lot of raids break out into melees,
so we all need to know how to fight.\c"
Ms002a017,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, I may be an Air Pirate, but I would never
steal from an old lady's dresser.\c"
Ms002a018,"\h(«Vyse»)This smell…
Oh man, this has to be salted fish.
I regret even looking in here…\c"
Ms002a019,"\h(«Vyse»)Granny used to cook bread in this fireplace for
me and Aika all the time when we were kids. She
really does make the best bread.\e"
Ms002a020,"\h(«Vyse»)But, ever since Lindsi, Alan, and Jimmy were
born, they get to eat everything that Granny
makes.\c"
Ms002a021,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this…?
Yuck!!! It's her denture cleaning solution!\c"
Ms002a022,"\h(«Vyse»)It's full of fresh water. I wonder who left it
here…\c"
Ms002a023,"\h(«Vyse»)The jar is filled with pickled turnips. Every
time I smell turnips, I always think of
sailing… That's all we ever eat out there…\c"
Ms002a024,"\h(«Vyse»)It's filled with all sorts of tableware.
There's even some smaller utensils. It's
probably for the little kids.\c"
Ms002a025,"\h(«Vyse»)It's just a fireplace. I remember many times as
a kid warming myself to a fire here, after being
outside all day during the cold season.\c"
Ms002a026,"\h(«Vyse»)A water jar used for cooking. We all get our
water from the well, so we need containers to
store the water before we use it.\c"
Ms002a027,"\h(«Vyse»)A bandana… a striped shirt… It's filled with
old, worn out clothes. Some people just get
attached to their stuff, I guess…\c"
Ms002a028,"\h(«Vyse»)After returning from a long voyage, there's
nothing quite like collapsing in your own bed.
It's the best feeling in the world.\c"
Ms002a029,"\h(«Vyse»)My old man is always out sailing, so his bed
isn't very worn in. It looks almost brand new.\c"
Ms002a030,"\h(«Vyse»)This is our fireplace. Mom uses it daily to cook
for herself… and for us when we're actually
home and not out sailing.\c"
Ms002a031,"\h(«Vyse»)It's my bed. But, I've been out sailing with my
dad a lot lately, so I really only sleep in it
on occasion.\c"
Ms002a032,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a book that we picked up on one of our
raids. Books are really hard to come by, so
they're one of our most treasured finds.\e"
Ms002a033,"\h(«Vyse»)I once read a book on the art of navigation over
and over again until the bindings were all worn 
out. I hope the knowledge will come in handy…\c"
Ms002a034,"\h(«Vyse»)Oops… I left my papers all over the place. I'm
surprised Mom didn't get on my case about the
mess that I left.\e"
Ms002a035,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, I was only studying about the stars. She
should be happy that I'm not just sitting around
doing nothing, I suppose.\c"
Ms002a036,"\h(«Vyse»)It says “Windmill Island.” That's what this
island is called on most maps. But, nobody that
lives here actually calls it by that name.\e"
Ms002a037,"\h(«Vyse»)This place's real name is “Pirate Isle.” We only
use Windmill Island as a cover name to avoid
getting caught by the Valuan Empire.\c"
Ms002a038,"\h(«Vyse»)This is our well. It's very valuable to us here
on Pirate Isle. Actually, one time when we were
still kids, Aika fell inside the well…\c"
Ms002a039,"\h(«Vyse»)The ladies of the town often use these boxes to
sit and rest on while drawing water from the
well. It's sort of the town gossip area.\c"
Ms002a040,"\h(«Vyse»)With the way she acts, you would never guess
that Aika has the tenderness to raise delicate
flowers like this…\e"
Ms002a041,"\h(«Vyse»)But, I guess I'm just rough on her because I've
known her for so long. She's really a sweet
girl… A little rough around the edges, though…\c"
Ms002a042,"\h(«Vyse»)There's always a steady breeze that blows
through this region, so our laundry dries
really quickly.\c"
Ms002a043,"\h(«Vyse»)There's always a steady breeze that blows
through this region, so our laundry dries
really quickly.\c"
Ms002a044,"\h(«Vyse»)Isn't this the laundry tub?
Who left it just sitting out here like this?\c"
Ms002a052,\h( )“Please do not step on the garden.”\e
Ms002a045,"\h(«Vyse»)… Vegetables are an important source of
nutrients for sailors. Everyone takes great care
to make sure and grow them properly.\c"
Ms002a046,"\h(«Vyse»)This is our incinerator. It's connected to the
fireplace inside. That way, they both can use
the same chimney.\c"
Ms002a047,"\h(«Vyse»)It's easy to get scurvy when you're always out
sailing. It's hard to get enough vegetables, so
that's why pickled turnips are so important.\c"
Ms002a048,"\h(«Vyse»)It's locked. Well, it's still pretty early, so
everyone's probably still sleeping.\c"
Ms002a049,"\h(«Vyse»)The door is locked. I probably shouldn't wake
anyone up, so I'll just leave them alone.\c"
Ms002a050,"\h(«Vyse»)Wait… didn't Aika say she was going back to her
house? Then why is the door locked?\c"
Ms002a051,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse!!
Go away!! I'm busy right now!!
Can't you leave me alone just for one second?!\c"
Ms002a053,"\h(«Vyse»)I swear… How can she expect me not to notice
this hole if she has this brightly colored
handkerchief covering it?\c"
Ms002a054,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, what's this handkerchief for?\e"
Ms002a055,"\h(«Aika»)Hehe… Actually, there's a hole in the wall. I
figured you'd probably try and peek inside, so
I covered it up.\c"
Ms002a056,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Depart for Shrine Island.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
M00010000,"\h(«Jimmy»)Hey Vyse!
We're playing hide-and-seek!
You wanna play with us?\e"
M00010001,"\h(«Jimmy»)If you can find all three of us and Pow,
I'll tell you a secret!\e"
M00010002,"\h(«What will you do?»)“All right, I'll play.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M00010003,"\h(«Vyse»)Hide-and-seek, huh?
All right, I'll play.\e"
M00010004,"\h(«Jimmy»)Ya-a-ay!
Alright, you're “it,” then!\e"
M00010005,"\h(«Jimmy»)When we say we're ready, you have to come and
look for the three of us and Pow.\c"
M00010017,\h(«Jimmy»)Alright! We're ready! Come and find us!!!\c
M00010006,"\h(«Vyse»)Sorry, but I'm kind of busy right now.
Maybe some other time.\e"
M00010007,"\h(«Jimmy»)Too bad… See you later, then!\c"
M00010008,"\h(«Jimmy»)I can't believe you already found me!
I thought I had the perfect hiding place…\e"
M00010009,"\h(«Jimmy»)But if you don't find all of us, we still win!!\e"
M00010010,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright, that's everyone. I win.\e"
M00010011,"\h(«Jimmy»)I can't believe you found us all!
Oh well… a promise is a promise.
I'll tell you a little secret.\e"
M00010012,"\h(«Jimmy»)You know the bookshelf in Captain Dyne's room?
I think that there's some sort of secret to it!\e"
M00010013,"\h(«Jimmy»)I was looking for a book in there one day and
when I leaned on the book shelf, it sorta moved
a little funny. Maybe you should check it out!\c"
M00010014,"\h(«Jimmy»)If you don't find all of us, we still win!\c"
M00010015,"\h(«Jimmy»)You know the bookshelf in Captain Dyne's room?
I think that there's some sort of secret to it!\e"
M00010016,"\h(«Jimmy»)I was looking for a book in there one day and
when I leaned on the book shelf, it sorta moved
a little funny. Maybe you should check it out!\c"
M00020000,"\h(«Alan»)Vyse, whenever I go sailing on a ship, I always
get sick… and sometimes I even throw up.\e"
M00020001,\h(«Alan»)Does that mean I can't become a sailor?\e
M00020002,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Sure you can be a sailor!”
“Sorry, Alan…”\e"
M00020003,"\h(«Vyse»)Sure you can be a sailor! I used to get
airsick all the time when I was little.\e"
M00020004,"\h(«Vyse»)And after a while, you just sorta stop
throwing up. Your body gets used to it.\e"
M00020005,"\h(«Alan»)Okay! I'll do my best! I'll throw up however
many times it takes until I can become a sailor!\c"
M00020006,"\h(«Vyse»)Sorry, Alan… but you might not be cut out for
sailing. But hey, there's no reason you have to
become a sailor if it doesn't agree with you.\e"
M00020007,"\h(«Vyse»)You can build houses instead, or work in the
harbor… There're lots of fine, respectable
jobs that you can do on land!\e"
M00020008,"\h(«Alan»)Yeah, you're right! Thanks, Vyse.
I'll do my best to find what I'm good at!\c"
M00020009,"\h(«Alan»)Okay! I'll do my best! I'll throw up however
many times it takes until I can become a sailor!\c"
M00020010,"\h(«Alan»)I'll do my best to find what I'm good at, Vyse!\c"
M00020011,"\h(«Alan»)Oh no! You found me! I was
sure I'd be safe here.\c"
M00020012,\h(«Alan»)I wonder where the others are hiding?\c
M00020013,"\h(«Alan»)You should come and play with us more
often, okay Vyse?\c"
M00020014,"\h(«Alan»)We've been out here playing for so long… I'm
so hungry now. I wonder what's for dinner
tonight?\c"
M00020015,"\h(«Alan»)You're heading out to go get those Moon Stones
that fell yesterday, right? Good luck!\c"
M00030000,"\h(«Lindsi»)Oh! Vyse, you're back! Welcome home!\e"
M00030001,"\h(«Lindsi»)We're all playing hide-and-seek with Pow!
You should play with us, too!\c"
M00030002,"\h(«Lindsi»)Come on, Vyse. You should play with us, too!\c"
M00030003,"\h(«Lindsi»)Oh no! You found me! I knew I
should've hidden somewhere else!\c"
M00030004,"\h(«Lindsi»)You haven't found everyone yet, right?
Don't give up!\c"
M00030005,"\h(«Lindsi»)That was fun! You should play with
us again sometime, okay Vyse?!\c"
M00030006,"\h(«Lindsi»)It's getting late… I should go home soon.
My mommy told me to be home before dark.\c"
M00030007,"\h(«Lindsi»)You're going out to look for Moon Stones? I wish
I could go with you! It sounds like so much fun!\c"
M00040000,"\h(«Pow»)Pow pow, pow!\e"
M00040001,"\h(«Fina»)O, oh my!\e"
M00040002,"\h(«Vyse»)Quiet, Pow! I told you not to bark
at guests before, right!\e"
M00040003,\h(«Pow»)Pow… pow…\e
M00040004,"\h(«Fina»)I, I'm sorry. He just took me by surprise.
He's actually really cute…\e"
M00040005,"\h(«Fina»)I guess on your island, you live
with other animals…\e"
M00040006,"\h(«Vyse»)Um… yeah. I, I guess. You don't have pets
where you come from?\e"
M00040007,"\h(«Fina»)W, well, um… no. Not really. Is it that
unusual? I'm so sorry… It's just that
everything seems so… different here.\c"
M00040008,\h(«Pow»)Pow! Pow!\c
M00040009,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!\c
M00040010,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh, there you are, Pow. Next time,
you should hide in a better place, okay?\e"
M00040011,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!\c
M00040012,"\h(«Vyse»)Wait here, Pow. I'm going to
go find all of the others.\e"
M00040013,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow pow!\c
M00040014,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow pow!\c
M00050000,"\h(«Martha»)Oh, hey there, Vyse. I heard that you guys
rescued a girl from the Valuans?\e"
M00050001,\h(«Vyse»)Yup. Let me introduce you to her…\e
M00050002,"\h(«Fina»)Hello, it's very nice to meet you. My name is
Fina. I, I'm very grateful for all the
hospitality everyone has been showing me…\e"
M00050003,"\h(«Marth»)Well, well… aren't you just the sweetest little
thing? Well, Fina, it's our pleasure. Just relax
and make yourself at home, okay?\e"
M00050004,"\h(«Martha»)Hehe… Nice catch, Vyse. I guess your work has
its perks, huh?\c"
M00050005,"\h(«Martha»)Those Valuans must be a bunch of dirty
scoundrels to go chasing after such a
sweet girl like her.\c"
M00050006,"\h(«Martha»)Heh… That good-for-nothing husband of mine just
came home from another voyage today and where is
he now? At the tavern. I swear…\c"
M00050007,"\h(«Martha»)You kids are going to go looking for Moon
Stones? Well, bring back plenty… We'll
need them to keep warm during the cold season.\c"
M00060000,"\h(«Barbara»)It's every Air Pirate's dream to be a
“Swashbuckler.” But you have to do more
than sail to become one.\e"
M00060001,"\h(«Barbara»)You have to live as one… in both your actions
and your words. Only true Swashbucklers can
become great leaders.\c"
M00060002,"\h(«Barbara»)You have to live as one… in both your actions
and your words. Only true Swashbucklers can
become great leaders.\c"
M00060003,"\h(«Barbara»)Now, let me see… What shall I make for
dinner today?\c"
M00070000,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Hey there, Vyse. It's nice to be home again,
huh? Sometimes when we're out sailing for a
long time, I start to miss this old place.\e"
M00070001,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Aboard ship ain't bad either, but you really
have to come back to the island now and then
or your legs forget what solid ground is like.\c"
M00070002,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)The breeze here on the island is gentle and
cool. My whole body feels refreshed.\c"
M00070003,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Hey, Vyse. I hear you're going to Shrine Island
to pick up Moon Stones.\e"
M00070004,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)To get to Shrine Island, you need to sail
straight north of here. But, be careful…
there're all sorts of monsters out there.\e"
M00070005,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)One more thing… Not only are there Moon Stones
in this world, there are things called
“Moonberries.” They contain a lot of power.\e"
M00070006,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)By eating some, you will actually get stronger.
If you go to your status screen and select
“Super Moves,” you can learn new techniques.\c"
M00080000,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)I'm cooking dinner right now, so perhaps you
could go for a walk or something.\e"
M00080001,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Vyse, if you're going to Shrine Island, I want
you to take this with you. I've included enough
for both you and Aika.\e"
M00080002,\h( )You received 2 “Sacres Crystals.”\e
M00080003,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)If you ever need to take a break, don't be
afraid to come back home and rest up. You
shouldn't push yourself too hard.\c"
M00080004,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Vyse, why don't you take a little rest? You
must be very tired. A little nap can work
wonders sometimes…\e"
M00080005,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Sure, I could use a little rest.”
“Nah… I'll be fine. I'm not that tired.”\e"
M00080006,"\h(«Vyse»)Sure, I could use a little rest. I was starting
to get a little tired…\e"
M00080007,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)No problem.
Sleep well, Vyse.\e"
M00080008,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)It looks like you rested well.
Be careful out there, okay?\c"
M00080009,"\h(«Vyse»)I'll be fine, mom. I'm not that tired.\e"
M00080010,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)I see. Well, just be careful out there, okay?\c"
M00090000,"\h(«Jessica»)Everyone needs a place to go home to. Especially
sailors. It's always good to have a place to
rest their tired wings, you know?\e"
M00090001,"\h(«Jessica»)When you know that you have someone to go home
to and a warm bed waiting for you, it gives a
person a little extra strength, I suppose…\c"
M00100000,"\h(«Granny»)We're able to live the way we do,
thanks to the blessed Moons.\e"
M00100001,"\h(«Granny»)The Moons provide us with Moon Stones that keep
our ships flying and provide us with fuel for
fires to keep ourselves warm.\e"
M00100002,\h(«Granny»)We truly are blessed…\c
M00100003,\h(«Granny»)We truly are blessed…\c
M00100004,"\h(«Granny»)I hear that the Silver Moon has blessed us
again with gifts from the skies.\e"
M00100005,\h(«Granny»)We truly are blessed…\c
M00110000,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)Hey there, Vyse! Would you like me to give you
a few pointers on hand-to-hand combat?\e"
M00110001,"\h(«What will you ask about?»)“Ask about combat tactics.”
“Ask about weapons.”
“No, it's okay.”\e"
M00110002,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, could you teach me some combat
tactics? I think I need a few pointers…\e"
M00110003,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)Okay! Well, the first thing you need to learn
how to use effectively in battle, is your
party's “Spirit.”\e"
M00110004,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)You can think of “Spirit” as your entire party's
fighting energy. You use it up whenever you cast
spells or use “Super Moves.”\e"
M00110005,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)During a battle, everyone in your group uses the
same pool of Spirit Points.\e"
M00110006,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)That means that you can have someone like…
let's say, Aika, for instance… “Focus” and gain
Spirit Points for the rest of the party.\e"
M00110007,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)… And then you, Vyse, can use those “Spirit
Points” to unleash a powerful “Super Move.”
Just remember, strategy is the key, here.\e"
M00110008,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)And another thing. You can use your “Spirit
Points” all you want. You will regain a little
bit at the beginning of every round.\e"
M00110009,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)So, go ahead and use your “Super Moves” as
often as possible. It will make your battles
much easier.\c"
M00110010,"\h(«Vyse»)Could you teach me a few things about weapons?
The weapons that we use are made from Moon
Stones, right?\e"
M00110011,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)That's right. And because of that, assigning
different colored Moon Stones to your weapons
will change their properties.\e"
M00110012,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)A weapon modified by a Red Moon Stone has the
powers of fire, and a weapon modified with a
Yellow Moon Stone has the powers of lightning.\e"
M00110013,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)By knowing your enemies' weaknesses and choosing
the color of your weapon wisely, you may be able
to do greater damage to your enemies.\c"
M00110014,"\h(«Vyse»)No, it's okay. I think I know enough to
be alright.\e"
M00110015,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)Heh, sure. I suppose the best way to learn is to
get into a real battle situation, anyway. Well,
I hope you actually do know what you're doing!\c"
M00120000,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)If you can learn to use your “Magic” and “Super
Moves” skillfully, your fights will become a
whole lot easier.\e"
M00120001,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)I can teach you the basics on how to use these
if you want…\e"
M00120002,"\h(«What will you ask about?»)“Ask about magic.”
“Ask about Super Moves.”
“No, it's okay.”\e"
M00120003,"\h(«Vyse»)Can you teach me anything about magic? From what
I can tell, it's essentially a kind of power
drawn directly from the different Moons, right?\e"
M00120004,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)I suppose that's the easiest way to put it. But,
one thing you need to remember is that the true
power behind magic is your party's “Spirit.”\e"
M00120005,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Spells only take up 1 MP every time you cast
one. However, each spell takes a different
amount of “Spirit Points” to cast.\e"
M00120006,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)So, it's safe to assume that the more
Spirit Points a spell requires, the
more powerful it is.\e"
M00120007,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)In other words, since you're going to use 1 MP
to cast a spell anyway, you might as well cast
the spell that uses the most Spirit Points.\e"
M00120008,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Since your Spirit Points regenerate a little bit
at the beginning of each round, it's more
efficient to use as much as you can.\e"
M00120009,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Magic is divided into 6 different types. You can
gain experience in a type of magic depending on
what color you assign to your weapon.\e"
M00120010,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)So, if you want to learn a specific color of
magic, you should change the color of your
weapon to that color.\c"
M00120011,"\h(«Vyse»)Can you teach me anything about “Super Moves?”
What exactly are they?\e"
M00120012,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)To put it simply, they are special techniques.
Some of them are attacks, some are defensive
techniques, and some can even heal your party.\e"
M00120013,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)But, unlike magic, “Super Moves” are unique to
each person. Also, they don't use up MP. But,
instead, they use up a lot of Spirit Points.\e"
M00120014,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)They are quite powerful, but since they take up
a lot of Spirit Points, you need to learn how to
use them as effectively as possible.\e"
M00120015,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Oh, one more thing… if you ever come
across a fruit called a “Moonberry,”
consider yourself lucky.\e"
M00120016,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)If you eat a Moonberry, you can learn a new
“Super Move.” Some techniques require more
Moonberries than others, so use them wisely!\c"
M00120017,"\h(«Vyse»)No, it's okay. I think I know enough to
be alright.\e"
M00120018,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Heh, alright then. But, just remember, it never
hurts to ask a question. If you can't figure
something out, just come back here, okay?\c"
M00160000,"\h(«Ben the Lookout»)This is Lookout Island. We take turns
standing guard here to see if any
suspicious ships might be approaching.\e"
M00160001,"\h(«Ben the Lookout»)It gets cold early in the morning, and that can
be tough, but it's all part of the job, I guess.
You just have to sort of accept it.\c"
M00230000,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, here… take this. It's your share of
the loot from yesterday's raid.\e"
M00230001,\h( )You received a “Purple Moon Stone.”\e
M00230002,"\h(«Dyne»)That Moon Stone has been processed already, so
you should be able to use it on your weapons.\e"
M00230003,"\h(«Dyne»)Now you'll be able to change the color of
your weapon to Purple, and give it the power
of ice in battle.\e"
M00230004,"\h(«Vyse»)I see. Thanks, Dad. I'll use it carefully.\e"
M00230005,"\h(«Dyne»)One more thing. When you win a fight, you will
be awarded “magic experience” in the color of
magic that you have equipped on your weapon.\e"
M00230006,"\h(«Dyne»)When you accumulate a certain amount of magic
experience, you will learn a new spell. So,
if there is a spell that you want to learn…\e"
M00230007,"\h(«Dyne»)… by changing the color of your weapon to
match whatever type of magic you want to
learn, you can learn it much faster.\e"
M00230008,"\h(«Dyne»)You can easily change the color of your weapon
by using the “Equip” command or by pressing the
Y button during battles. Make good use of it.\c"
M00230009,"\h(«Dyne»)Hold on a second, Vyse.\e"
M00230010,"\h(«Dyne»)What's the matter, Vyse? Did you want me to
explain what Moon Stones do and how they
affect your weapons again?\e"
M00230011,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Yeah, that'd be great.”
“No, it's alright. I think I got it.”\e"
M00230012,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah, that'd be great. I just want to make
sure that I got my facts straight.\e"
M00230013,"\h(«Dyne»)This isn't like you. You usually can't stand
listening to me talk. Well, I hope it's a sign
that you're growing up a little.\e"
M00230014,"\h(«Dyne»)Refined Moon Stones can be used to change
the properties of your weapon.\e"
M00230015,"\h(«Dyne»)Each color has unique properties: Yellow is
lightning, Red is fire, and so forth.\e"
M00230016,"\h(«Dyne»)In addition, when you win a fight, you will
receive magic experience that corresponds
to the current color of your weapon.\e"
M00230017,"\h(«Dyne»)Each time this value reaches a certain level,
you will learn a new spell. So, if there's
a spell you want to learn…\e"
M00230018,"\h(«Dyne»)By changing the color of your weapon, you can
learn the magic of that color that much faster.\e"
M00230019,"\h(«Dyne»)You can easily change the color of your weapon
by using the “Equip” command or by pressing the
Y button during battle. Make good use of it.\c"
M00230020,"\h(«Vyse»)No thanks, I think I've got it. If there's
anything that I don't know, I'll probably find
out during battle… Hehe…\e"
M00230021,"\h(«Dyne»)Just be careful then…
And use those Moon Stones carefully! A good
Moon Stone isn't easy to find…\c"
M00210000,"\h(«Fina»)Thank you so much for everything you've done.
First, you rescued me… and then you let me
stay in your home… I'm eternally grateful.\e"
M00210001,"\h(«Fina»)I suppose you'll be leaving now to retreive that
Moon Stone that fell yesterday… Please do be
careful. Good luck!\c"
M00210002,"\h(«Fina»)I suppose you'll be leaving now to retreive that
Moon Stone that fell yesterday… Please do be
careful. Good luck!\c"
