MH0300000,"\h(«Aika»)It's great that we got the Blue Crystal
and all… but where do we go from here?\e"
MH0300001,"\h(«Enrique»)Perhaps we should return to Crescent Isle and
study the Book on Ship Polarity in order to
modify the Delphinus.\e"
MH0300002,"\h(«Aika»)Go home?
But that's to the west of here…
How are we supposed to get back?\e"
MH0300003,"\h(«How will you get back?»)“Let's go back through the Dark Rift.”
“Let's try heading east.”\e"
MH0300004,"\h(«Vyse»)We can just go back through the Dark Rift.
We'll just backtrack through the path 
that we took to get here.\e"
MH0300005,"\h(«Aika»)Well… we were pulled into the Dark Rift, 
so the winds are blowing in this direction.\e"
MH0300006,"\h(«Aika»)I don't think we'd be able to get back 
through it… not even with the Delphinus.\e"
MH0300007,"\h(«Enrique»)Hmm…
So the Dark Rift is a one way trip from 
west to east…\e"
MH0300008,"\h(«Aika»)I guess so…
How are we going to get home?\e"
MH0300009,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…
Maybe we can try to go east from here.\e"
MH0300010,"\h(«Aika»)Wait a second!
We'll just be getting farther away from
Crescent Isle!\e"
MH0300011,"\h(«Fina»)Umm… Didn't Belleza say that she came here 
by going west from Ixa'taka?\e"
MH0300012,"\h(«Fina»)If that is true, then if we go east from here, 
we should be able to reach Ixa'taka!\e"
MH0300013,"\h(«Aika»)What?!
So you mean that the east and west of the world
are connected?!\e"
MH0300014,"\h(«Enrique»)Hmm…
I seem to recall hearing legends about the world
being round.\e"
MH0300015,\h(«Enrique»)According to the geological studies of Valua…\e
MH0300016,"\h(«Enrique»)The world is a sphere. That means that the east
is connected to the west, and the north is
connected to the south.\e"
MH0300017,"\h(«Enrique»)Of course, no one has ever proven this… and
those that believe this to be true are branded
as heretics…\e"
MH0300018,"\h(«Vyse»)That's interesting…
Well, it looks like we're going to see if 
Belleza was telling the truth or not.\e"
MH0300019,"\h(«Vyse»)We came to Yafutoma from Crescent Isle by
heading east.\e"
MH0300020,\h(«Vyse»)We'll continue on sailing to the east.\e
MH0300021,"\h(«Vyse»)And if we reach Crescent Isle…
We will prove that the world is round!\e"
MH0300022,"\h(«Aika»)Wow!!! You mean we're actually going to try to
sail around the world?!!!\e"
MH0300023,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright, everyone! Prepare for departure!
We're going east!
Destination Crescent Isle!\e"
MG0210000,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, it's time.
Fina, where should we head next?\e"
MG0210001,"\h(«Fina»)In the East, there is a land that basks in the
light of the Blue Moon. That land is known as
Yafutoma.\e"
MG0210002,"\h(«Fina»)They harness the powers of the Blue Moon,
and have control over wind and water.
Their culture is very different from yours.\e"
MG0210003,\h(«Enrique»)Yafutoma… Yafutoma…\e
MG0210004,"\h(«Vyse»)You've heard of it, Enrique?\e"
MG0210005,"\h(«Enrique»)Yes.
According to Valuan historians…\e"
MG0210006,"\h(«Enrique»)Yafutoma is a country far east of Nasr.
It is scattered across several small islands.\e"
MG0210007,"\h(«Enrique»)I remember the stories… The people are
protected by scales and they eat by manipulating
two sticks to pick up their food.\e"
MG0210008,"\h(«Aika»)They eat with sticks? 
And are protected by scales?\e"
MG0210009,"\h(«Aika»)How are you supposed to eat with two sticks? 
And what do you mean “scales?” 
Are they monsters?!\e"
MG0210010,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…
Somehow, I don't think it's what 
you're imagining, Aika…\e"
MG0210011,"\h(«Aika»)I wonder what these strange wind and water 
people look like… And I still can't 
imagine eating with two sticks…\e"
MG0210012,"\h(«Aika»)I was hoping that we'd get to eat all kinds of
exotic food on our trip…
This has me a little worried…\e"
MG0210013,"\h(«Enrique»)To get to Yafutoma, we should sail around the
southern tip of Nasr.\e"
MG0210014,"\h(«Enrique»)Some time ago, during the Valuan - Nasr War,
a cape was discovered by invading Valuan forces
south of Nasr.\e"
MG0210015,"\h(«Enrique»)That cape was named Cape Victory. 
There is a city there called Esparanza.\e"
MG0210016,"\h(«Enrique»)If anyone knows how to get to Yafutoma,
it would be the people there.\e"
MG0210017,"\h(«Vyse»)Okay, so we're heading south of Nasr.
Alright, everyone to their stations! Let's go!\e"
MG0270000,"\h(«Aika»)Alright!
We're doing great!\e"
MG0270001,"\h(«Fina»)Gregorio's ship dead ahead!
He'll be in range shortly!\e"
MG0270002,\h(«Enrique»)Uncle Gregorio… I can't let you take me back!\e
MG0270003,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright… Full speed ahead!!!
It's now or never!\e"
MG0250000,"\h(«Vice Captain»)Admiral, the Delphinus is approaching.
It is moving into attack position.\e"
MG0250001,"\h(«Gregorio»)My orders were to bring him back alive, or kill
him if he refuses. We must do everything in our
power to take him alive.\e"
MG0250002,"\h(«Gregorio»)All ships, prepare to attack! The Delphinus is
the Armada's most powerful ship. Our adversaries
may be young, but we can't underestimate them.\e"
MG0250003,\h(«Aika»)Vyse! The Armada is getting ready to attack us.\e
MG0250004,\h(«Vyse»)This is it!\e
MG0250005,"\h(«Vyse»)Everyone, man your battle stations!
We've got to get past Admiral Gregorio's
defenses!\e"
MG0250006,"\h(«Vyse»)We will defeat him! Then we'll get through 
the Dark Rift and reach Yafutoma!\e"
MG0250007,\h(«Everyone»)Aye aye!\e
ML0170000,\h(«Aika»)Fina…\e
ML0170001,\h(«Fina»)……\e
ML0170002,"\h(«Fina»)The Elders… they finally believed in the
future…\e"
ML0170003,"\h(«Fina»)They sacrificed themselves to give us a chance
at saving the world.\e"
ML0170004,\h(«Vyse»)I'll make sure their sacrifice was not in vain.\e
ML0170006,\h(«Vyse»)Huh?\e
ML0170007,\h(«Vyse»)Captain Drachma!\e
ML0170008,"\h(«Drachma»)We have defeated the Armada. Most of the ships
fled once the Hydra was destroyed.\e"
ML0170009,"\h(«Drachma»)It's time to go to Soltis, boy.
Look over there.\e"
ML0170010,\h(«Vyse»)That's… Shrine Island!\e
ML0170011,"\h(«Drachma»)Aye, a perfect fit.\e"
ML0170012,"\h(«Aika»)So, Shrine Island was a part of Soltis, huh?\e"
ML0170013,"\h(«Drachma»)Maybe you'll be able to get into Soltis through
there.\e"
ML0170014,"\h(«Drachma»)I'll go with you.
I may be old, but I can still fight better than
most men.\e"
ML0170015,"\h(«Enrique»)The rest of us will wait here in the ship.
If you want any of us to take the place of 
anyone else, just come back here.\e"
ML0170016,"\h(«Vyse»)Really?
If you'll come with us, Captain, we'd be
honored.\e"
ML0170017,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, make sure you are well prepared before you
head in there. You should never rush into a
fight.\e"
ML0170018,"\h(«Vyse»)I know. Thanks, Gilder.\e"
ML0170019,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright, everyone, get ready!
We're going back to Shrine Island!\e"
ML0090000,"\h(«Aika»)We've broken their front line, 
but reinforcements are closing in fast!\e"
ML0090001,"\h(«Vyse»)Galcian, I'm coming for you!!!\e"
MJ0210000,"\h(«Baltor»)Curse you, Vyse!
How could you defeat me… again?!\e"
MJ0210001,"\h(«Baltor»)The next time we meet, I will defeat you! 
You will rue the day that you crossed Baltor!!!\e"
MJ0210002,"\h(«Aika»)Good job, Vyse!\e"
MJ0210003,"\h(«Vyse»)Seriously… that fool doesn't know when to give
up… But at least he's not a quitter.\e"
MJ0210004,"\h(«Fina»)Not only do you have the Armada chasing you,
Vyse… the Black Pirates are after you as well!
You're quite popular…\e"
MJ0210005,"\h(«Vyse»)Ahahaha…
This isn't the kind of popularity that I need… \e"
MJ0210006,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, I'm glad my last battle on the Delphinus
was a victorious one.\e"
MJ0210007,\h(«Aika»)Enrique…\e
MJ0210008,\h(«Enrique»)Hahaha… I'm sorry.\e
MJ0210009,"\h(«Enrique»)Alright, Sailors' Island should be coming up
soon. Vyse, let's go!\e"
Ms034a008,"\h(«Vyse»)It's the emblem of the Valuan royal family.
Heh… I think it's time to cover it up with the
flag of the Blue Rogues!\c"
Ms034a009,"\h(«Vyse»)It's the flag that I designed…
I always wondered if I'd ever get to be the
captain of my own ship since I was a kid…\c"
Ms034a010,"\h(«Vyse»)This is our new flag. Heh… Leave it to Aika to
design a flag like this.\c"
Ms034a011,"\h(«Vyse»)This is our new flag. Fina's just makes me think
of flying freely through the skies… It's a
refreshing feeling.\c"
Ms034a012,"\h(«Vyse»)This is where Marco snuck aboard the Delphinus.
Heh… Maybe that kid is cut out to be an Air
Pirate after all…\c"
Ms034a013,"\h(«Vyse»)This is the captain's chair. I guess that means
it's mine… I'd rather be at the helm, though. I
wouldn't feel right just sitting here.\c"
Ms034a014,"\h(«Vyse»)They sure didn't spare any expenses building
this thing. All of the gauges are brand new.
Well, it WAS meant for the prince, I suppose…\c"
Ms034a015,"\h(«Giler»)Hey, Vyse… Before we set sail, there was
something that I wanted to talk to you about.\c"
Ms034a016,"\h(«Vyse»)Well… I suppose it's about time
we set sail again…\e"
Ms034a017,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ms034a018,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright!
Delphinus, full speed ahead!\c"
Ms034a019,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, now that I think about it, there
were a few more things I wanted to take care
of first…\c"
Ms034a020,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\c"
Ms034a021,"\h(«Vyse»)It's too dangerous to try and maneuver while
the enemy's ship is latched onto ours…
I need to get out on deck first!\c"
M00040000,"\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!
Pow pow!\c"
M01110000,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to go to Crescent Isle, right?
It's to the north of Nasr.
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110001,"\h(«Lawrence»)Esparanza is to the south of Nasr.
Do you want to take the wheel now?\e"
M01110002,"\h(«Lawrence»)There should be a calm spot somewhere in the
Dark Rift… we should be able to get through
there. Do you want to take the wheel now?\e"
M01110003,"\h(«Lawrence»)If we continue to the northeast from here, we
should reach Yafutoma… Do you want to take the
wheel?\e"
M01110004,"\h(«Lawrence»)I'll take it from here.
You better hurry up and get on deck.\c"
M01110005,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to head to the Land of Ice, right?
I believe it's south of South Ocean.
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110006,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to go beneath Valua?
Sure… do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110007,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to go to Dangral Island? It's beneath 
the clouds to the southwest of Sailors' Island, 
right? Do you want to take the wheel then?\e"
M01110008,"\h(«Lawrence»)Beneath the Great Cloud Sea by the vortex near 
Shrine Island, right?
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110009,"\h(«Lawrence»)Go to Sailors' Island?
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110010,"\h(«Lawrence»)We have to go to the island that appeared in
Mid Ocean, right? Do you want to take the wheel 
now?\e"
M01110011,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
M01110012,"\h(«Lawrence»)Alright. Here, take the wheel.\c"
M01110013,\h(«Lawrence»)I see.\c
M01110014,"\h(«Lawrence»)If I had known how big this job was going to be,
I would've asked for more than 10,000 gold…\e"
M01110015,"\h(«Lawrence»)So, do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110016,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
M01110017,"\h(«Lawrence»)Alright, I leave the ship in your hands, 
Captain Vyse.\c"
M01110018,"\h(«Lawrence»)Very well then. I will continue flying the ship
for now. You should probably go around and talk
to the rest of the crew.\c"
M01140002,"\h(«Pinta»)Esparanza was a rather prosperous city…
Until Valua abandoned it.\e"
M01140003,"\h(«Pinta»)Since then, all trade with Esparanza stopped. 
The place is full of rusted metal and sailors 
who've lost all hope.\c"
M01140004,"\h(«Pinta»)When Esparanza was at its peak, there were
travelers coming from all over, tempting fate,
trying to pass through the Dark Rift.\e"
M01140005,"\h(«Pinta»)And I've heard that there were plenty of thieves
and crooked merchants that gathered there, as
well, to prey upon the optimistic sailors.\c"
M01140006,"\h(«Pinta»)We made it through the Dark Rift! I can search 
for items in this part of the world now, too!\c"
M01140007,"\h(«Pinta»)In Valua, there was once a scholar that claimed 
the world was round. However, he was shunned as 
a lunatic by some, and a heretic by others.\c"
M01140008,"\h(«Pinta»)So, in order to prove his theory, the scholar 
set out to sail around the world… but he was 
killed in the Dark Rift.\c"
M01140009,"\h(«Pinta»)I've heard that the Nasultan sends a personal
retainer to the Lands of Ice once a year to
bring back as much ice as he can.\e"
M01140010,"\h(«Pinta»)Having ice in Nasr is the ultimate luxury. Only 
the Nasultan himself is rich enough to actually
enjoy it… and that's only once a year.\c"
M01140011,"\h(«Pinta»)The temple at the Maw of Tartas is probably the
biggest mystery in all of Valua.\e"
M01140012,"\h(«Pinta»)There are stories of earthquakes on that part of
the island. But if the island is floating, what
is causing it to shake?\c"
M01140013,"\h(«Pinta»)I've heard stories that Valua is building some 
sort of elevator to reach below the Great Cloud 
Sea.\e"
M01140014,"\h(«Pinta»)However, nobody knows where that elevator 
actually stops… or how deep it actually goes.\c"
M01140015,"\h(«Pinta»)People say all sorts of things about the world
under the clouds. Some say it's the land of the
dead, others say that it's a land of pure gold.\e"
M01140016,"\h(«Pinta»)But, nobody has actually ever seen Deep Sky 
before. It's all a big mystery.\c"
M01140017,"\h(«Pinta»)The Valuans promised a reward for anyone who 
could find Enrique and safely take him back… 
Valuan Bounty Hunters were searching for him.\e"
M01140018,"\h(«Pinta»)But, nobody expected him to come back of his own
accord. The Bounty Hunters were upset, to say
the least.\c"
M01140019,"\h(«Pinta»)So, there really is a shrine far above the sky?\e"
M01140020,"\h(«Pinta»)Heh… Not even I knew about that. I'd really
like to see it once with my own eyes!\c"
M01140021,"\h(«Pinta»)I can't believe that an island actually rose up 
from beneath the clouds!\c"
M01140022,"\h(«Pinta»)Vyse, if you win this fight and make it home 
safely…\e"
M01140023,"\h(«Pinta»)I will spread tales of your adventures! Everyone
will know of Vyse, the Air Pirate equalled only
by Daccat, himself!\c"
M01140024,"\h(«Pinta»)Enemies are trying to board us?! Oh no!
We need to prepare for battle!\c"
M05100000,"\h(«Hans»)This ship is amazing!
The sheer power required just to propel it must 
be astronomical!\c"
M05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Wow… the exterior of the Delphinus is so
durable that you could probably fly right
through stone reefs or even through glaciers!\c"
M05100002,"\h(«Hans»)That ship… That was Drachma's Little Jack, 
right?\e"
M05100003,"\h(«Hans»)My father was saying that even though the ship
is old, it is well loved and well taken care of.
He said it was a very good ship.\c"
M05100004,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse, let's explore everywhere we can! Now that 
we can go to high and low altitudes, we should 
take as much advantage of it as possible!\e"
M05100005,"\h(«Hans»)I really can't wait to see how the newly 
upgraded Delphinus will perform!\c"
M05100006,"\h(«Hans»)You got a hold of the Valuan schematics for the
new engine? Wow, I'd really like to take a look
at those!\c"
M05100007,"\h(«Hans»)I can't wait to see what lies beneath the Great
Cloud Sea! Let's hurry up and test the
submerging capabilities of the Delphinus!\c"
M05100008,"\h(«Hans»)It's a little disheartening to think that once
we return, Enrique will be leaving us to go back
to Valua…\c"
M05100009,"\h(«Hans»)So, Fina's ship can reach great altitudes, 
right? I wonder what kind of engine it uses…\c"
M05100010,"\h(«Hans»)I wonder how much power was required to raise
Soltis out of Deep Sky.\c"
M05100011,"\h(«Hans»)There was a bright light that came from that 
island! I wonder what the source of the light 
was…\c"
M05100012,"\h(«Hans»)The Delphinus is completely repaired! Let's go, 
Captain Vyse!\c"
M07060000,"\h(«Don»)We should probably head back to Crescent Isle.
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M07060001,"\h(«Don»)Hmm… The Land of Ice should be a little farther
south than South Ocean. Do you want to take the
wheel now?\e"
M07060002,"\h(«Don»)We were supposed to head over to Valua and check
out what's beneath it, right? Maybe you should
take the wheel now…\e"
M07060003,"\h(«Don»)Dangral Island should be beneath the clouds to 
the southwest of Sailors' Island. You want to
take the wheel now?\e"
M07060004,"\h(«Don»)The vortex that will take us into Deep Sky is
near Shrine Island, right? That means it should
be somewhere in Mid Ocean.\e"
M07060005,"\h(«Don»)Sailors' Island is in Mid Ocean, right? So, 
Captain… do you want to take the wheel now?\e"
M07060006,"\h(«Don»)You mean we're going to that island that 
appeared in Mid Ocean? Oh man… 
I've got a bad feeling about this…\e"
M07060007,"\h(«Don»)Well, then. I'll be relaxing downstairs in the 
mess hall. I leave the ship in your hands, Vyse.\c"
M07060008,"\h(«Don»)Heh… Well, I guess that means I can fly the
ship for a little while longer.\c"
M07060009,"\h(«Don»)We're going to fly into that island, right? Do
you want to take the wheel then, Captain Vyse?\c"
M07060010,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship a little longer.”\e"
M07060011,"\h(«Don»)Alright then. Good luck, Captain!\c"
M07060012,"\h(«Don»)Alright, I'll take care of the ship for now. Go
down and talk with the rest of the crew then.\c"
M08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)I… I don't know much about sailing, or even the
world outside of Yafutoma…\e"
M08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)… but I promise that I will try my hardest to 
help everyone as much as I can.\c"
M08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)A land totally covered in ice…
I never would have imagined that places like 
that actually existed.\c"
M08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique told me about the man named 
Drachma.\e"
M08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)He has been through so much. I hope he will find
peace.\c"
M08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Although, I know we're not actually going inside
the city of Valua, I still feel nervous… for 
Enrique.\c"
M08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse, you've gathered all of the Moon Crystals! 
Congratulations!\e"
M08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)I am worried about Fina… she doesn't look too 
well. Perhaps she is just tired.\c"
M08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Ever since we returned from Dangral Island, 
Enrique has been so quiet… I hope that he 
is okay…\c"
M08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse… I, I know that I am a member of this crew
and my loyalties lie with you but…\e"
M08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)… there is a part of me that wishes we never 
reach Sailors' Island. I have a feeling that 
something bad is going to happen to Enrique.\c"
M08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique is fighting bravely on his own in
Valua… I, too, must fight and do my best to
help!\c"
M08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)That island that rose up from beneath the clouds
… something is… strange about it. I sense a 
great power coming from the island…\c"
M08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)I, I thought I heard Prince Enrique calling out
just now. I'm sorry, it must be my imagination…
I feel terrible…\e"
M08070014,\h(«Moegi»)Vyse… I know something bad has happened…\c
M08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Let us carry on, Vyse!
I may not be very strong, but I will do my best 
to help fight!\c"
M08070016,"\h(«Brabham»)That Yafutoman book is amazing! I can't believe 
how advanced they are!\e"
M08070023,"\h(«Brabham»)I'll be an expert on this stuff by the time we 
get back from the Land of Ice.\c"
M08070017,"\h(«Brabham»)Now, with the engine specs that I learned from 
the Yafutomans, we can fly all over the damn 
place!\c"
M08070018,"\h(«Brabham»)Hmm… Enrique looks upset. Back in my day, we 
used to pick up on the ladies… They go crazy 
for sailors! That'd cheer us right up! Yessiree!\c"
M08070019,"\h(«Brabham»)Building that Great Cloud Sea Engine was the
hardest thing I've done in a long time! My back
still hurts from all of that hard labor!\e"
M08070020,"\h(«Brabham»)I never thought I'd see an engine that powerful 
in my life… You'd never guess that I'm 147.\c"
M08070021,\h(«Brabham»)That crazy island… it came from Deep Sky!\c
M08070022,"\h(«Brabham»)The Delphinus is running better than ever! 
I love this ship! Ain't it a beaut?\c"
Mp0010003,"\h(«Aika»)This is great, huh Vyse? We can finally make it 
through the sky rifts!\c"
Mp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)I can't believe it! I know there's so much to 
see out there!\c"
Mp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)So, we're trying to get through the Dark Rift,
huh? I wonder what it's really like in there. As
much as I hate to admit it, I'm kinda scared.\c"
Mp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, you did it!
We made it through the Dark Rift!\e"
Mp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)Now we can see what kind of place Yafutoma 
really is! I hope they don't try to eat us with
sticks. Fina better hide Cupil… \e"
Mp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! The enemy's preparing to board us! We need
you on deck fast!\c"
Mp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)The Tenkou, huh?
I guess that even Yafutoma has a little Air 
Pirate problem of their own…\c"
Mp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)If we continue due east from here and we reach 
Crescent Isle, that would only mean one thing…\e"
Mp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)…that the edges of the world are connected!
But, then I suppose they wouldn't really be the
edges of the world…\c"
Mp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)The whole island is frozen! Hehe… one Vysicle 
coming right up! You'd better be careful, 
I didn't bring a chisel.\c"
Mp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)Cap'n Drachma…
I hope he's going to be okay… \c"
Mp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)Well, since we can reach high and low altitudes 
now, we'll be able to go just about anywhere!\c"
Mp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)We've collected all of the Moon Crystals!
Let's hurry up and get back to Crescent Isle!\c"
Mp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)Dangral Island, huh…
It should be beneath the clouds southwest 
of Sailors' Island…\c"
Mp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)I feel so bad for Enrique. He must feel awful. 
I think we should leave him alone for a while.\e"
Mp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)We should be able to go down into Deep Sky 
through the vortex near Shrine Island. Let's go,
Vyse!\c"
Mp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)I guess we have to say our good-byes to Enrique
once we get back to Sailors' Island… I hate
good-byes…\e"
Mp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)If we don't stop Galcian, who knows what'll
happen! Vyse, we have to hurry and get to 
Dangral Island!\c"
Mp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Who would've guessed that there used to be an
island that big in Mid Ocean… And right next to
our very own Pirate Isle…\c"
Mp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse…
We should return to Crescent Isle soon.\e"
Mp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)I hate to admit it, but… I don't think we can
do anything against that island right now.\c"
Mp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)Well, I guess it's time to settle this.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared…\e"
Mp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)But, when I look at how great of a captain
you've become, Vyse, I feel better. Look at how
many people have come to follow you into battle!\e"
Mp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)They all believe in you… they all trust you… 
just like I do. We have to win, right? Captain 
Vyse?\c"
Mp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)The city of Esparanza…
We should head there first. It is located on the
southern tip of Nasr.\c"
Mp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)If we can get through the Dark Rift, the country
of Yafutoma should be on the other side.\c"
Mp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)We've finally made it to the skies of the Blue
Moon… The lands of Yafutoma should be close
by…\c"
Mp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse! It's too dangerous to go out on deck 
without being prepared for battle!\c"
Mp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)It's so strange…
I am a Silvite. I was born and raised in the 
Great Silver Shrine…\e"
Mp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)But, somehow, I feel more at home on Crescent 
Isle than any place else…\c"
Mp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)The Land of Ice…
Somewhere, buried beneath all that ice, lies the
Purple Crystal, I hope we can find it…\c"
Mp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse…
Let us return to Crescent Isle.\c"
Mp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)I never thought we could enter Valua through 
the Maw of Tartas…\c"
Mp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)At last, we have the fifth Crystal!\e"
Mp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)If we can find the blueprints for that Valuan 
ship on Dangral Island, we could make our way 
into Deep Sky and search for my ship…\c"
Mp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique… He's been so quiet lately. I am a 
little concerned about him…\c"
Mp0020014,\h(«Fina»)I was attacked by Valua near Pirate Isle…\e
Mp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)My ship must be somewhere in Deep Sky around 
there.\c"
Mp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique will at last be able to return to his 
homeland…\c"
Mp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez… we must stop him!
We must hurry to Dangral Island!\c"
Mp0020018,\h(«Fina»)Ramirez… I wonder what he's doing on Soltis!\e
Mp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)…!!
No… he, he wouldn't…\c"
Mp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Why, Vyse… Why?\c"
Mp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, let's go!
We've got to go to Soltis!\e"
Mp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)I will fight with you!
Ramirez must be stopped.\c"
Ma0040000,\h(«Pow»)Pow! Pow! Pow!\e
Ma1110000,\h(«Lawrence»)Do you want to take the wheel?\e
Ma1110001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma1110002,"\h(«Lawrence»)Alright, I leave the ship in your hands then.\c"
Ma1110003,\h(«Lawrence»)I see. Very well then.\c
Ma1110004,"\h(«Lawrence»)I've been chased all over by all sorts of
ships… But I've never been chased into Deep Sky
before. Heh… First time for everything I guess.\e"
Ma1110005,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma1110006,"\h(«Lawrence»)Visibility is bad right now. Just be careful 
where you fly.\c"
Ma1110007,\h(«Lawrence»)I see. Very well then.\c
Ma1140000,"\h(«Pinta»)The remains of so many ships are down here. It's
kind of scary when you think about it.\c"
Ma1140001,"\h(«Pinta»)Many adventurers have tried to travel through 
Valua by going through the cracks and fissures 
beneath it.\e"
Ma1140002,"\h(«Pinta»)But their ships couldn't fly low enough to reach
the entrance.\c"
Ma1140003,"\h(«Pinta»)I'm happy to have been one of the chosen few to
see Deep Sky…\e"
Ma1140004,"\h(«Pinta»)But, my one regret is that it was not aboard my
own ship. I suppose you can't have everything…\c"
Ma2000000,"\h(«Marco»)This place gives me the creeps… Let's hurry up
and finish what we came here to do so we can get
out!\c"
Ma2000001,"\h(«Marco»)The city I used to live in is above us right
now. I never thought I'd get out of there…\c"
Ma2000002,"\h(«Marco»)Brabham told me that the reason why we have to
keep the shutters closed while we're down here
is so we don't see the ghosts outside…\e"
Ma2000003,\h(«Marco»)I wonder if there really are ghosts down here…\c
Ma5100000,"\h(«Hans»)This ship is probably the first ship to ever 
make it through the Maw of Tartas. That's quite 
an accomplishment in itself.\c"
Ma5100001,"\h(«Hans»)The engine checks out okay. It's so amazing that
someone actually built a ship of this power and
magnitude! I'm definitely impressed…\c"
Ma5100002,"\h(«Hans»)So, this is the infamous Dark Rift that's
claimed so many lives… And the Delphinus
doesn't even sway in the winds… Amazing…\c"
Ma5210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)There are too many rocks. This place is ugly. 
Maybe that's why Valuans think so many ugly 
thoughts.\c"
Ma5210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)I can't see much. But I sense some very bad 
things here.\c"
Ma5210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)There are a lot of sunken ships down here. I 
wonder if there's a lot of treasure…\c"
Ma7060000,"\h(«Don»)It's so hard to see down here… It's almost 
impossible to tell where we're going. 
Huh? Did you want to take the wheel, Captain?\e"
Ma7060001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma7060002,"\h(«Don»)Alright. Just make sure not to run into anything
and you should be fine.\c"
Ma7060003,"\h(«Don»)Oh well… I guess that means I have to stay here
and keep us alive. Back to work, back to work…\c"
Ma7060004,"\h(«Don»)Visibility is horrible, we don't know where
we're going, and you're still making me fly this
thing!! Hurry up and take the wheel, will ya?\e"
Ma7060005,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma7060006,"\h(«Don»)Thank the Moons! I can finally relax. Just be
careful and don't get us all killed, okay,
Captain?\c"
Ma7060007,"\h(«Don»)What?! Oh, alright… I'll try to keep us alive 
for a little while longer, I guess.\c"
Ma7060008,"\h(«Don»)So, this is what the Dark Rift looks like from 
the inside… So many of my friends met their 
fate here… Maybe you should take the wheel…\e"
Ma7060009,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma7060010,"\h(«Don»)Thank you, Vyse. I'll be down in the galley. 
This is a little hard for me to deal with…\c"
Ma7060011,"\h(«Don»)Alright, Captain… I'll try my best.\c"
Ma8070000,"\h(«Moegi»)It's hard to believe that we are under Prince 
Enrique's homeland right now.\c"
Ma8070001,"\h(«Moegi»)In Yafutoma, there are tales of demons that live
beneath the clouds and eat bad children.\e"
Ma8070002,"\h(«Moegi»)But looking at how dark the world is down here,
I can almost believe those children's stories…\c"
Ma8070003,"\h(«Moegi»)This storm… I believe you called it the Dark 
Rift… It is what kept Yafutoma separated from
the rest of the world…\c"
Ma4000000,"\h(«Brabham»)This is probably the only ship in the whole 
world that can survive the trip into Deep Sky.\e"
Ma4000001,"\h(«Brabham»)And just think! The Delphinus is the first ship
to enter the Maw of Tartas, too!!\c"
Ma4000002,"\h(«Brabham»)The engine checks out okay! We're still holding
up strong!\c"
Ma4000003,"\h(«Brabham»)The Dark Rift shouldn't be a problem for the 
Delphinus. We should be able to fly straight 
through!\c"
Ma4050000,"\h(«Domingo»)When I think of the fact that not even the 
Valuans themselves have seen the inside of the 
Maw of Tartas…\e"
Ma4050001,"\h(«Domingo»)… it makes even the walls of this place look… 
valuable, for some reason. Wouldn't you agree, 
Vyse?\c"
Ma4050002,"\h(«Domingo»)Take a look around, Vyse…
Nobody has ever set foot in this place before…
Think about it, we're actually in Deep Sky…\e"
Ma4050003,"\h(«Domingo»)It sort of brings a little color to this 
otherwise drab place, doesn't it? Just think of 
all the sunken treasure that's down here…\c"
Ma4050004,"\h(«Domingo»)There's quite a few sunken ships down here. I 
wonder how many of those ships are Air Pirate 
ships…\e"
Ma4050005,"\h(«Domingo»)Heh… It sort of makes one want to go out and 
search the wreckage for treasure, doesn't it?\c"
Ma4060000,"\h(«Ilchymis»)So, this is the Maw of Tartas, huh?
Heh… I bet the other scientists of Valua would 
worship me if they knew I was actually in here…\c"
Ma4060001,"\h(«Ilchymis»)This place is amazing… The raw energy that 
is brewing in this place is… magnificent.\c"
Ma4060002,"\h(«Ilchymis»)So… this is the infamous Dark Rift. So many 
people have lost their lives in these winds…\c"
Maa010000,"\h(«Aika»)Wow… Look at all of those sunken ships. There 
are probably a lot of ghosts roaming around 
outside… Vyse! Let's get out of here soon!\c"
Maa010001,"\h(«Aika»)If we can make our way through all of these 
crevices, then we should be able to reach the 
area beneath the Great Seal, right?\c"
Maa010002,"\h(«Aika»)We have to find Fina's ship.
When something shows up on the sonar, you have 
to use the claw to try and get it, okay?\c"
Maa010003,"\h(«Aika»)Wow… That thing sure was tough. Let's hurry up 
and find Fina's ship so we can get back to 
Crescent Isle!\c"
Maa010004,"\h(«Aika»)This place sure gives me the creeps… No matter 
how many times we come here. Can we go home now,
Vyse?\c"
Maa010005,"\h(«Aika»)The air down here even looks like it's hard to 
breathe… But, I have to admit that it's kinda 
interesting down here, though.\c"
Maa020000,"\h(«Fina»)If we can safely get through the Dark Rift, the
country of Yafutoma should be somewhere on the
other side.\c"
Maa020001,"\h(«Fina»)It… it saddens me to think of all the brave
sailors that lost their lives in this maelstrom.\c"
Maa020002,"\h(«Fina»)The Yellow Gigas sleeps somewhere in the Maw of 
Tartas…\e"
Maa020003,"\h(«Fina»)If the stories are correct, the Yellow Crystal 
will be embedded into the body of the Yellow 
Gigas. We must use extreme caution…\c"
Maa020004,"\h(«Fina»)It feels a little strange to be flying inside 
the actual island of Valua, doesn't it?\c"
Maa020005,"\h(«Fina»)This… this place is amazing.
I wonder if we'll really be able to find my ship
down here…\c"
Maa020006,"\h(«Fina»)This place frightens me, no matter how many 
times we come here…\c"
Maa040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Ungh… The ship is rocking… so much…
Please don't bother me right now… I… I feel 
rather ill.\c"
Maa040001,"\h(«Enrique»)The Armada couldn't even make it through the
Dark Rift, and here we are…\c"
Maa040002,"\h(«Enrique»)I never dreamed that I would actually be flying 
inside the lands of Valua…\e"
Maa040003,"\h(«Enrique»)I would never have seen sights such as this had 
I remained cooped up in the palace…\c"
Maa040004,"\h(«Enrique»)The view is amazing… I never imagined that a 
world such as this existed beneath the clouds.\e"
Maa040005,"\h(«Enrique»)What is the Armada trying to accomplish by 
building ships that can travel down here? I 
wonder what Galcian is up to…\c"
Maa040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Soon, the battle will be over. We must defeat 
Ramirez and bring peace back to the people of 
this world!\c"
Maa040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, take me with you. Let me go with you into 
Soltis.\e"
Maa040008,"\h(«Will you take Enrique with you?»)“Of course, Enrique.”
“Sorry, but we need you here.”\e"
Maa040009,"\h(«Vyse»)Of course, Enrique.
It would be an honor for you to join us.\e"
Maa040010,"\h(«Enrique»)Thank you, Vyse!
I'll fight to the best of my ability! I will not
let you down…\e"
Maa040011,\h( )Enrique has joined your party.\c
Maa040012,"\h(«Enrique»)I see.
Well, if you change your mind, just let me know.
I am ready to fight at a moment's notice.\c"
Mg0040000,"\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!
Pow pow!\c"
Mg1110000,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to go to Crescent Isle, right?
Hmm… to the north of Nasr?
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
Mg1110001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around a bit more.”\e"
Mg1110002,\h(«Lawrence»)Very well. I will leave everything to you.\c
Mg1110003,"\h(«Lawrence»)Very well. I will man the helm for a little
while longer.\c"
Mg1140000,"\h(«Pinta»)Prince Enrique's ship was to be the strongest 
boat in the entire Valuan Armada! It was made 
using Valua's newest alloys and technologies!\e"
Mg1140001,"\h(«Pinta»)And not only did you manage to steal the ship, 
Vyse, you also managed to steal the prince away 
from Valua! You've become quite famous!\c"
Mg2000000,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this?
Is something in here?\e"
Mg2000001,"\h(«Marco»)*Yawn*
Oh man, it feels so good to finally get out of 
there.\e"
Mg2000002,"\h(«Marco»)Heh… Long time no see, Vyse!\e"
Mg2000003,"\h(«Vyse»)Marco!
What are you doing here?!\e"
Mg2000004,"\h(«Marco»)I heard that the prince's ship was finished and 
was being prepared for departure.\e"
Mg2000005,"\h(«Marco»)So, I snuck on board and I was planning on 
escaping Valua in it.\e"
Mg2000006,"\h(«Marco»)Well, I'd heard that the prince was a really 
nice guy, so I figured he wouldn't kill me for 
trying to escape. Well, at least not right away.\e"
Mg2000007,"\h(«Marco»)But I never would've thought that you, of all
people, would get your hands on this ship! At
least now I don't have to go looking for you!\e"
Mg2000008,"\h(«Marco»)I'm gonna travel along with you whether you like
it or not. But don't worry… I'll stay outta
your way, okay?\e"
Mg2000009,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… You're pretty pushy there, kid. Ah, why 
not… I'll make you my first crew member!\e"
Mg2000010,\h( )Marco has joined your crew as a “Sailor.”\c
Mgg050000,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey, Vyse.
I don't know where it's coming from, but I keep 
hearing this strange noise up here…\e"
Mgg050001,"\h(«Gilder»)I've looked around, but couldn't find where it
was coming from. Maybe you'll have better luck.
Oh, and when you're done, I need to talk to you.\c"
Mgg050002,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey there, Vyse. Have you finished looking 
around the ship? There's something that I need 
to talk to you about.\e"
Mgg050003,"\h(«What do you say?»)“Actually, I'm not quite finished yet.”
“I've pretty much seen everything I wanted to.”\e"
Mgg050004,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, I'm not quite finished looking around 
yet…\e"
Mgg050005,"\h(«Gilder»)That's no problem. Just take your time. But, 
when you're finished, I still need to talk to 
you, okay?\e"
Mgg050006,"\h(«Vyse»)I've pretty much seen everything that I wanted 
to. What did you want to talk to me about?\e"
Mgg050007,"\h(«Gilder»)Well, actually…\e"
Mgg010000,"\h(«Aika»)This Crescent Isle that we're heading towards is
the island that you were stranded on, right? I
can't wait to see what it looks like!\e"
Mgg010001,"\h(«Aika»)But, I still can't believe it… We're actually 
going to have our own headquarters! Just like 
Pirate Isle! Is this exciting or what?!\e"
Mgg010002,"\h(«Aika»)We should just concentrate on saving up 100,000 
gold. Having a base is more important than 
getting the Crystals right away!\c"
Mgg020000,"\h(«Fina»)Haha… I've been curious as to what sort of 
island you were stranded on.\c"
Mgg020001,"\h(«Fina»)We should try and save up some money so that 
Brabham can make the necessary modifications to 
this ship. It shouldn't take that long…\c"
