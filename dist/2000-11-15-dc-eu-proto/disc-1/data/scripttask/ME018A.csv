MG0220000,"\h(«Pitiful Sailor»)You're not from around here, are ya?\e"
MG0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, we just came into town and we were
wondering if someone here could help us.\e"
MG0220002,"\h(«Pitiful Sailor»)So you came to me… 
Well, that's just great…\e"
MG0220003,"\h(«Don»)By the way, the name is Don. Now ask me your
question and be on your way.\e"
MG0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)You know that sky rift to the east… 
How do you get through it?\e"
MG0220005,"\h(«Don»)So, yer lookin' for a way to cross 
the Dark Rift, eh? \e"
MG0220006,"\h(«Don»)MWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
So, the world is still full of fools…\e"
MG0220007,\h(«Vyse»)…?\e
MG0220008,\h(«Aika»)What?\e
MG0220009,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Are you kids serious?
You're trying to cross the Dark Rift?\e"
MG0220010,"\h(«Sailor»)They don't stand a chance. 
Someone better tell their parents where they
are.\e"
MG0220011,"\h(«Don»)Kid, that's no ordinary sky rift… \e"
MG0220012,"\h(«Don»)During the war, this cape was discovered…
And this city was built.\e"
MG0220013,"\h(«Don»)This place is the edge of the world. If you try
and go any further east, you'll be killed.
Hundreds of men… good men… have died tryin'.\e"
MG0220014,"\h(«Don»)But, there's always a few fools that don't 
heed the warnin's. The Dark Rift 
usually claims 'em…\e"
MG0220015,"\h(«Don»)Some of the best sailors from all over the world
tried to cross the Dark Rift. 
They came from everywhere…\e"
MG0220016,"\h(«Don»)One by one they tried to pass through 
the Dark Rift. All of them failed.\e"
MG0220017,"\h(«Don»)The ships that enter the Dark Rift are either 
pushed away by the winds…\e"
MG0220018,"\h(«Don»)…or they get sucked in, never to return.\e"
MG0220019,"\h(«Don»)My crew and I lost our ship. We were lucky to
survive. After a while, sailors stopped comin'.\e"
MG0220020,"\h(«Don»)All we do now is sit around here, and wait to
die…\e"
MG0220021,"\h(«Sailor»)Some things are just impossible, kid. Why don't
you just go back to wherever you came from and
have your mommy tell you bedtime stories.\e"
MG0220022,"\h(«Aika»)What's wrong with you people?!
You've thrown your lives away! 
Don't you care about anything?! \e"
MG0220023,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, let's go!
We're just wasting our time here.\e"
MG0220024,"\h(«Vyse»)Thanks for telling me about the Dark Rift… 
Before I go, I just want to say that I've 
never met a more pitiful bunch in my life.\e"
MG0220025,"\h(«Vyse»)If you lose sight of one dream, replace it with
another. Think about how much you could have
accomplished in the time that you've spent here.\e"
MG0220026,"\h(«Vyse»)Just because you couldn't cross the Dark Rift, 
are you just going to sit here for the rest 
of your life?\e"
MG0220027,"\h(«Vyse»)Because you tried something once and failed, are
you going to throw the rest of your life away?\e"
MG0220028,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a whole world out there to see!
Don't you have any desire to sail again?\e"
MG0220029,\h(«Don»)……\e
MG0220030,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina, what is it?\e"
MG0220031,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse! Aika!
Come to the port! Quickly!\e"
MG0220032,\h(«Fina»)The Armada is coming!!!\e
MG0220033,"\h(«Aika»)What?!
What are they doing here?!\e"
MG0220034,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika, let's move!
We should hurry back to the port.\e"
M07020000,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Heh… it's been many years since someone outside
of Nasr has stayed here.\e"
M07020001,"\h(«Innkeeper»)It's 280 gold for one night.
Do you want to stay?\e"
M07020002,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M07020003,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Well then, I'll prepare a room for you right
away.\e"
M07020004,"\h(«Innkeeper»)I hope you had a pleasant rest.
I do not know where your travels take you,
but may the Red Moon always watch over you.\c"
M07020005,"\h(«Innkeeper»)I see… well, there aren't any other places to
rest in this city. Perhaps you will change your
mind later. Have a nice day.\c"
M07020018,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Hey… you don't have enough money.
Come back when you do.\c"
M07020006,"\h(«Innkeeper»)I heard about you guys!
You defeated the Armada with 
just a single ship, right?\e"
M07020007,"\h(«Innkeeper»)The Valuans are our old enemies… you have won a
victory for us! Please… stay the night here!
For free, of course! You are heroes!!!\e"
M07020008,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M07020009,"\h(«Innkeeper»)You'll stay? I am honored…
May the Red Moon watch over you in your sleep…\e"
M07020010,"\h(«Innkeeper»)I once heard from a man that managed to survive
a shipwreck in the Dark Rift that there are
strange plants called “Lenautos.”\e"
M07020019,"\h(«Innkeeper»)He said that he survived by following the paths
on which these things grew. I wonder what they
look like…\c"
M07020011,"\h(«Innkeeper»)I see… that's too bad.
Well then, I hope that the Red Moon watches
over your journeys.\c"
M07020012,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Hey, you're the Air Pirates that defeated the
Armada a little while back!\e"
M07020013,"\h(«Innkeeper»)The Valuans are our old enemies… you have won a
victory for us! Please… stay the night here!
For free, of course! You are heroes!!!\e"
M07020014,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M07020015,"\h(«Innkeeper»)You'll stay? I am honored…
Please, rest well…\e"
M07020016,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Did you sleep well?
Please, if the winds of fate ever blow your ship
this way, do not hesitate to stay here again…\c"
M07020017,"\h(«Innkeeper»)I see… Well, I do not know what fate has in
store for you, but I hope all goes well.\c"
M07030000,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)Just looking at this fortified lighthouse, you 
can see how important this city was to Valua…\e"
M07030001,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)But now, it's nothing more than just a giant 
tower of metal… broken cannons and all.\e"
M07030002,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)Well, I suppose people are the same. If you're 
not constantly brushing up your skills, you'll 
start to get rusty, just like this old tower…\e"
M07030003,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)Well, we're the same as the scrap metal you see
here… nothing but useless rust. Damn you, you 
big piece of junk!\c"
M07030004,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)Well, we're the same as the scrap metal you see
here… nothing but useless rust. Damn you, you 
big piece of junk!\c"
M07030005,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)Gregorio?
How is that old Admiral doing, anyway?\e"
M07030006,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)He was such a great defensive strategist. Even
in Valua, he was known as “Admiral Ironwall.”\e"
M07030007,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)Oh, it's you guys.
I saw your fight with the Armada from the port.\e"
M07030008,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)If the cannons of the lighthouse weren't all 
broken and rusted, I would've joined in the 
fight.\e"
M07030009,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)I've been cleaning up the tower and trying to 
fix the cannons so they work again. That'd make 
this place a great tourist attraction!\e"
M07030010,"\h(«Degenerate Ex-Valuan Soldier»)But these cannons won't work, no matter what I 
try to do! Pieces of junk!!\c"
M07050000,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I left Maramba with a sailor I was in love 
with. We were planning on moving to a country 
east of here…\e"
M07050001,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)But, we heard that the Dark Rift is impossible
to cross… and he changed…\e"
M07050002,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)And then one day, he met another girl and 
disappeared. He didn't even bother to say 
goodbye.\e"
M07050003,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I was foolish.
I fell for such a childish man and threw away a 
good life…\e"
M07050004,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)And I… I left my mother behind. She worked so 
hard to take care of me as a child…
I wonder how she is doing…\e"
M07050005,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)You say that you saw the Armada at sea?
Are you sure you weren't just seeing things?\e"
M07050006,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Are you guys serious?
You plan on fighting the Armada?
How do you expect to win with just one ship?\e"
M07050007,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)You guys are something else.
I can't believe you took on the Armada alone and
won.\e"
M07050008,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)If anyone can get through the Dark Rift, it
will be you. I'm praying for your success!\c"
M07050009,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I heard you guys made it through the Dark Rift!!
I knew you'd be able to do it!\e"
M07050010,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I have confidence in your abilities… so I have
a favor to ask of you. I would like you to
listen to my story first.\e"
M07050011,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Many years ago, I eloped and came here with a 
sailor that I had fallen in love with.\e"
M07050012,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)But, he found another woman and ran off with
her… I can't believe how foolish I was to trust
him.\e"
M07050013,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)But, I've accepted my fate. It's not myself that
I'm worried about… it's… my mother. I left her
behind in Maramba.\e"
M07050014,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)If you ever have a chance to stop by Maramba…
could you visit the Kabal Skewer shop?\e"
M07050015,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I… I want her to forgive her foolish daughter…
And I want her to know that not a day has passed
that I haven't thought of her… \e"
M07050016,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)If you ever have a chance to stop by Maramba… 
could you visit the Kabal Skewer shop?\e"
M07050017,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I… I want her to forgive her foolish daughter…
And I want her to know that not a day has passed
that I haven't thought of her… \e"
M07050018,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)What? You went to Maramba and spoke with my 
mother?! Wh, what did she say?!\e"
M07050019,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)…I see.
I guess you can't expect her to forgive such a 
selfish daughter so easily…\e"
M07050020,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)But, I was telling the truth when I said that 
I've never stopped thinking about her…\e"
M07050021,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)And my mother isn't young anymore… I worry
about her health. What can I do?\e"
M07050022,"\h(«Aika»)Hm… that lady seemed real hard-headed, though…
I wonder if there really is anything that
we can do.\e"
M07050023,"\h(«Fina»)Perhaps if we can somehow prove to your mother
that you haven't stopped thinking about her all
these years…\e"
M07050024,"\h(«Aika»)Prove to her?
Hm… Now, if only there was something we could
show her… something to prove it…\e"
M07050025,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)…I know a way!
There's one thing I can show her to prove it!\e"
M07050026,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Kabal Skewers! When I was little, my mother
would try and teach me her special Kabal Skewer
recipe.\e"
M07050027,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah! And if you can make a Kabal Skewer using
her recipe, it'll show your mom that you haven't
forgotten what she taught you!\e"
M07050028,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Would you mind waiting for a little bit? I'm 
going to make some Kabal Skewers!\e"
M07050029,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)It's done.
If you can get my mother to eat this, I'm sure 
she'll understand how I feel.\e"
M07050030,\h( )You received 1 “Kabal Skewer.”\e
M07050031,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Please make sure that you get my Kabal Skewer to
my mother in Maramba. I'm begging you…\c"
M07050032,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)What?! You ate my Kabal Skewer?
Oh, well…\e"
M07050033,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Here… I made another one.
Please bring it to my mother in Maramba.\e"
M07050034,\h( )You received 1 “Kabal Skewer.”\e
M07050035,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)You brought the Kabal Skewer to my mother in 
Maramba? What did she say?!\e"
M07050036,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)…Huh?
She said that the Kabal Skewer that I made
didn't taste the same as hers?\e"
M07050037,"\h(«Aika»)Um… she said that it smelled funny, it wasn't 
spiced correctly, and the quality of the meat 
you used is different.\e"
M07050038,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)…She noticed, huh? There's no way I can
duplicate my mother's Kabal Skewers with the
ingredients in this town…\e"
M07050039,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I remember exactly how to cook it.
But I don't have the same ingredients
and spices… What should I do?\e"
M07050040,\h(«Vyse»)Tell us what you need. We'll bring it to you.\e
M07050041,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Really?!
That would be a great help!
Here's what I need…\e"
M07050042,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I'll need “Gentum” for the scent,
“Khale” for seasoning, and “Kabal” meat.\e"
M07050043,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Would you bring these three ingredients to me?
If I have these, I know I will be able to make 
my mother's special Kabal Skewer…\e"
M07050044,"\h(«Aika»)“Gentum,” “Khale,” and “Kabal?” Leave it to us!\e"
M07050045,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Remember, it's “Gentum,” “Khale,” and “Kabal!”
Please bring them to me as soon as you find them
all!\c"
M07050046,\h(«Tavernkeep»)What?! You found all three ingredients?\e
M07050047,"\h(«Vyse»)Yup.
Here you go… some Gentum, Khale, and Kabal.\e"
M07050048,"\h( )You gave “Gentum,” “Khale,” and “Kabal” away.\e"
M07050049,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Yes! This is it!
With these ingredients, I'll be able to make my
mother's special Kabal Skewer!\e"
M07050050,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Just wait here…
I'll make some Kabal Skewers!\e"
M07050051,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Thanks for waiting!
Would you please bring this to my mother in 
Maramba now?\e"
M07050052,\h( )You received 1 “Mom's Skewer.”\e
M07050053,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)This time, the Kabal Skewer should be perfect.
Please bring it to my mother in Maramba.\e"
M07050054,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)What?! You ate my Kabal Skewer?!
Oh, well… I suppose I can just make another…\e"
M07050055,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Alright, it's done.
Now please… make sure and bring this one to 
my mother!\e"
M07050056,\h( )You received 1 “Mom's Skewer.”\e
M07050057,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Did you bring the Kabal Skewer to my mother in 
Maramba like I asked? What did she say?!\e"
M07050058,"\h(«Aika»)She said it was almost perfect! Well, actually, 
she said you could probably cook it for about a 
minute longer, but the taste was perfect!\e"
M07050059,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Really?
I'm so happy…
I'm sure my mother has forgiven me now!\e"
M07050060,\h(«Tavernkeep»)I can't thank you people enough!\e
M07050061,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Please… take this.
It's a token of my gratitude…\e"
M07050062,\h( )You received 1 “Abirik Cham.”\e
M07050063,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)If you're ever in the area, please don't 
hesitate to come and visit me!\c"
M07050064,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)If you're ever in the area, please don't 
hesitate to come and visit me!\c"
M07050065,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)My mother came all this way to come see me. She
spent the night last night, and we stayed up all
evening catching up on each other's lives.\e"
M07050066,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I owe everything to you people. I can't thank 
you enough.\c"
M07050067,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)I added my mother's special Kabal Skewer to the
menu. It's become quite popular.\e"
M07050068,\h(«Tavernkeep»)Here… take this. Go on… it's free of charge.\e
M07050069,\h( )You received 1 “Mom's Skewer.”\c
M07050070,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Let me know whenever you finish your Kabal
Skewer. I'll cook another one for you, okay?\e"
M07060000,"\h(«Pitiful Sailor»)You're not from around here, are ya?\e"
M07060001,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, we just came into town and we were
wondering if someone here could help us.\e"
M07060002,"\h(«Pitiful Sailor»)So you came to me… 
Well, that's just great…\e"
M07060003,"\h(«Don»)By the way, the name is Don. Now ask me your
question and be on your way.\e"
M07060004,"\h(«Vyse»)You know that sky rift to the east… 
How do you get through it?\e"
M07060005,"\h(«Don»)You seriously want to try and get through that 
thing?
Give it up, kid.\e"
M07060006,"\h(«Don»)I swear, kid. You're persistent…
I'll tell you what…\e"
M07060007,"\h(«Don»)If you guys can get through the Dark Rift and
make it back, I'll start sailing again.\c"
M07060008,"\h(«Don»)V, Vyse!!! It's you!!!
Y… you actually made it through the Dark Rift?!\e"
M07060009,"\h(«Vyse»)Yup. And I saw everything that was beyond it, 
too.\e"
M07060010,"\h(«Don»)You really know how to rub it in, don't you!
You know how much I wanted to see what was on
the other side!!\e"
M07060011,"\h(«Vyse»)Don, it's still not too late.
Why don't you come with us? We can sail 
together.\e"
M07060012,"\h(«Don»)Heh… Well, there isn't much I can do other than
sail, and I sure haven't done that in a while, 
either… \e"
M07060013,"\h(«Don»)But if it's a sailor you want, it's a sailor 
you'll get! Let's go, Captain!\e"
M07060014,\h( )Don has joined your crew as a “Helmsman.”\c
M07070000,\h(«Former Sailor»)Do you know what “Esparanza” really means?\e
M07070001,"\h(«Former Sailor»)It means “hope.” Hopeful sailors from all over 
gathered here to try and get to the east.\e"
M07070002,"\h(«Former Sailor»)But now, this city is filled with nothing but
despair!
Oh, the irony!\c"
M07070003,"\h(«Former Sailor»)I guess there are still naïve little kids that
talk of nothing but false dreams!\e"
M07070004,"\h(«Former Sailor»)Heh heh… We have a saying here… the Dark Rift
is not a place to be taken “lightly”.\e"
M07070005,"\h(«Former Sailor»)I'm sorry!! I've been waiting forever for some 
newcomers to tell that joke to.
Hahahahahaha!!!!\c"
M07070006,"\h(«Former Sailor»)I don't believe it… You guys actually defeated 
the Armada!\e"
M07070007,"\h(«Former Sailor»)And while you're at it, could you teach my wife
a lesson or two? She's probably tougher than
the whole Armada!\c"
M07070008,"\h(«Former Sailor»)Wait… you not only got past the Dark Rift,
but you also sailed around the whole world?\e"
M07070009,"\h(«Former Sailor»)Me? Nah… I'm fine here. I just want to stay 
here and drink loqua and live my life in 
ignorant bliss!\c"
M07100000,"\h(«Young Woman»)Hey, it's the newcomers. Let me guess… you
came here hoping to get to the legendary lands
to the east, right?\e"
M07100001,"\h(«Young Woman»)My parents were the same way. When I was just a
little girl, my parents brought me here with
plans of going to the lands to the east.\e"
M07100002,"\h(«Young Woman»)Our ship sank and I've been here ever since. But
what a waste… the rest of the world will never
be able to see how pretty I've become! Hahaha…\e"
M07100003,"\h(«Young Woman»)…Huh? My parents?
They went down with our ship… killed by that
maelstrom.\c"
M07100004,"\h(«Young Woman»)Hey, don't worry about it.
They were foolish for thinking they could get
through the Dark Rift anyway.\c"
M07100005,"\h(«Young Woman»)I'd give up on trying to get through the Dark
Rift if I were you… if you don't want to leave
your loved ones behind, that is.\c"
M07100006,"\h(«Young Woman»)You're actually going to try and get through
the Dark Rift?!\e"
M07100007,"\h(«Young Woman»)Well, I wouldn't worry too much. If anyone can
get through that thing, it would be you guys.
Good luck! I pray for your safety.\c"
M07100008,"\h(«Young Woman»)Even the other men of the town have seen you
guys fight and are starting to regain their
courage!\c"
M07100009,"\h(«Young Woman»)I wish I could find a guy like you!
Thank you for everything you've done for us!\c"
M07110000,"\h(«Old Lady»)All of our problems are from foolish people who 
try to follow their dreams, but fail. Just keep
your feet on the ground and you'll be alright.\e"
M07110001,"\h(«Old Lady»)It's because people thought of going to the
far-off lands to the east that they're stuck
here, unable to go anywhere else. The fools…\e"
M07110002,"\h(«Old Lady»)Do you have to go?
I swear… young people… I don't know if they're
brave or if they're just stupid.\e"
M07110003,"\h(«Old Lady»)Well, just try to your heart's content. It's
not like anything I say will stop you anyway.\e"
M07110004,"\h(«Old Lady»)Ever since you guys came back, all of the men of
the town have been a little inspired. They're
gaining back the old fire that they lost.\e"
M07110005,"\h(«Old Lady»)Maybe losing hope because you're afraid of the
future is the same as living life with your eyes
closed because you're afraid to see the truth…\e"
M07130000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant»)Ah, welcome, welcome!
Would you like to see my wares?\e"
M07130001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy or sell items.”
“Talk to the merchant.”
“Leave.”\e"
M07130002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant»)I've heard that there are very rare fish that
live in and around the Dark Rift!\e"
M07130003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant»)In fact, there are fish that haven't changed
since the days before the Old World! I wonder
what they look like…\c"
M07130004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant»)Thank you!
Please come again!\e"
M07140000,"\h(«Former Sailor»)The Dark Rift is a giant sky rift. It's an evil
maelstrom.\e"
M07140001,"\h(«Former Sailor»)I have heard that once you're inside the vortex,
everything goes a little strange…\e"
M07140002,"\h(«Former Sailor»)There's no light… and compasses don't work.
Basically, it's easy to lose track of where you 
came from.\e"
M07140003,"\h(«Former Sailor»)Well, at least that's what some of the survivors
said. I don't know if they're telling the truth
or not, though…\c"
M07140004,"\h(«Former Sailor»)I guess I wouldn't doubt it…
Everyone has been defeated by the ultimate
obstacle, the Dark Rift.\e"
M07140005,"\h(«Former Sailor»)There's no way to get past that sky rift.
All that is left in this town is a bunch of
fools who are letting their lives pass them by.\c"
M07140006,"\h(«Former Sailor»)I heard… you guys are going to take on Valua?
Well, good luck… just don't get yourselves 
killed out there.\e"
M07140007,"\h(«Former Sailor»)I'll tell you this before you go out there, 
though. Once the battle has started, you can't 
depend on anything except your own strength.\e"
M07140008,"\h(«Former Sailor»)Well, well… you did quite nicely there kid.
You're quite strong, but that ship of yours…
it's amazing.\e"
M07140009,"\h(«Former Sailor»)Who knows?
With a ship like that, you just might be able to
make it through the Dark Rift…\e"
M07140010,"\h(«Former Sailor»)We may have lost our youth and our dreams here…
but perhaps you can relive them for us.\e"
M07140011,"\h(«Former Sailor»)I heard that not only did you get past the Dark
Rift, but you sailed around the world. That's
quite impressive…\e"
M07140012,"\h(«Former Sailor»)Heh… My body is getting restless! Maybe I'll 
take to sailing again! Well, if you ever see me 
out there sailing, be sure to say hi!\e"
M04120000,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)I came here from far away to help my daughter
out with her store.
Well, I'm happy that she's doing alright.\e"
M04120001,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)The Kabal Skewer that she made last time wasn't
cooked properly. She has the spicing down, but
she still doesn't know how to cook it!\e"
M04120002,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)Well, I have to stay here and teach this foolish
girl how to cook my Kabal Skewer properly before
I can return to Maramba!\e"
M04120003,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)Well, I have to stay here and teach this foolish
girl how to cook my Kabal Skewer properly before
I can return to Maramba!\e"
Ms018a000,"\h(«Vyse»)A shipwreck? Or was it just abandoned?
It looks like it's been sitting here for a very
long time…\c"
Ms018a001,"\h(«Vyse»)That's a pretty old box.
There's some drinks and canned food inside,
but I don't know if they're still any good.\c"
Ms018a002,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a lot of drinks and food.
It looks like we can look forward to
a good meal.\c"
Ms018a003,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a gas tank. There's a date stamp, but it's
been partially rubbed off. Looks like it's
empty, though. Well, it's all rusted up, too.\c"
Ms018a004,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a gas tank. There's a date stamp, but it's
been partially rubbed off. Looks like it's
empty, though. Well, it's all rusted up, too.\c"
Ms018a005,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, this bed looks comfortable.
It's old, but fluffy. It seems like
it's hung out in the sun every day.\c"
Ms018a006,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a lot of old, yellowed books.
They're all about navigation, and
the Dark Rift.\c"
Ms018a007,"\h(«Vyse»)Ugh, the bed's covered with dust.
I guess it doesn't get used much.
I wish they'd at least clean it, though.\c"
Ms018a008,"\h(«Vyse»)A nice, fluffy mattress,
and clean, white sheets.
They're a little old, but nice.\c"
Ms018a009,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a lot of dust here.
Not only do they not get many guests,
it doesn't even seem like they want any.\c"
Ms018a010,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a brand new comb
and shaving set in the drawer.\c"
Ms018a011,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a half-finished letter
in the drawer.\e"
Ms018a012,"\h(«Vyse»)“I was able to trace my brother
as far as Esparanza.”\e"
Ms018a013,"\h(«Vyse»)“Perhaps everyone was right, and my brother
headed into the Dark Rift…”
… The letter ends here.\c"
Ms018a014,"\h(«Vyse»)I suppose this is a picture from back when this
town was still… lively. It's hard to imagine
that a time like that existed here…\c"
Ms018a015,"\h(«Vyse»)It's picture of when the town was more lively.
I guess the town is going to start looking more
like this again.\c"
Ms018a016,"\h(«Vyse»)… It's completely rusted.
This would probably explode if
you tried to fire it.\c"
Ms018a017,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, a treasure chest… Damn, I guess not.
It's just being used as a toolbox.\c"
Ms018a018,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this?
It's full of loqua and snacks.
Looks like someone isn't eating right.\c"
Ms018a019,"\h(«Vyse»)A campfire indoors?
This is an… interesting
way to cook food.\c"
Ms018a020,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a tattered Valuan flag… That's almost…
ironic. Especially considering that this place
started falling apart after Valua pulled out.\c"
Ms018a021,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… A gas tank, huh? Those really aren't that
common anymore. Maybe they don't use Moon Stones
as fuel around here…\c"
Ms018a022,"\h(«Vyse»)There's an old newspaper at the bottom
of the box. “The Birth of Prince Enrique!”
…Whoa. That's an old newspaper.\c"
Ms018a023,"\h(«Vyse»)There's some old bottles and flasks. It doesn't
look like they've been used in a long time.\c"
Ms018a024,"\h(«Vyse»)There's some old bottles and flasks. It doesn't
look like they've been used in a long time.\c"
Ms018a025,"\h(«Vyse»)Maybe there's some old invoices and
papers… and a few dead insects in
between the sheets.\c"
Ms018a026,"\h(«Vyse»)There's some recent receipts in the pile of
papers. It looks like trade has started to pick
up around here again.\c"
Ms018a027,"\h(«Vyse»)I should probably try to collect information
about the Dark Rift while I'm here.
We'll leave after that.\c"
Ms018a028,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
