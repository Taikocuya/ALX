ME0250000,"\h(«Captured Man»)Huh?
Who are you?\e"
ME0250001,"\h(«Vyse»)I'm Vyse.
Are you Isapa?\e"
ME0250002,"\h(«Captured Man»)No, it appears you have mistaken me for someone
else. My name is Centime.\e"
ME0250003,\h(«Aika»)Then you're Hans' father!\e
ME0250004,"\h(«Centime»)You know Hans?! 
Then you must have been to the village
in Horteka!\e"
ME0250005,"\h(«Centime»)That's where my wife and children are… 
Everyone was okay, right?\e"
ME0250006,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah, they were doing just fine.
But, you should worry about yourself right now.\e"
ME0250007,"\h(«Centime»)Oh, I'm okay. When I refused to help Valua,
they threw me into these dungeons.
I've been here for quite a while.\e"
ME0250008,"\h(«Centime»)You were looking for someone named Isapa,
correct? If so, then you'll need to venture
further into these mines. I think I can help.\e"
ME0250009,"\h(«Centime»)There are elevators scattered throughout the 
mines. You will need to use them to reach the 
other areas. I can get them working.\e"
ME0250010,"\h(«Aika»)Woohoo! 
Wow, Centime, you're amazing!\e"
ME0250011,"\h(«Centime»)Why, thank you.\e"
ME0250012,"\h(«Centime»)I must advise you, proceed with caution… there 
are all sorts of traps. I will travel ahead and 
see if I can disarm them for you.\e"
ME0250013,"\h(«Vyse»)Thank you!
You've been a great help to us already.\e"
ME0250014,"\h(«Centime»)It's the least I can do for you.
You rescued me, remember?
I'm sure we'll meet again. Good luck!\e"
M01110000,"\h(«Vyse»)A Valuan soldier…
I guess this is the Valuan stronghold.\c"
M01110001,"\h(«Vyse»)An Ixa'takan…
Valuans are probably forcing them to
mine for Moon Stones…\c"
M01110002,"\h(«Vyse»)This door has been welded shut…
It looks like they're serious about
keeping the Ixa'takans in here.\e"
M01110003,"\h(«Vyse»)Sorry, guys, but just hang in a little while
longer. I'll free all of you… I promise. I'll
send those Valuans back to Valua…\c"
M01110004,"\h(«Vyse»)Damn… This door's welded shut… It doesn't look
like I'm going to get any further this way.\c"
M01110005,"\h(«Vyse»)Damn this shutter…
It won't budge at all.\c"
M01110006,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a big shutter…
But, it doesn't look like it going to open.\c"
M01110007,"\h(«Vyse»)The door closed again. This is just great.
Why do I get the strange feeling that someone's
leading me somewhere…?\c"
M01110008,"\h( )Perfect devices and perfect machines
are far more sacred than human life!
                            De Loco\c"
M01110009,"\h( )Only perfect devices are worth anything!
Imperfect devices are garbage!
                             De Loco\c"
M01110010,"\h( )Useless machines should be thrown away.
Useless people should be executed!
                               De Loco\c"
M01110011,"\h( )Kill any Ixa'takan who tries
to resist!
                     De Loco\c"
M01110012,"\h( )A Moon Stone pebble is worth
a gallon of blood!
                      De Loco\c"
M01110013,"\h( )Treat my machines with respect,
or you'll be drawn and quartered!
                         De Loco\c"
M01110014,"\h( )Inside this mine,
I am the law!
           De Loco\c"
M01110015,"\h(«Vyse»)Why do all these doors keep closing on me?
What's going on here?\c"
M01110016,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmph. Nope, it won't move.
It looks like the electricity's been cut.\c"
M01110017,"\h(«Captured Man»)Hm? You don't look like you're a Valuan…
Who might you be?\e"
M01110018,"\h(«Vyse»)It closed again…
It almost seems like someone's watching
what we do, and closing the doors…\c"
M01110019,"\h(«Vyse»)Nope… it won't open.
Looks like it's locked.\c"
M01110020,"\h(«Alfonso»)Uh… ugh…
W… Why do these things always happen to me?\c"
M01110021,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01110022,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01110023,"\h(«Ixa'takan Slave»)I haven't seen you around here before.
Were you brought here recently?\e"
M01110024,"\h(«Ixa'takan Slave»)A man named De Loco made this mine.
It's filled with nasty traps.\e"
M01110025,"\h(«Ixa'takan Slave»)There's trap doors all over the place.
And remember, a circle doesn't always mean
it's the right way.\e"
M01110026,"\h(«Ixa'takan Slave»)If you can see below,
look down. If there's a mining cart,
it'll come back here.\c"
M01110027,"\h(«Ixa'takan Slave»)There's trap doors all over the place.
And remember, a circle doesn't always mean
it's the right way.\e"
M01110028,"\h(«Ixa'takan Slave»)If you can see below,
look down. If there's a mining cart,
it'll come back here.\c"
