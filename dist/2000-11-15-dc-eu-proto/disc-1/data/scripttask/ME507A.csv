MA5070000,"\h(«Belleza»)Hahaha…
Meet my flagship, the Lynx.\e"
MA5070001,"\h(«Belleza»)Now, I will show you the true power of the
Imperial Armada! My Magic Cannon will
take care of that little ship of yours!\c"
MA5070002,"\h(«Drachma»)Damn…
The lady admiral's good. It's almost as if
she can read our every move…\e"
MA5070003,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! I can't find any openings! Her defense
is too good!
What should we do?!\e"
MA5070004,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Try and get behind her ship!”
“Turn hard and try and catch her off guard.”\c"
MA5070005,"\h(«Aika»)…Huh?
Where'd she go?!\e"
MA5070006,"\h(«Drachma»)Dammit, boy! You let her get behind us!
Now she's got a clear shot at our backside!\e"
MA5070007,"\h(«Belleza»)Hahaha…
I didn't think you'd be so predictable,
handsome. It's almost… disappointing.\e"
MA5070008,"\h(«Belleza»)Battles aren't always won with brute strength.
Sometimes, knowing how to read your enemy can
be the key to an easy victory.\c"
MA5070009,\h(«Belleza»)Hmm… That ship's quicker than it looks.\e
MA5070010,"\h(«Belleza»)They may have surprised me this time, but I
always have a backup plan. Preparation is
one of the keys to victory, handsome…\c"
MA5070011,"\h(«Vyse»)Damn…
She's too good! I can't find any
openings!\e"
MA5070012,"\h(«Drachma»)Boy, we need to get into a good position
to fire the Harpoon Cannon!\e"
MA5070013,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Wait and see what she does.”
“Set engines to full speed and get behind her.”\c"
MA5070014,"\h(«Vice Captain»)Lady Belleza!
The enemy vessel is continuing
along its present course!\e"
MA5070015,"\h(«Belleza»)Hahaha… What's wrong, handsome?
Couldn't think of anything to do?
If you're not going to do anything, I will.\c"
MA5070016,"\h(«Vice Captain»)Lady Belleza, the enemy vessel is
trying to circle around us at what
appears to be their top speed!\e"
MA5070017,"\h(«Belleza»)Their ship may be fast, but we only need
to ensure that they do not get into position
to fire that Harpoon Cannon.\c"
MA5070018,"\h(«Aika»)This isn't fair!! Why won't she just sit still
like everyone else does?! How does she expect us
to hit her with the Harpoon Cannon like this?!\e"
MA5070019,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Head straight upward!”
“Bring the Little Jack to a complete stop!”\c"
MA5070020,"\h(«Vyse»)Maybe we can catch her off guard if we
pull into a steep climb…\e"
MA5070021,"\h(«Aika»)B, but…
That means they'll have a clear shot
at our hull!\e"
MA5070022,"\h(«Vyse»)That's why she'll never think that
we'd do it. We need to try something
completely unexpected!\c"
MA5070023,"\h(«Belleza»)……!?
Where did they go?!
Vice Captain! What's going on?!\e"
MA5070024,"\h(«Vice Captain»)Y, yes Lady Belleza!
They pulled into a steep climb and managed
to get behind us!\e"
MA5070025,"\h(«Belleza»)What…?
I can't believe they would risk
leaving their hull open like that…\c"
MA5070026,"\h(«Vice Captain»)Lady Belleza!
The enemy vessel has come
to a complete stop!\e"
MA5070027,"\h(«Belleza»)What!? Why would…
Vice Captain! Put the engines into full
reverse! We must not let them get behind us!!\e"
MA5070028,"\h(«Vice Captain»)It's too late!
We've already passed them! They've
managed to get behind us, Admiral!\e"
MA5070029,"\h(«Belleza»)Damn! I thought they were relying on their
speed… I can't believe they just pulled into
a complete stop like that. Very good, handsome…\c"
MA5070030,"\h(«Belleza»)……!?
Where did they go?!
Vice Captain! What's going on?!\e"
MA5070031,"\h(«Vice Captain»)Y, yes Lady Belleza!
They pulled into a steep climb and managed
to get behind us!\e"
MA5070032,"\h(«Belleza»)What…?
I can't believe they would risk
leaving their hull open like that…\c"
MA5070033,"\h(«Vyse»)Now's our chance! Her defenses are breaking
down! It's time to open fire!\c"
MA5070034,"\h(«Belleza»)Vice Captain! What just happened?!
We were on their tail,
and now suddenly he's behind us!\e"
MA5070035,"\h(«Vice Captain»)Well, um…
The enemy vessel suddenly stopped,
and we passed them.\e"
MA5070036,"\h(«Belleza»)What?!
Their speed was their biggest advantage…
And you mean to tell me they just stopped?!\e"
MA5070037,"\h(«Belleza»)Damn… He's not as predictable as I thought.
I can't keep fighting him this way. I need
to take him out quickly…\c"
MA5070038,"\h(«Vyse»)Now's our chance! Her defenses are breaking
down! It's time to open fire!\c"
