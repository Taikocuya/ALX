Ms033b000,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow… This is a really old engine. It's so
loud… And it looks like it's about to shake
itself to pieces. I hope it's sturdy enough…\c"
Ms033b200,"\h(«Vyse»)With the engine that we took from Belleza's
ship, the Little Jack is quite powerful. And
it's not as loud as it used to be, too.\c"
Ms033b100,"\h(«Vyse»)The engine doesn't look like it's going to
hold up much longer!!\c"
Ms033b001,\h(«Vyse»)The door's locked. I wonder what's in here…\c
Ms033b002,"\h(«Vyse»)This is the Captain's room. He goes in here
to be by himself every once in a while, but the
door is always locked.\c"
Ms033b102,"\h(«Vyse»)This is the Captain's room… but I don't hear
him snoring like usual. I wonder if he's awake…\e"
Ms033b103,"\h(«Vyse»)Captain?
Captain… It's Vyse. You awake?\e"
Ms033b104,"\h(«Vyse»)… There's no response.
I wonder where he is?\c"
Ms033b105,"\h(«Vyse»)We have to hurry and get to the engine room!
There's no time to go walking around the
Captain's room!\c"
Ms033b003,"\h(«Vyse»)This looks like it's the storage area. I can
smell dried fruits and meat through the cracks
in the door… But the door's locked.\c"
Ms033b004,"\h(«Vyse»)This used to be the storage area, but the
Captain converted it into bedroom. But, I still
have to sleep in the engine room…\c"
Ms033b106,"\h(«Vyse»)This used to be the storage area, but Aika and
Fina now use it as their bedroom.\e"
Ms033b107,\h(«Aika»)Ungh… I… swear… I didn't… steal… anything…\e
Ms033b108,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha…
Sounds like Aika's talking
in her sleep again.\c"
Ms033b109,"\h(«Vyse»)There's no time to go wandering around! We have
to hurry to the engine room!!\c"
Ms033b005,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a hammock put up here.
Is this where the old guy sleeps?\c"
Ms033b006,"\h(«Vyse»)This is the hammock that I've been sleeping in.
The engine is kinda loud, but I've gotten used
to it by now.\c"
Ms033b110,"\h(«Vyse»)I've actually grown to like this hammock…
but I guess I'll never sleep in it again…\c"
Ms033b007,"\h(«Vyse»)It's an emergency lifeboat. I guess even on a
ship as small as this one, it's always best to
have a few lifeboats ready…\c"
Ms033b008,\h(«Vyse»)Ngh… It won't open. It must be locked.\c
Ms033b009,"\h(«Vyse»)Later that night…
My heart was racing with excitement. I was too
anxious to get even a wink of sleep.\e"
Ms033b010,"\h(«Vyse»)Rhaknam is nearby…
That's all I could think as I lie there,
trying to sleep.\c"
Ms033b011,"\h(«Vyse»)It doesn't look like I'm going to get any
shut-eye. Maybe I'll take a little walk to try
and calm myself down.\c"
