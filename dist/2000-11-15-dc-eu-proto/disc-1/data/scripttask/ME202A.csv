MA0120000,\h(«Fina»)It's so beautiful…\e
MA0120001,"\h(«Vyse»)I love it up here, it's so peaceful. I come up 
here to relax and watch the sunsets.\e"
MA0120002,"\h(«Vyse»)When I'm up here, I often wonder what lies 
beyond the sky…
Beyond the sunset…\e"
MA0120003,\h(«Fina»)Beyond… the sky…?\e
MA0120004,"\h(«Vyse»)Some say there're monsters. Others say there's
a maelstrom that either blows ships away,
or pulls them in… and they're never seen again.\e"
MA0120005,"\h(«Vyse»)And there are others that just say it's…
impossible…\e"
MA0120006,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MA0120007,\h(«Vyse»)I want to know what's out there…\e
MA0120008,"\h(«Vyse»)Besides, I don't like giving up on anything
without giving it my best shot.\e"
MA0120009,"\h(«Vyse»)Someday, I will be the captain of my own ship, 
I'll go beyond that sunset, and I'll see what's 
out there.\e"
MA0120010,"\h(«Aika»)Wow… I bet if you could go beyond the sunset,
the sky would look even more beautiful.\e"
MA0120011,\h(«Vyse·Aika»)Hey!!\e
MA0120012,\h(«Vyse»)…That was a Moon Stone!\e
MA0120013,\h(«Fina»)… a Moon Stone?\e
MA0120014,"\h(«Vyse»)…It landed on that island over there. 
I think that's Shrine Island.\e"
MA0120015,"\h(«Aika»)It's been a long time since we've seen a Moon 
Stone fall!\e"
MA0120016,\h(«Fina»)I don't understand. That was a Moon Stone?\e
MA0120017,"\h(«Aika»)That's right.
Fina, you've heard of Moon Stones before, right?\e"
MA0120018,"\h(«Aika»)They're pieces of rock that fall from the Moons.
They usually crash land on the islands. They're
a really powerful source of energy, too.\e"
MA0120019,"\h(«Aika»)We use them for all sorts of things.
They power our air ships and we can also forge 
weapons out of them.\e"
MA0120020,"\h(«Fina»)Oh, yes.
I know of Moon Stones.\e"
MA0120021,"\h(«Fina»)But, it's my first time seeing a Moon Stone 
actually fall from the sky.\e"
MA0120022,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\e"
MA0120023,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah, we should try to recover the Moon Stone. 
Let's go first thing tomorrow.\e"
MA0120024,\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Vyse! Aika! Fina!\e
MA0120025,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Dinner is ready!
Come on down!\e"
MA0120026,"\h(«Vyse»)Let's go, Fina.
You're going to eat with us, right?\e"
MA0120027,"\h(«Aika»)We're so lucky!!
I love your mom's cooking…\e"
MA0120028,"\h(«Aika»)Fina, let's go eat while it's still hot!\e"
MA0120029,"\h(«Fina»)Yes, thank you for your gracious offer.\e"
