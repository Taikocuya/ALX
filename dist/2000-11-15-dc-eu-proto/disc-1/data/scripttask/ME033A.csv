MB0030001,\h(«Vyse»)Ugh…\e
MB0030002,"\h( )Are you goin' to sleep all day?
Get up!\e"
MB0030003,\h(«Vyse»)Oh… my head…\e
MB0030004,\h(«Aika»)Uhhh…\e
MB0030005,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika, are you okay?\e"
MB0030007,\h(«Vyse»)……!\e
MB0030008,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Because of you two, Rhaknam got away! 
I was so close…\e"
MB0030009,"\h(«Vyse»)Rhaknam…?
Now I remember… that huge arcwhale
that blew our ship off course!\e"
MB0030010,"\h(«Vyse»)I thought we were finished, but you rescued us. 
Hey, thanks!\e"
MB0030011,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)“Thanks?!… Thanks!!?”, you say?!
Don't start with me!\e"
MB0030012,\h(«Aika»)Vyse!\e
MB0030013,"\h(«Vyse»)Owwwww…
I'm not sure why,
but I keep getting hurt today…\e"
MB0030014,"\h(«Aika»)Hey!!!
What are you doing, you crusty… err rusty… old
man?! He didn't do anything!\e"
MB0030015,"\h(«Man with the Artificial Arm»)Didn't do anythin'?! I've been chasin' after
that arcwhale for years!!!\e"
MB0030016,"\h(«Man with the Artificial Arm»)I was so close to finally capturin' him, but 
because of you kids, he got away!\e"
MB0030017,"\h(«Vyse»)I'm really sorry… That you didn't catch him… 
Really…\e"
MB0030018,"\h(«Man with the Artificial Arm»)Hrmph… Debris from your ship hit my sails… I'm
lucky my ship is still airborne. You kids were 
even luckier that I was here to grab you.\e"
MB0030019,"\h(«Man with the Artificial Arm»)I was working all mornin' tossin' what was left 
of your ship overboard. Now I'm stuck with the 
two of you.\e"
MB0030020,"\h(«Aika»)What!?
Our ship… was destroyed?\e"
MB0030021,"\h(«Man with the Artificial Arm»)Aye… Now, this isn't a passenger ship.
Everyone on board needs to pull their own 
weight.\e"
MB0030022,"\h(«Man with the Artificial Arm»)If you don't like it, you can jump off… I need 
to keep the load as light as possible anyway.\e"
MB0030023,\h(«Aika»)Wh… what?!\e
MB0030024,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh, great…
What kind of mess have we gotten ourselves
into?\e"
MB0040000,"\h(«Vyse»)Great, now I gotta move boxes all day… \e"
MB0040001,\h(«Vyse»)Ummph!\e
MB0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)What is in this thing, anyway?!\e"
MB0040003,"\h(«Vyse»)Sigh~…
I'm done, sir.\e"
MB0040004,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Alright, now on to the next chore.
Take the helm.\e"
MB0040005,"\h(«Vyse»)What?
Are you really letting me?\e"
MB0040006,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)I want to see how well you can sail.
If you can't sail, then you'll be loadin' boxes 
the rest of the trip!\e"
MB0040007,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow!
Most of my duties revolved around raiding, so I
hardly ever got to actually fly our old ship!\e"
MB0040008,"\h(«Vyse»)Well…
They're pretty old, but these gauges are in 
great shape!\e"
MB0040009,"\h(«Vyse»)And the wheel is so light! It's really
responsive, too! This ship must make really
tight turns.\e"
MB0040010,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Heh… For someone who's hardly ever been at the
helm of a ship this size, you seem to know quite
a bit, boy.\e"
MB0040011,"\h(«Vyse»)Hehe, I spent a lot of time on the bridge of the
Albatross, so I picked up a lot.\e"
MB0040012,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Good. Now let's see if you can actually sail.
Our destination is Sailor's Island, about 40 
leagues northeast from here.\e"
MB0040013,"\h(«Vyse»)Wait a minute.
You could at least tell me the name of this
ship… and yours while you're at it?\e"
MB0040014,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Hrmph.
The ship's called the Little Jack.
And I'm Drachma.\e"
MB0040015,"\h(«Drachma»)Alright, now stop foolin' around…
The sun is going to set soon!\e"
MB0040016,"\h(«Vyse»)Aye aye, Captain Drachma!
Little Jack, full speed ahead!\e"
MB0040017,\h( )Drachma has joined your party!\e
MB0040018,"\h( )Drachma has allowed you to use his
“Blue Moon Stone.”\e"
MB0080000,"\h(«Baltor»)Blast! You were lucky this time!
But I will hunt you down and have my revenge!\e"
MB0080001,"\h(«Baltor»)This I swear on the code of the Black Pirates! 
You will rue the day you ever crossed paths
with me! And somebody put out that fire!!!\e"
MB0080002,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, we did it!\e"
MB0080003,\h(«Vyse»)Yeah!\e
MB0080004,"\h(«Vyse»)Ow!
What'd you do that for, Captain?\e"
MB0080005,"\h(«Drachma»)We're not there yet, you idiot! Never take your 
hands off the wheel until we've come to a 
complete stop!\e"
MB0080006,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah, you idiot! Why don't you watch what you're
doing? It's a good thing Cap'n Drachma's here to
keep you in line.\e"
MB0080007,\h(«Vyse»)Aika… why you little…\e
MB0080008,"\h(«Aika»)Hahaha… I'm sorry! I just couldn't resist…
You just defeated Baltor the Scary, why don't
you lighten up a little bit?\e"
MB0080009,"\h(«Aika»)We're almost there!
Get ready!!!\e"
MB0110000,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, this looks like the box that the old man 
wanted me to get.\e"
MB0110001,"\h(«Vyse»)Urrrrgh!
What the…?!
What's in this thing?\e"
MB0110002,"\h(«Vyse»)Great, this guy is probably going to work us to 
death!\e"
MB0110003,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Hrmph…
You look like you've got a little more than 
lubber on your bones. What's your name, boy?\e"
MB0110004,\h(«Vyse»)My name is Vyse. I'm a Blue Rogue.\e
MB0110005,"\h(«Vyse»)I used to do this type of grunt work on the 
pirate ship.\e"
MB0110006,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)An Air Pirate, huh?
Well… and what exactly would two Air Pirates be
doin' sailin' alone?\e"
MB0110007,"\h(«Vyse»)Well…
We have our reasons.\e"
MB0110008,"\h(«Vyse»)… Sir.
We need to get to Valua. I beg of you, please 
take us there!\e"
MB0110009,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)… Valua, huh?
Explain.\e"
MB0110010,"\h(«Vyse»)… and that's why we have to get there
as soon as possible.
We need to save our friends.\e"
MB0110011,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Hrmph… tryin' to pick a fight with the Armada? 
You've got to be out of your mind, boy.\e"
MB0110012,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)I have no time to babysit you and your friend.
And I need to find Rhaknam again.
Try your luck with a different ship.\e"
MB0110013,"\h(«Vyse»)I see… it would really help if you could bring 
us, but we can't force you to.\e"
MB0110014,"\h(«Vyse»)By the way,
why exactly are you chasing Rhaknam, anyway?\e"
MB0110015,\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)……\e
MB0110016,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)There is no need to tell you.
And there is still one supply box left!
Get down into the hull and get movin'!\e"
MB0110017,"\h(«Vyse»)Great, I spill my guts, he keeps quiet… and
then makes me do more work! What's with this
guy?\e"
MB0140000,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Go down into the hull and bring the two supply 
boxes up to the bridge.\e"
MB0140001,"\h(«Vyse»)Bring two supply boxes to the bridge? 
No problem. I'll bring them right away!\e"
MB0140002,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, sir…
We were on our way to Valua when we were 
attacked. Where is this ship heading?\e"
MB0140003,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Where this ship is goin' is none of your 
concern. Now get moving!\e"
MB0140004,"\h(«Vyse»)I give up…
I don't really have time to be doing this!
But what other choice do I have?\e"
MD0010000,"\h(«Vyse»)There's the Red Moon…
We're entering Nasr airspace.\e"
MD0010001,"\h(«Aika»)Wow!
There's nothing here but sand!\e"
MD0010002,"\h(«Vyse»)So this is a desert…
I've heard sailors talk about them before,
but it's my first time actually seeing one.\e"
MD0010003,"\h(«Aika»)Now that you mention it,
I've heard sailors talking about them, too.\e"
MD0010004,"\h(«Aika»)They said that the Nasr deserts are so hot,
if you walk around in the sun too long,
your hair catches on fire!\e"
MD0010005,"\h(«Aika»)Everyone carries buckets of water around with
them, so they can put their friends' hair out.
And then…\e"
MD0010006,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh come on, Aika… you don't actually believe
those crazy stories. Sometimes I wonder what
goes on in that head of yours.\e"
MD0010007,"\h(«Aika»)Don't come crying to me when your head bursts
into flames… That glass eyepatch you wear will
intensify the sun's rays and fry your brain.\e"
MD0010008,"\h(«Aika»)…I'm just kidding, Vyse. It's just a story that
I heard a long time ago. I didn't really believe
it either… Hehe… But you can't be too careful.\e"
MD0010009,"\h(«Fina»)The Moon Stones that fall from the Red Moon
give off a great deal of heat.
It's too hot for most plants to survive.\e"
MD0010010,"\h(«Fina»)Because of this, the lands of Nasr have been
reduced to a barren wasteland.\e"
MD0010011,"\h(«Vyse»)I see… There isn't much down there besides sand
and rock. The Red Moon Crystal should be hidden
somewhere in the desert, right?\e"
MD0010012,"\h(«Fina»)That's right, Vyse.\e"
MD0010013,"\h(«Fina»)It is buried deep within the ancient Temple of
Pyrynn.\e"
MD0010014,"\h(«Aika»)An ancient temple? I'll bet there's all kinds of
treasure in there! Maybe some gold and gems and
magic stuff and nice clothes, and… and… stuff.\e"
MD0010015,"\h(«Aika»)If we find a bunch of treasure, we'll be rich!
We can go buy whatever we want!!!
What's the first thing you'd buy, Fina?\e"
MD0010016,\h(«Fina»)B… buy?\e
MD0010017,\h(«Fina»)Ummm…\e
MD0010018,"\h(«Fina»)Um…
What does that mean… exactly?\e"
MD0010019,"\h(«Aika»)What?!
Fina… you don't know what that means?!\e"
MD0010020,"\h(«Fina»)I… I'm terribly sorry.
I've never seen the rest of the world before,
and…\e"
MD0010021,"\h(«Aika»)You don't need to look very far to find a shop…
Everyone buys stuff… It's… it's normal.\e"
MD0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Well, Fina, you really don't get out much,
do you?\e"
MD0010023,"\h(«Aika»)According to the map, there's a city nearby
called Maramba. Let's go there first.\e"
MD0010024,\h(«Drachma»)I'm too old for this…\e
MD0100000,"\h(«Valuan Soldier»)Admiral Belleza, that ship is rescuing them.  \e"
MD0100001,"\h(«Belleza»)Ready the Lynx, I want to make sure they don't
escape.\e"
MD0100002,"\h(«Valuan Soldier»)Yes, Admiral.\e"
MD0100003,"\h(«Belleza»)Heh heh…
Well handsome, now we can see what you're made
of… \e"
MD0100004,"\h(«Aika»)Cap'n!
You came back just in time! \e"
MD0100005,"\h(«Drachma»)I didn't come back for you…
My search for Rhaknam brought me back to
this desert.\e"
MD0100006,"\h(«Drachma»)And I wasn't about to watch the three of you get
roasted by that… that thing…\e"
MD0100007,"\h(«Aika»)Hey Fina, get a load of the Cap'n…
I wonder how long he can act like 
he doesn't care about us.\e"
MD0100008,"\h(«Fina»)Hahaha… Aika, you really shouldn't tease him
like that.\e"
MD0100009,"\h(«Drachma»)Who's actin'!? I just want to find Rhaknam! 
Rotten little brats always gettin' me into
trouble.\e"
MD0100010,"\h(«Vyse»)Calm down, calm down, Captain.
But what should we do about that thing?\e"
MD0100011,"\h(«Drachma»)Hm… well, let's treat it like a practice run
for when I finally do fight Rhaknam.\e"
MD0100012,"\h(«Drachma»)That thing packs quite a punch. Do not get hit
by that beam, no matter what. I don't know if
the Little Jack can take a direct hit.\e"
MD0100013,"\h(«Vyse»)Aye aye!
Let's go!\e"
MD0100014,\h( )Drachma has joined your party.\e
MD0110000,\h(«Vyse»)Nothing is working!\e
MD0110001,"\h(«Drachma»)If we keep fightin' it head on, we're going to
lose.\e"
MD0110002,"\h(«Aika»)Hey Fina, can you think of a way to stop it?\e"
MD0110003,"\h(«Fina»)Gigas don't make their own decisions,
they only obey commands given to them by
the ones who awaken them.\e"
MD0110004,"\h(«Fina»)Until Belleza commands it to stop, 
there's nothing we can do…\e"
MD0110005,"\h(«Aika»)Hmmm…
So if something were to happen to Belleza…\e"
MD0110006,\h(«Aika»)I got it! I know how to stop that thing!\e
MD0110007,"\h(«What do you say?»)“You mean, attack Belleza's ship?”
“You mean, ram into the Gigas?”\e"
MD0110008,"\h(«Vyse»)You mean, attack Belleza's ship, right?\e"
MD0110009,"\h(«Vyse»)If we can stop her, we can force her into
calling off the Gigas!\e"
MD0110010,\h(«Aika»)You got it!\e
MD0110011,"\h(«Vyse»)You mean ram the Gigas, right?
We might be able to stop it if we send
the Little Jack full speed into the beast…\e"
MD0110012,"\h(«Aika»)No! That's not what I meant!
I don't want to die yet, you idiot!\e"
MD0110013,"\h(«Aika»)We should attack Belleza's ship. 
She's the only one that can stop that thing…\e"
MD0110014,"\h(«Aika»)So, if we can defeat her, we might be able to
force her to call the monster off!\e"
MD0110015,"\h(«Drachma»)That's a good idea.
Either way, we'll last longer against her than
we will against that thing!\e"
MD0110016,"\h(«Drachma»)Alright, full rudder!
Target, Belleza's ship! 
All hands to battle stations!\e"
MD0110017,"\h(«Vyse»)Aye aye, Captain!\e"
ME0010000,"\h(«Aika»)Hey, look!
There are leaves blowing in the wind.\e"
ME0010001,"\h(«Vyse»)Which means…  
We're close to land!\e"
ME0010002,\h(«Vyse»)We've finally made it across South Ocean!\e
ME0010003,\h(«Fina»)I'm sure these leaves came from Ixa'taka.\e
ME0010004,"\h(«Fina»)Under the light of the Green Moon, ever since
ancient times, the lands of Ixa'taka have been 
covered in lush forests.\e"
ME0010005,"\h(«Fina»)The life-giving Green Moon has blessed the lands
with fertility…\e"
ME0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Blessed lands, huh?\e"
ME0010007,"\h(«Aika»)If that's true, I'm sure there are all kinds of
delicious things to eat there.\e"
ME0010008,"\h(«Aika»)I can see it now… piles and piles of fruits 
and vegetables… of all different shapes, sizes,
colors, and tastes…\e"
ME0010009,"\h(«Vyse»)I bet there are just as many carnivorous 
monsters roaming around the woods, too…\e"
ME0010010,"\h(«Vyse»)Preying upon unsuspecting fools who sit there, 
stuffing their faces with fruit…\e"
ME0010011,"\h(«Aika»)Hey!
You don't have to crush my hopes like that!\e"
ME0010012,"\h(«Fina»)Haha… 
If Aika was hungry enough, she'd probably eat 
the monsters, too!\e"
ME0010013,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! 
Look what you did!
Now you've got Fina doing it!\e"
ME0010014,"\h(«Fina»)Oh… I… I'm sorry…
I didn't mean any harm…\e"
ME0010015,"\h(«Drachma»)Get to your posts…
Get ready to drop anchor.\e"
ME0010016,"\h(«Vyse»)Aye aye, Captain!
As soon as we see Ixa'taka, we'll look for a 
spot to land.\e"
MF0020000,"\h(«Gordo»)Heh heh… 
We give up…
You and your crew fought well…\e"
MF0020001,"\h(«Gordo»)Your name was Vyse, right?
I don't think I've ever seen you in North Ocean 
before.\e"
MF0020002,"\h(«Vyse»)This is the first time we've ever been to North 
Ocean…\e"
MF0020003,"\h(«Vyse»)For now, we're riding aboard Captain Drachma's 
ship, the Little Jack…\e"
MF0020004,"\h(«Gordo»)Drachma?
Wait…\e"
MF0020005,"\h(«Gordo»)Drachma, were you ever in North Ocean before?\e"
MF0020006,\h(«Drachma»)…What if I was?\e
MF0020007,"\h(«Gordo»)Then it is you!
I've heard all about you!\e"
MF0020008,"\h(«Gordo»)You're the sailor that is chasing the arcwhale, 
Rhaknam. If I remember correctly, it was to 
avenge your son, right?\e"
MF0020009,\h(«Drachma»)Enough!\e
MF0020010,"\h(«Drachma»)I don't know what stories you've been hearin', 
but I suggest you keep them to yourself.\e"
MF0020011,"\h(«Drachma»)And unless you want me to throw you overboard, 
you should get off my ship.\e"
MF0020012,"\h(«Gordo»)Aah… that's quite alright…
we'll be going now…\e"
MF0020013,"\h(«Drachma»)And what are you staring at?! Are you going to 
stand there all day? Get back up to the bridge 
before I throw YOU overboard!\e"
MF0020014,\h(«Everyone»)Yessir!\e
MF0020015,\h(«Drachma»)Hrmph…\e
MF0020016,\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam…\e
M00100000,"\h(«Aika»)That old man… 
He's working us really hard. 
He needs to lighten up.\e"
M00100001,"\h(«Aika»)But, he did save us… so I guess we can't
complain too much.
Oh, well, back to work… \c"
M00100002,"\h(«Aika»)Heh… Besides, I'm used to scrubbing decks 
anyway. Let's just get our work done, 
okay Vyse? I don't want to make him mad.\c"
M00100003,"\h(«Aika»)The Little Jack, huh?
It's kinda cute, but it's a strange name 
for a ship.\c"
M00100004,"\h(«Aika»)If we can take this guy to the border of Nasr
safely, we'll get a Valuan Passport!\e"
M00100005,"\h(«Aika»)We can't mess this up. 
This may be our only chance to get one, 
and everyone is counting on us.\c"
M00100006,"\h(«Aika»)Alright, Vyse!
We did it!!!\c"
M00100007,"\h(«Aika»)Now, we've got to sneak into Valua. 
I hate to admit it, but I am a little nervous… 
\c"
M00100008,"\h(«Aika»)With the Harpoon Cannon, the Little Jack should 
be able to get through stone reefs 
without any problems.\e"
M00100009,"\h(«Aika»)This is exciting. I always thought that 
stone reefs were impenetrable.\c"
M00100010,"\h(«Aika»)I can't wait to see what Nasr is like!
This is going to be fun!\c"
M00100011,"\h(«Aika»)I heard that South Ocean has 
a really strong crosswind!\e"
M00100012,"\h(«Aika»)We have to fly straight into the wind to get 
to Ixa'taka… This is going to be tough…\c"
M00100112,"\h(«Aika»)I can't believe these winds!
We're barely moving!\c"
M00100013,"\h(«Aika»)Ixa'taka, huh?
I hope they really do have a lot of 
fruits and stuff… I'm getting really hungry…\c"
M00100014,"\h(«Aika»)We have to find out where the king is hiding. 
Didn't they say it was to the
north of Horteka?\c"
M00100015,"\h(«Aika»)If the forest keeps burning like this, 
all of the trees and the animals
are gonna die!\e"
M00100016,\h(«Aika»)That guy who did this is gonna pay!\c
M00100017,"\h(«Aika»)They said that the Moon Stone Mines were
to the south of Horteka, right?\c"
M00100018,"\h(«Aika»)This Isapa guy…
Do you really think he's a High Priest?\e"
M00100019,"\h(«Aika»)I mean… he doesn't act very religious… 
If you ask me, I think he's just 
a dirty old man.\e"
M00100020,"\h(«Isapa»)Hey there, cutie!
Why don't you come back here and spend a little 
quality time with Isapa!\e"
M00100021,"\h(«Aika»)…See what I'm talking about?
I think we have the wrong person… I swear…\e"
M00100022,"\h(«Aika»)Hehe… This feels like a treasure hunt!
I'm so excited!\e"
M00100023,"\h(«Aika»)The Golden Man and the Great Bird, huh?
Hmm… I wonder who names this stuff… \c"
M00100024,"\h(«Aika»)Do you really think that the streets 
of this Lost City are paved with gold?
Hee hee! I can't wait!\e"
M00100025,"\h(«Aika»)Hey Fina, you don't suppose they would mind if I
took the tiniest itty-bitty piece of gold 
from the Lost City, do you?\e"
M00100026,\h(«Fina»)I… I really don't think it's a good idea.\e
M00100027,"\h(«Aika»)Well, what do they expect? We're Air Pirates! 
I'm sure they'll understand. Now let's hurry up 
and find this place!\c"
M00100028,"\h(«Aika»)A Lost City where even the streets
are paved in gold?!
Heehee! I can't wait!\e"
M00100029,"\h(«Aika»)I liked Ixa'taka! 
And those slides were really fun, too!\e"
M00100030,"\h(«Aika»)Well, to be completely honest, I was really
disappointed with Rixis. There wasn't much 
gold, but at least there weren't any ghosts.\c"
M00100031,\h(«Aika»)I wonder what upset the Cap'n so much?\e
M00100032,"\h(«Aika»)Hey, something's wrong with the Cap'n. He's 
usually pretty cranky, but now he just keeps to
himself. I wonder what's bothering him…\e"
M00100033,"\h(«Aika»)This fog… it's just like the first time 
we ran into Rhaknam.\e"
M00100034,"\h(«Aika»)That huge arcwhale is out there, somewhere. 
I know we have the Harpoon Cannon, but
I've got a really bad feeling about this.\c"
M00200000,"\h(«Fina»)I guess this means I shall be sailing with you
guys from now on.\e"
M00200001,"\h(«Fina»)I can do my fair share of the work. 
Just tell me what to do… 
and I'll do my best.\c"
M00200002,"\h(«Fina»)Nasr became a desert because of the heat 
from the Red Moon. It's too hot and dry 
for most plants to survive.\e"
M00200003,"\h(«Fina»)I'm sure that it's not hot enough to light 
your hair on fire, but it's hot there.\c"
M00200004,"\h(«Fina»)Thanks to all of you, we were able to secure the
Red Moon Crystal.\e"
M00200005,"\h(«Fina»)I hope that we will be able to gather the rest
of the Crystals as well.\e"
M00200105,"\h(«Fina»)Ixa'taka…
I hope we can secure the Green Crystal without
any trouble…\c"
M00200006,"\h(«Fina»)Ixa'taka… 
I hope that we can safely acquire 
the Green Moon Crystal…\c"
M00200007,"\h(«Fina»)Wow…
I've never seen so many trees 
before in my life…\e"
M00200008,"\h(«Fina»)Actually…
In the place where I am from, 
we don't even have plants.\e"
M00200009,"\h(«Fina»)The air is so clean here… 
It smells good. 
It's so… refreshing.\c"
M00200010,"\h(«Fina»)Thank the Moons! At least Valua hasn't gotten 
hold of the Moon Crystal yet.\e"
M00200011,\h(«Fina»)We must acquire the Crystal before Valua does…\e
M00200012,"\h(«Fina»)The man named Isapa is supposedly being held in
Moon Stone Mountain, right?\e"
M00200013,"\h(«Fina»)I'm glad we were able to rescue Isapa.
He's not what I expected, though.\c"
M00200014,"\h(«Fina»)“The Kneeling Golden Man and the Great Bird 
with spread wings will show the way to Rixis.”\e"
M00200015,"\h(«Fina»)I wonder if the man and the bird are statues, 
or if they are something that 
we'll have to fight.\e"
M00200016,"\h(«Fina»)I'm sure if we search all of Ixa'taka, 
we'll find them, but how long will that take?\c"
M00200017,"\h(«Fina»)“The Kneeling Golden Man and the Great Bird 
with spread wings will show the way to Rixis.”\e"
M00200018,"\h(«Fina»)If we go to where the Golden Man and 
the Great Bird are pointing, we 
will find Rixis.\c"
M00200019,"\h(«Fina»)Valua is under the divine protection of the
Yellow Moon. The Yellow Moon Crystal is
probably somewhere in Valuan lands…\c"
M00200020,"\h(«Fina»)That pirate, Gordo… he seemed to know a lot
about the Captain…\e"
M00200021,"\h(«Fina»)It's not often that the Captain gets so worked
up over something… I wonder what's bothering
him…\e"
M00200022,"\h(«Fina»)That arcwhale, Rhaknam… I wonder if…
It's probably nothing… \c"
M00300000,"\h(«Man with an Artificial Arm»)Hurry up and bring the boxes from
the storage room up here!\c"
M00300001,"\h(«Drachma»)What are you doin'?! Stop wastin' time.
Get us to Sailor's Island, boy.\e"
M00300002,"\h(«Drachma»)The merchant told us to follow the stone reef 
from Sailor's Island and head east 
to reach Nasr.\c"
M00300003,"\h(«Drachma»)We should reach the Nasr border if we just 
follow this stone reef to the east.\e"
M00300004,"\h(«Drachma»)We may have defeated Baltor, but we're 
not done yet. Stay sharp!\c"
M00300005,"\h(«Drachma»)Valua is a country surrounded by dark mountains
to the north.\e"
M00300006,"\h(«Drachma»)Valua is completely surrounded by a ring of 
mountains. The Yellow Moon causes 
electrical storms. That's why it's always dark.\c"
M00300007,\h(«Drachma»)……\e
M00300008,\h(«Drachma»)……\e
M00300009,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, Captain… you've been awfully 
quiet lately. Is something bothering you?\e"
M00300010,"\h(«Drachma»)… Don't worry about it.
Hurry and get us to Maramba.\e"
M00300011,"\h(«Drachma»)I'll tell ya now, if we see any signs of 
Rhaknam, we're goin' after him. Got it?\c"
M00300111,"\h(«Drachma»)It's a good thing that we took that engine from
that Valuan Flagship.\c"
M00300012,"\h(«Drachma»)Heh… This new engine's got power. 
I wouldn't expect anything less from 
a Valuan Admiral's Flagship.\e"
M00300013,"\h(«Drachma»)I hope we run into Rhaknam while we're 
in Ixa'taka…\c"
M00300014,"\h(«Drachma»)It seems that there are a lot of fish in
these lands… and a lot of rare ones, at that.\e"
M00300015,"\h(«Drachma»)If we only had some more time… 
I wouldn't mind doin' some fishin'…\c"
M00300016,"\h(«Drachma»)De Loco…
The fifth Admiral of the Imperial Armada. 
He's known for makin' weapons… \e"
M00300017,"\h(«Drachma»)He's a little obsessive… Once he's after 
something, he'll stop at nothing until it's
destroyed.\c"
M00300018,"\h(«Drachma»)Valua has probably set up some sort 
of base in the Moon Stone Mountains. 
Be careful.\c"
M00300019,\h(«Drachma»)Damn Valuans!\c
M00300020,"\h(«Drachma»)We'll have to keep searchin' until we 
find Rixis. Maybe we'll find Rhaknam 
as well.\c"
M00300021,"\h(«Drachma»)So, the Green Moon Crystal is 
in this Lost City called Rixis…
Hmmm… \e"
M00300022,"\h(«Drachma»)Well, let's hurry up and find it… 
I'm tired of wanderin' around 
all over the place.\c"
M00300023,"\h(«Drachma»)The area between Valua and 
Ixa'taka is called North Ocean.\e"
M00300024,"\h(«Drachma»)The Valuan trade lines are in North Ocean.
You can expect to see lots of Valuan Battleships
and various merchant ships around here.\e"
M00300025,"\h(«Drachma»)… This is the perfect spot for Air Pirates 
to ambush the ships. Keep an eye out for 'em.\c"
M00300026,\h(«Drachma»)……\e
M00300027,\h(«Drachma»)……\e
M00300028,"\h(«Drachma»)Stop wastin' time!!
We should be lookin' for Rhaknam!!\c"
M05290000,"\h(«Isapa»)It's a privilege traveling with such beautiful
women, the Silvite girl with her green eyes, and
the goofy one with her… spirit.\e"
M05290001,"\h(«Isapa»)Perhaps I'll just stay with you guys!
Wahahahaha!!!\e"
Ms033a000,"\h(«Vyse»)Oops… I almost tripped over that bucket of
water. I don't think the Captain would've been
very happy if I did…\c"
Ms033a001,"\h(«Vyse»)Ack! There's a bunch of long and slimy insects
in here. Is this what the Captain uses as bait
to catch fish?\c"
Ms033a002,"\h(«Vyse»)There are containers of gunpowder scattered
across the floor. That's probably more than just
a little dangerous…\e"
Ms033a003,"\h(«Vyse»)But, I guess even a small fishing boat like this
one needs to keep itself well-armed.\c"
Ms033a004,"\h(«Vyse»)There are containers of gunpowder scattered
across the floor. That's probably more than just
a little dangerous…\c"
Ms033a005,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow… Now THAT'S a big harpoon. I could sort of
tell by the way he dresses, but it looks like
the Captain is a fisherman by trade.\e"
Ms033a006,"\h(«Vyse»)The harpoon is full of nicks and
scratches. I wonder how many years
he's been using this thing…\c"
Ms033a007,"\h(«Vyse»)It's the Captain's harpoon. It's full of nicks
and scratches. I wonder how many years
he's been using this thing…\c"
Ms033a008,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… Supply boxes… supply boxes… Where are
the supply boxes. Somehow, I don't think this
is what the Captain was talking about.\c"
Ms033a009,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a large box full of fishing equipment.
It smells faintly of rotting fish… He probably
doesn't clean his equipment very well.\c"
Ms033a010,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a barrel full of loqua. I guess it's
convenient to keep some in the bridge just in
case you get thirsty…\c"
Ms033a011,"\h(«Vyse»)This is a really old map. It looks like it's
been sitting in the sun for a really long time…
It's starting to fall apart at the edges.\c"
Ms033a012,"\h(«Vyse»)This box sure was heavy…
And the Captain still hasn't told me what
was inside of this thing…\c"
Ms033a013,"\h(«Vyse»)This barrel's empty.
Yuck… It smells like there used to be fish in
here. I regret sticking my nose in here…\c"
Ms033a014,\h(«Vyse»)Well… Should we set sail?\e
Ms033a015,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ms033a016,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright, Little Jack… Full speed ahead!\c"
Ms033a017,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… Maybe I'll look around the ship a bit
more before we set sail again.\c"
Ms033a018,"\h(«Vyse»)The Captain did say that we're spending the
night here… I probably shouldn't move the ship
without the Captain's permission at least.\c"
Ms033a019,"\h(«Vyse»)This ship won't hold up much longer! We've got
to get out of here! We need to hurry up and get
to the lifeboats!\c"
Ms033a020,"\h(«Vyse»)It's too dangerous to go out onto the deck right
now! We need to hurry up and get to the
lifeboats!\c"
M80200000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M80200001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M80200002,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M81200000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)We are the Nasr Air Guard. Our primary
responsibility is to defend Nasrad from
invaders.\e"
M81200001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)In order for the Valuan Armada to invade us,
they will have to go through the strait.\c"
M80210000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M80210001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M80210002,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M81210000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)Hah! The Valuans are overconfident. They think
their Armada is unstoppable. Let them try to get
past us.\e"
M81210001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)It doesn't matter how many ships they have. If
they try to rush through the strait, we'll just
pick them off.\c"
M90010000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)This region of the sky is like a giant maze.
There are sky rifts and islands all over the
place.\e"
M90010001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)We need to be careful around here. There are
lots of spots where Air Pirates can hide and
ambush us.\c"
M90010002,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Shrine Island? Forget it. No one in their right
mind would go near the place.\e"
M90010003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I've heard that there are monsters on that
island, and if you fly close enough, you can
hear them at night when the winds are still.\c"
M90010004,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)It was incredible! I heard this really loud
rumble, and my ship started shaking. I looked
over the side…\e"
M90010005,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)… I saw a whole fleet of Valuan warships. I
wonder where they were going. With a fleet that
large, they must have been attacking someone.\c"
M90010006,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)If you're looking for Sailors' Island, it's
northeast of here. Just look for the
lighthouse… it'll guide you to the port.\e"
M90010007,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You'll see it right after you go through the
rock tunnel.\c"
M90010008,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)From what I hear, Valua has added another
admiral to it's ranks. That makes six main
fleets in the Armada now.\e"
M90010009,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)With that many ships, they must be up to
something. I wouldn't want to get on their bad
side.\c"
M90010010,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Where'd you get that ship?! I've never seen a
ship like that before!\e"
M90010011,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Wait a second… That's a Valuan Ship! You stole
it!!! You're either very brave… or very
stupid!\c"
M90010012,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Is that right? There's really a land called
Yafutoma in the far east?\e"
M90010013,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)What?! You say you can reach Yafutoma by going
west, too? Wait… I don't get it…\c"
M90010014,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I can't believe it… Valua has been completely
destroyed. You can still smell the smoke at 100
leagues, if you're downwind.\c"
M90020000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Say, you must be members of the infamous Dyne
Clan. We've been hearing a lot about you guys
lately!\e"
M90020001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)We hear you've been really stirring things up
over in Valua. Keep up the good work.
We're behind you all the way.\c"
M90020002,\h(«Merchant Ship»)I saw a Moon Stone hit Shrine Island yesterday.\e
M90020003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)That stone is as good as gone. You'd have to be
crazy to go after it. Shrine Island is haunted,
you know.\c"
M90020004,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You're going to Valua? Just head north from
here. It should be easy to find. But, you'll
need a passport to get in.\e"
M90020005,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Passports are usually only issued to a very
small number of merchants who are permitted to
trade with Valua.\c"
M90020006,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I just heard that the Ship Parts Merchant in
Sailors' Island just got in a shipment of
Secondary Cannons.\e"
M90020007,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)All of the stores in Sailors' Island get regular
shipments of new goods every now and then. You
should check back there often.\c"
M90020008,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)A Valuan ship! Please spare me! I have done
nothing wrong! I have a family to feed!!\e"
M90020009,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)What? You're Air Pirates? Heh… You scared me
there for a second. But wait… I suppose I
should still be scared, huh?\c"
M90020010,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You said you sailed around the world? Ha! Yeah,
right! What kind of fool do you take me for?
Everyone knows the world is flat!\c"
M90020011,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)That massive island came up from Deep Sky and
now the sky rifts are gone!\e"
M90020012,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I wonder if the sky rifts were formed when the
island sank into Deep Sky in the first place.\c"
M90020013,\h(«Merchant Ship»)I can't believe that island rose from Deep Sky!\e
M90020014,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Think of the impact that it's going to have on
all of the trade routes.\c"
M90200000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)This region is called Mid Ocean. All of the
trade routes pass through here.\e"
M90200001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)That's Sailors' Island, over there. It's in the
middle of all of the trade routes, so it's a
great place to gather information.\c"
M90200002,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Wow! That's an impressive weapon you have there.
Hey, is that a Harpoon Cannon? I've heard those
things can blast through stone reefs!\e"
M90200003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)If you pass through that stone reef, and
continue west, you'll see Nasr. You'll know
you're there when you see a huge desert.\c"
M90200004,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Have you heard? They say that Nasrad, the
capital of Nasr, has been destroyed.\e"
M90200005,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)An Admiral named Ramirez leveled the place. Some
of the merchants are helping the refugees.\c"
M90200006,\h(«Merchant Ship»)They've reopened the route to Cape Victory!\e
M90200007,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Now that engineers are developing engines that
can power through sky rifts, it's even safe to
go to Esparanza now!\e"
M90200008,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)A few advances in technology can really change
the world.\c"
M90200009,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I heard a rumble, then there were some strong
gusts of wind. I was trying to keep control of
my ship, and that island came out of nowhere!\e"
M90200010,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Some merchants see this as an opportunity to
make a profit, but not me! I'm more concerned
with staying alive!\c"
M90200011,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You guys are amazing! You actually defeated the
Valuan Armada! I can't believe it!\e"
M90200012,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)But the Valuans still have a base on that huge
island! I hope you can send that thing back into
Deep Sky where it belongs!\c"
M91200000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Just recently, trade routes have been
established in North Ocean!\e"
M91200001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I heard that Gordo, the Air Pirate, actually
opened a restaurant out there, and I heard
that the food is really good, too!\c"
M91200002,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I'm not about to let that new continent scare me
away! Trade has been better than ever, lately.\e"
M91200003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I know Air Pirates spend all their time going
after treasure, but we have to make an honest
living.\c"
M90210000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)If you head due north from here, you'll run into
Valua.\e"
M90210001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Be careful, they won't let you in without a
Valuan Passport. And forget about sneaking
in, there are patrols all over the place.\c"
M90210002,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You guys are pirates, aren't you? If you are,
I'd stay clear of Valua. If they catch you,
you're as good as dead.\e"
M90210003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Valua has strict laws against piracy. If they
even think you're a pirate, they bring you to
the Coliseum and execute you.\c"
M90210004,\h(«Merchant Ship»)Did you hear what happened in Valua?\e
M90210005,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)There's rumors that someone actually broke out
of the Grand Fortress. I'd like to meet that
guy, and shake his hand.\c"
M90210006,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I've seen a lot of Valuan construction ships in
the area. They must be working on something
pretty big.\c"
M90210007,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Hey, did you hear? Valua is constructing a new
base. They are building it on Dangral Island.\e"
M90210008,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)None of our ships can fly low enough to get a
good look at it, but there's been lots of
construction ships in the area.\e"
M90210009,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)With that ship of yours, you might be able to
see what's going on. Go south and and start
searching under the clouds. You can't miss it.\c"
M90210010,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You should be able to see the base, if you fly
south from here and search under the clouds.\c"
M90210011,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)There's been a lot of Valuan ships around here
lately, so we figured that they were up to
something…\e"
M90210012,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)But I never would have guessed that they were
capable of raising an entire continent out of
Deep Sky.\c"
M90210013,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I can't believe it! You guys were amazing! I
never thought I'd see all of the Air Pirates
join forces and attack the Armada head on.\e"
M90210014,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)By winning that battle, you guys changed the 
course of the world! Who knows what would 
have happened if the Armada had won?\c"
M90050000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Welcome to Nasr, the desert kingdom!\e"
M90050001,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)There's a port called Maramba nearby. Your ship
looks like it's been through quite a bit. Maybe
you should restock your supplies there.\c"
M90050002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)It looks like your ship is from Nasr, but you
don't look Nasrean. I should warn you…\e"
M90050003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)With a ship that small, you would never make it
through the stone reefs that surround our
beautiful desert. You should turn back.\c"
M90050004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)If you go southwest from here, you'll reach
South Ocean, there are some really strong
headwinds there, so be careful.\e"
M90050005,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)It is uncharted territory… no one has ever made
it through South Ocean before, although many
have tried.\c"
M90050006,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Cape Victory? I've heard of it. It's on the
southern tip of Nasr.\e"
M90050007,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)If you want to go there, although I can't
imagine why anyone would go there, you'll have
to fly through a sky rift. Good luck trying…\c"
M90050008,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Items from the newly discovered continent have
already begun to make their way into the
marketplaces of the rest of the world.\e"
M90050009,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Nasrad may have been destroyed, but as long as
there are goods to trade, merchants like us
will survive.\c"
M90050010,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Soltis… Yes, I've heard that name before. It
was the name of an ancient civilization.
Some of our historians have records of it.\e"
M90050011,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)The legends state that the Moons themselves
pushed the entire continent into Deep Sky.\c"
M90060000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Hail, travelers! I am a merchant from the
Kingdom of Nasr.\e"
M90060001,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)My primary trade is in carpets and Red Moon
Stones.\c"
M90060002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)During ship battles, sometimes your gunners will
lose sight of their targets. Any gunner worth
his salt will shout “Lost” when this happens.\e"
M90060003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)This often happens when your opponent gets
behind you in the heat of battle.\c"
M90060004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I heard that the Valuan Armada attacked Nasrad,
and destroyed the city!\e"
M90060005,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I'll bet they burned my shop to the ground, too.
Damn Valuans!\c"
M90060006,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)My shop in Nasrad is gone… destroyed in the
attack. I have no idea what I'm going to do
now…\c"
M90060007,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)First, the Armada leveled Nasrad, now it looks
like they're going to destroy the rest of the
world too.\e"
M90060008,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Please… I know who you are… I've heard of
tales of your bravery… I beg you. Please… stop
them. You're the only one who can.\c"
M91060000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Welcome to Nasrad, the capital of our kingdom!\e"
M91060001,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)We have riches beyond your wildest dreams…
We are truly blessed by the Red Moon.
Enjoy your stay…\c"
M91060002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Your ship is able to fly beneath the clouds, I'm
sure you've seen some amazing things.\e"
M91060003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I bet there're strange creatures and sunken
ships down there, eh?\e"
M90220002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)The Nasr fleet protects our trade routes from
Black Pirates. That's why Nasr is so profitable.
Everyone trades with us, because it's safe.\c"
M90220003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)The capitol of Nasr, may have been
destroyed, but not the spirit of the Nasr
people. They've already started rebuilding.\e"
M90220004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I know that a new city will rise from the ashes
of the old.\c"
M90230000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)If you keep heading south, you'll run into South
Ocean. Traveling through there is almost
impossible.\e"
M90230001,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)There are some really strong headwinds there…
Most ships can't handle it. It's best to
avoid that area completely.\c"
M90230002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)What?!
You're really going to try to cross South Ocean?
But, no one has ever crossed it before!!\e"
M90230003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)What is it with young people these days?
You could get killed! Well, don't say I didn't
warn you.\c"
M90230004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)What?! You mean to tell me that you crossed
South Ocean and discovered a new continent?\e"
M90230005,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Hmm… If that's true, it might be possible to
start a new trade route through South Ocean.\c"
M90230006,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)We tried to set up a trade route with the new
continent through South Ocean, but the headwinds
were too strong.\e"
M90230007,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Trade routes have opened in North Ocean, but
that doesn't help us here in the South.\c"
M90230008,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I don't know if it has anything to do with the
appearance of that huge island, but the
skies of South Ocean are calm.\e"
M90230009,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Once the war is over, I may be able to open up
that trade route to the new continent like I've
been wanting to.\e"
M90230010,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I'm counting on you, Vyse! It's entirely on your
shoulders! Think of the possibilities! Think of
the money!\c"
M90150000,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I don't think I've ever seen a ship like that
around here before. I'll bet it's a Moon Stone
Trader coming to dig up Yellow Moon Stones.\e"
M90150001,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Just so you know, the Moon Stones in this area
have already been mined, so there's hardly any
left.\e"
M90150002,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Valua is trying to expand because we need to
find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"
M90150003,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Valua is trying to expand because we need to
find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"
M90150004,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Ah, protecting us from Air Pirates… Good. It's
always nice to see that the Valuan Armada is
looking out for us.\e"
M90150005,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I've heard that there's an Air Pirate named Vyse
who thinks he can outwit the Armada. I hope you
catch him!\c"
M90150006,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)It's shocking news! Lord Galcian has rebelled
against Empress Teodora!\e"
M90150007,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I, I never would have imagined that our glorious
empire would errupt into civil war! I wonder
what Lord Galcian is after…\c"
M90150008,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I couldn't believe my eyes. Moon Stones were
falling on Valua… like rain!\e"
M90150009,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)When the rain stopped, there was nothing left…
Valua has been destroyed.\c"
M90160000,\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)Shhh! Hey kid… I got some Valuan arms here…\e
M90160001,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)I also buy and sell Discovery information.
I've got everything you need…\c"
M90160002,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Buy and sell Discovery information.”
“Leave.”\e"
M90160003,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)Valua discovered Ixa'taka several years ago and
immediately conquered it.\e"
M90160004,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)Today it is a colony of Valua. The people of
Ixa'taka have been put to work as slaves in
order to get Moon Stones.\c"
M90160005,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this
region, and the Ixa'takans don't have a need for
ship parts…\e"
M90160006,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)I really don't know how much longer I'll be able
to stay in business. Maybe it's time to look for
a new line of work…\c"
M90160008,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)You've heard of Domingo, right… He's one of
the greatest explorers of our time.\e"
M90160009,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)If you're hunting for treasure in this area,
good luck. It's not easy finding anything that
Domingo hasn't already discovered.\e"
M90160010,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)Last time I saw him, he said he was searching
for the “Ixa'taka Palace.”\e"
M90160011,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this
region, and the Ixa'takans don't have a need for
ship parts…\e"

to stay in business. Maybe it's time to look for
a new line of work…\c"
M90160007,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)I'm always flying around this area, so if you're
ever around, feel free to stop by.\c"
M90280000,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)North Ocean is a vital trade route that brings a
wealth of new goods from the new continent back
to Valua.\e"
M90280001,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Unfortunately, where there's gold to be made,
there's always pirates that want to steal it.
Be careful!\c"
M90280002,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Admirals Belleza and Vigoro took their fleets to
do battle in the west just a little while ago…\e"
M90280003,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Both fleets suffered heavy losses. I wonder what
happened to them?\c"
M90280004,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Just recently, other merchants have begun
trading with the new continent, and Valua's
losing control over the trade routes.\e"
M90280005,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I've also heard that there's dissention in
the Royal Palace, too.\c"
M90280006,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Our capital has been destroyed. Our glorious
reign of Valuan supremacy appears to be at an
end.\c"
M90290000,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)What do you think of my new ship? Just look at
the shine on this baby! Its new engine is even
capable of punching through sky rifts.\e"
M90290001,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)With ships like this, we'll be able to establish
a trade route running from Maramba to Esparanza!\c"
M90290002,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)The other day when I was flying near the Dark
Rift, I was attacked by a creature the size of
an island.\e"
M90290003,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I barely managed to escape with my life… I
couldn't believe how big it was… It was the
scariest thing I've ever seen!\c"
M90070000,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Your ship is very different.
Are you from the West?\e"
M90070001,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)These lands are blessed by the Green Moon.
It is called Ixa'taka.
The forest is our home.\c"
M90070002,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Our people eat berries and seeds. We really like
to eat “Sky Sardis” but they are harder to
catch than berries and seeds.\e"
M90070003,\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Can you please bring me 10 “Sky Sardis?”\c
M90070004,"\h(«Vyse»)If you want “Sky Sardis,” I have 10 right
here! You can have them, if you want.\e"
M90070005,"\h( )You give 10 “Sky Sardis” to the captain of the
ship.\e"
M90070006,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Chomp chomp chomp…
Yum! I love fish!\e"
M90070007,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)I'd eat them every day, but they're too hard to
catch.\e"
M90070008,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Thank you. I am very grateful.
Take this as a symbol of my appreciation.\e"
M90070009,\h( )You received 1 “Abirik Cham.”\c
M90070010,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The “Sky Sardis” were very good.
But, I got a bone stuck in my throat! I guess I
ate them too fast.\c"
M90080000,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Our ships have wings, but they also need
Moon Stones for fuel.\e"
M90080001,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The Valuan ships breathe fire.
We are no match for them.\c"
M90080002,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)A Great Bird spreads its wings… I once heard
this story, a long time ago.\e"
M90080003,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Somewhere near the northern lake, they say
there's a Great Bird that's visible only from
the sky.\c"
M90080004,\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The Valuans left Moon Stone Mountain.\e
M90080005,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The people that were taken hostage returned to
Horteka. I'm so glad that they're all safe.\c"
M90080006,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Many, many Valuan ships came. The ship with the
big firestick blew a hole in the western stone
reef.\e"
M90080007,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)But then, your ship appeared through that hole.
Where did you come from?\c"
M90080008,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)There's a hole at the end of the world. It's big
and scary. I'm going to stay away from it.\e"
M90080009,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The other day, I went near the hole. Another
ship came out. All of the people on it had black
hair. I was scared.\c"
M90240000,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)We've been hiding, but with the Valuans gone,
we can fly our ships again.\e"
M90240001,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The Valuans left through the iron wall across
the northern valley and flew away. I think you
can get to Valua from there.\c"
M90240002,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Many Valuan ships came. I was afraid and hid
from them. They flew past me, to the west
of here.\e"
M90240003,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)After a while, the ships came back. There was
lots of smoke on the ships. I wonder what
happened…\c"
M90240004,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)I heard a scary noise coming from the eastern
skies. I wonder what it was…\c"
M90250000,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)I live apart from the rest of the world in this
quiet place, making my home with the flowers
and the insects.\e"
M90250001,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)I'm grateful that you took the trouble to visit
me here, so let me tell you a little secret.\e"
M90250002,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a
wonderful flower called the “Balloon Flower.”
It's very beautiful.\e"
M90250003,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)You will also find a huge flock of insects that
flutter in the wind if you travel to the land
where Ixa'taka meets the Land of the Red Moon.\e"
M90250004,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)… Travel high in the sky to find
“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90250005,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a

“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90110000,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)I'm a fisherman. I've been chasing after a fish
called “Hamahai” for a long time.\e"
M90110001,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)This fish called “Hamahai” is a really rare
species that's found only in the skies high
above Yafutoma.\e"
M90110002,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)They fetch a great price, of course. If you have
the time, you might want to see if you can snag
some.\c"
M90120000,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Who are you guys anyway? And how do you manage
to stay in the air with those steel ships of
yours?\e"
M90120001,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)I know who you are! You're Westerners! I've read
about people from the West, but you're the first
Westerners that I've actually seen!\e"
M90120002,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Thanks to Prince Daigo, the Tenkou fleet has now
been recognized as an official part of the
Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120003,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)They don't have to stay in the ranks either.
Because they're Air Pirates, they're better at
guerilla tactics and boarding enemy ships!\c"
M90120004,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Prince Daigo already set sail towards the west
with the rest of the Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120005,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)I think Yafutoma is better off with Prince Daigo
as a Naval Commander. It was a mistake to exile
him in the first place.\c"
M90260000,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Mount Kazai is our most impressive landmark. I
doubt any ships from the west would be able to
sail over it.\c"
M90260001,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)What?! You're telling me that your ship can sail
over Mount Kazai?!\e"
M90260002,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Well, I'm really impressed. My compliments
to your engineers.\c"
M90270000,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Beyond the eastern sky, there is a stone reef. I
found a hole in it, but I've been too scared to
fly close to it.\e"
M90270001,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)The other day, I finally got the courage to go
near it, but I saw someone in a strange-looking
ship, wearing a mask, so I flew away.\c"
M90750000,"\h(«Gordo»)There haven't been any fish around here since
that new island came out of Deep Sky.\e"
M90750001,"\h(«Gordo»)Anyone who takes food away from me will pay
dearly. Vyse, I hope you destroy them…\c"
M90750002,"\h(«Gordo»)What was that? 
You're looking for Gentum, Khale, and Kabal?\e"
M90750003,"\h(«Gordo»)I see… well, it looks like you are searching
for some exotic ingredients.\e"
M90750004,"\h(«Gordo»)Fortunately, we serve Kabal here in my
restaurant. I'd be more than happy to give
you some.\e"
M90750005,"\h(«Gordo»)It's always best to marinade it for a day or two
before cooking it… that's when all the flavors
start to come out. Good Kabal is very rare…\e"
M90750006,\h( )You received “Kabal.”\e
M90750007,"\h(«Gordo»)Well then…
You're still looking for the other 2
ingredients, right?\e"
M90750008,"\h(«Gordo»)Hmm… It's a commonly used spice over in Nasr,
and it's easily recognizable by its scent.\e"
M90750009,"\h(«Gordo»)I'd be surprised if you couldn't find any in
Nasrad. After all, it is the largest trade city
in the world.\e"
M90750010,"\h(«Gordo»)And what else were you looking for? Ah yes…
Khale. The “Spice of Dreams” as it is sometimes
called.\e"
M90750011,"\h(«Gordo»)Not only does it spice up food, it actually
enhances the flavor of it as well.\e"
M90750012,"\h(«Gordo»)But, I have heard rumors that the last of the
Khale Trees burned down in the Valua - Nasr
War.\e"
M90750013,"\h(«Gordo»)In the Far East, there is an island that is made
up entirely of spices. If you can find that
island, you may be in luck.\c"
M90750014,"\h(«Gordo»)I think you'll be able to find “Gentum” in
Nasrad.\e"
M90750015,"\h(«Gordo»)If you're looking for “Khale”, there may be some
on Spice Island in the Far East.\c"
M90750016,"\h(«Gordo»)Well, well… I see that the information that I
gave you on Gentum and Khale was helpful.\e"
M90750017,"\h(«Gordo»)If you ever have any more questions concerning
exotic ingredients, I'll be able to help. I'm
not called the Gourmet Pirate for nothing.\c"
M90760000,"\h(«Daigo»)Well, Vyse, this is it. The rest of us will be
watching your back from up here. Go Vyse, you're
the only one that can do this.\c"
M90760001,\h(«Jao»)We pray…\e
M90760002,\h(«Mao»)… for your victory.\c
M90780002,"\h(«Centime»)Vyse, if it is okay, could you take my son,
Hans, with you?\e"
M90780003,"\h(«Centime»)He looks up to you quite a bit. And even though
he's already very skilled at engineering, I
think it would be great training for him.\e"
M90780004,"\h(«Centime»)I think it is time for him to go off on his own
and make his mark in the world.\e"
M90780005,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse, take me with you! I'll do my best to be
of service!\e"
M90780006,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Of course!”
“Sorry, but I can't take you with me.”\e"
M90780007,"\h(«Vyse»)Of course!
I could use another good engineer on my ship!\e"
M90780008,\h(«Hans»)Really? Thank you so much!\e
M90780009,\h( )Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M90780010,"\h(«Vyse»)Sorry, but I can't take you with me.
Doesn't Centime need you to work on his ship?\e"
M90780011,"\h(«Centime»)Don't worry about me, Vyse. I'm quite an
accomplished engineer myself. I've taught him
all that I can.\e"
M90780012,"\h(«Hans»)My father has trained me well! But I know there
is probably much more that I can learn by
working on your ship! Please!\e"
M90780013,"\h(«Vyse»)I see…
Alright, then. I'll take you with me.\e"
M90780014,\h(«Hans»)Thank you so much!\e
M90780015,\h( )Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M90780000,"\h(«Centime»)Hans… You'll have to pull your own weight on
the Delphinus… And do what Captain Vyse tells
you to do.\e"
M90780001,"\h(«Hans»)Sure, Dad. You've taught me well, and I always
follow orders. I'll do everything I can to help
Captain Vyse.\c"
M90770000,"\h(«Gilder's Vice Captain»)Captain Gilder! You can leave the Claudia with
us! We'll take care of her!\e"
M90770001,"\h(«Willy»)Leave it to us! Wrrack!
Leave it to us!\c"
M90790000,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, Gilder… promise me… promise me that you'll
come back. I'll be waiting right here.\e"
M90790001,"\h(«Clara»)We will always be together. We'll watch the
sunset when you get back. It'll be so romantic.
You're such a dreamboat. My ring size is…\e"
M90790002,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! What am I
saying!? Gilder, we can discuss this later…
Hurry back!\c"

come back to me!\e"
M91160000,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, on the Albatross, you always did your
best. You were always the first to board an
enemy ship, and nobody could stop you.\e"
M91160001,"\h(«Dyne»)I've always been proud of you. Maybe there were
times when I didn't show it, but I've never been
disappointed in you.\e"
M91160002,"\h(«Dyne»)Now, this is it. We've got the enemy cornered.
Don't give up, Vyse! I know you can do it!\c"
M92000000,"\h(«Baltor»)Don't you dare get yourself killed, now, Vyse!
Understand?! I want you to know I won't stand
for it!\e"
M92000001,"\h(«Baltor»)I'll kill you if you die fighting with those
clowns. Got that?! I'm the one who gets to kill
you! Me!\c"
M09902000,"\h(«Aika»)Visibility is horrible!
Vyse, the fog's too thick!
I can barely see!\e"
M09902001,"\h(«Vyse»)That's strange… there's never any fog in this
region… I wonder what's causing it.\e"
M09902002,"\h(«Vyse»)The only way to get to Valua is through here…
Slow to half speed…\e"
M09902003,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, wait… we're too close to that island
over there!\e"
M09903000,"\h(«Dyne»)Hey, you're going the wrong way.
There's nothing but open sky over there.\e"
M09903001,"\h(«Dyne»)Turn around and head back to Pirate Isle. This
is no time for you to be fooling around.\c"
M09903002,"\h(«Aika»)Hey, Vyse! You're heading the wrong way! Did you
forget how to read a compass or something?\e"
M09903003,"\h(«Aika»)Shrine Island is to the southwest of here!
That's when the little needle thingy is between
the “S” and the “W.”\c"
M09903004,"\h(«Aika»)Where are you going? We need to get back home to
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909900,"\h(«Dyne»)This is Shrine Island. Some people say that it's
some kind of ancient temple, others think it's
haunted.\e"
M09909901,"\h(«Dyne»)We don't have time to go sight-seeing. Turn the
ship around and head back to Pirate Isle.\c"
M09904000,"\h(«Valuan Patrol Ship»)Beyond this point is the Valuan Empire. Show me
your entry passport.\e"

allow you to go beyond this point! Go back to
the pit you crawled out of!\c"

try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed

M09908000,"\h(«Drachma»)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908001,"\h(«Drachma»)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully made it
through there.\e"
M09908002,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow…
Sounds like fun. Let's give it a shot.\e"
M09908003,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot! Don't take it so lightly! If it was that
easy, I wouldn't be warnin' you like this!\e"
M09908004,"\h(«Drachma»)Small ships are torn apart by the fierce winds.
Even large ships need considerable power to just
move forward.\e"
M09908005,"\h(«Drachma»)The Little Jack's engine isn't strong enough to
get through here. We must turn back.\c"
M09908006,"\h(«Drachma»)This is South Ocean, boy. I thought I told you
that we'd never make it through there alive.
Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908007,"\h(«Bellena»)The area before you is called South Ocean. I'd
turn back if I were you.\e"
M09908008,"\h(«Bellena»)There's a strong wind that blows from the west
here. This place is known among sailors as one
of the most difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908009,"\h(«Bellena»)Nobody has ever made it through this place. And
nobody knows what lies on the other side,
either.\e"
M09908010,"\h(«Aika»)Wow…
I suppose we'd never make it through in this
tiny ship.\e"
M09908011,"\h(«Bellena»)This ship would probably be torn apart instantly
in the fierce winds.\e"
M09908012,"\h(«Bellena»)We would need a much, much more powerful engine
even to have a chance of making it through
there.\e"
M09908013,"\h(«Aika»)You're probably right. And besides… we should
be looking for the Red Moon Crystal right now,
anyway. Alright Vyse! Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908014,"\h(«Bellena»)I told you that this is South Ocean. We'd never
make it through there. Turn the boat around.\c"
M09908015,"\h(«Drachma»)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908016,"\h(«Drachma»)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully sailed
through it.\e"
M09908017,"\h(«Vyse»)But the lands of the Green Moon are through
here, right?\e"
M09908018,"\h(«Vyse»)And besides, we have Belleza's engine now.
It's not like we don't have a chance of making
it through.\e"
M09908019,"\h(«Drachma»)Hmm…
Perhaps. But my knowledge of this place is
limited. You're on your own, boy.\e"
M09908020,"\h(«Drachma»)This isn't goin' to be an easy journey. Prepare
yourselves for the worst, kids.\c"
M09909910,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse! This is it! This is where the Red Moon
Crystal is buried!\e"
M09909911,"\h(«Vyse»)Great! Let's land this ship and search the place
right away!\e"
M09909912,\h(«Drachma»)……\e
M09909913,"\h(«Drachma»)… Wait, boy.
Head to town first. I've got some things that I
need to take care of.\e"
M09909914,"\h(«Drachma»)There's a port city named Maramba near here.
Go there first, got it?\e"
M09909915,"\h(«Vyse»)Um… sure. No problem. I just thought that we
could… um… never mind. It doesn't matter to
me.\c"
M09909916,"\h(«Drachma»)You can explore the temple later. Head to
Maramba first, boy.\c"
M09901100,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumph…
So this is the Iron Net. I've heard rumors about
it.\e"
M09901101,"\h(«Drachma»)I heard that the Valuans built this to prevent
people from coming here from North Ocean.\e"
M09901102,"\h(«Drachma»)I guess they didn't want anyone to find out
about this new land.\e"
M09901103,"\h(«Aika»)I hate to say this, but I don't think we're
going to be able to break through that thing.
We should turn back.\c"
M09901104,"\h(«Drachma»)We'll never be able to break through the Iron
Net, boy. Turn this boat around.\c"
M09909920,"\h(«High Priest»)Did you people come from the east?
Then I have nothing to talk to you about.
Go back to where you came from!\c"
M09909930,"\h(«Drachma»)This looks like the Valuan headquarters here
in these parts.\e"
M09909931,"\h(«Drachma»)Who knows what will happen if we just go
wanderin' around in there. We shouldn't get too
close, boy.\c"
M09901400,"\h(«Drachma»)What are you doin', boy?! Are you tryin' to
leave Valua?!\e"
M09901401,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah! Aren't we supposed to be looking for the
Yellow Crystal around here? Turn this boat
around Vyse!\c"
M09901402,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901403,"\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09901500,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey, hey! Where do you think you're going, Vyse?
That's Valuan homeland over there!\e"
M09901501,"\h(«Gilder»)Don't you think we have better things to do
than to pick another fight with the Valuans?
We should probably avoid this area.\c"
M09901502,"\h(«Aika»)Wait a second there, Fina. Isn't that Valua up
ahead?\e"
M09901503,"\h(«Aika»)What are we going to do with this little boat if
the Valuans decide to attack us? We probably
should stay out of there for now.\c"
M09901600,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901601,"\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09909940,"\h(«Aika»)Hey! Look over there! There's some kind of
vortex! Maybe we can go inside it!\e"
M09909941,"\h(«Enrique»)Ugh… Per… Perhaps we should head over to…
ugh… Esparanza, first…\e"
M09909942,"\h(«Enrique»)I don't know… how much longer I can take…
this before I… ulp!\e"
M09909943,"\h(«Aika»)Heh… I swear… What are we going to do with
you, Enrique? I suppose we have no choice for
now. Vyse, let's head over to Esparanza!\c"
M09909944,"\h(«Enrique»)Ugh…
Please… can't we just… stop by Esparanza
first? I'm begging you… ulp!\c"
M09909945,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like we can get inside the Dark Rift
through here. Enrique, are you ready?\e"
M09909946,"\h(«Enrique»)… Yes, I'm ready. I don't suppose I have much
of a choice at this point. We must get through
the Dark Rift no matter what.\e"
M09909947,"\h(«Enrique»)Don't mind me… I will be fine. This is neither
the time nor the place to be complaining about
airsickness.\c"
M09902400,"\h(«Gilder»)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09902401,"\h(«Gilder»)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09902402,"\h(«Fina»)Aika… It looks like we've gone a little too far
to the north.\e"
M09902403,"\h(«Aika»)I think you're right.
Who knows what's up ahead. It might be a little
dangerous to go exploring right now.\e"
M09902404,"\h(«Aika»)And from what I can tell of the map, Daccat's
Island probably isn't north of here anyway.
Let's turn around and continue searching.\c"
M09909952,"\h(«Gilder»)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09909953,"\h(«Gilder»)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09909950,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse… do not return to Crescent Isle. I beg of
you.\e"
M09909951,"\h(«Enrique»)If I go back now… I… I'm afraid that my
determination will falter. I cannot allow myself
to do that…\c"
M09909960,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this?
There's something set into the statue's eye
socket…\e"
M09909961,\h( )You found the “Golden Man's Eye.”\e
M09909962,"\h(«Aika»)Hey, no one will notice if it's missing, right?
And besides… we're Air Pirates!! Can you really
blame us for taking a little bit of treasure?\c"
M09909963,"\h(«Vyse»)Hm? Hey, Aika… do you see something glittering
on the ground? Right where the eye of that bird
would be…\e"
M09909964,"\h(«Aika»)Hey, you're right! Let me go down and see what
it is…\e"
M09909965,"\h(«Aika»)… Hey, Vyse! I found something! There was a gem
stuck into the ground! I'm sure they won't miss
a little, itty-bitty gem, would they?\e"
M09909966,\h( )You found the “Great Bird's Eye.”\e
M09909967,"\h(«Aika»)Besides, who knows when a nice little gem like
this will come in handy?\c"
M09909968,"\h(«Fina»)I…
I can't believe that they actually used the
Rains of Destruction…\e"
M09909969,\h(«Aika»)Fina…\e
M09909970,"\h(«Gilder»)… Vyse, maybe we should head back to Crescent
Isle and take a minute to regroup. We can't do
anything to get into Soltis right now, anyway.\e"
M09909971,"\h(«Vyse»)… You're right.
I really hate to do this, but it looks like we
have no choice but to just head home for now.\c"
M09909972,"\h(«Vyse»)There's an incredibly strong wind blowing from
inside the Dark Rift.\e"
M09909973,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like it's going to be tough to get
through there even with the Delphinus…\c"
M09909974,"\h(«Vyse»)Hm… It looks like we've come out of the Dark
Rift on the same side that we went in on.\c"
M09909975,"\h(«Aika»)On the treasure map it says, “The dead will
always watch over my treasure.”\e"
M09909976,"\h(«Aika»)And there's a skull here on the eastern part of
the Valuan continent. I wonder if that has to
do with anything…\c"
M09909977,"\h(«Vyse»)… What's this place? Why are there buildings
being built on an island way down here?!\c"
M09909994,"\h(«Vyse»)It's too dangerous to go back there right now.
And, besides… I shouldn't let Gregorio's
sacrifice be in vain.\c"
M09909995,"\h(«Aika»)This is the Armada's homebase. We probably
shouldn't get too close, or we'll be asking for
trouble. Let's just turn the ship around…\c"
M09909978,"\h(«Aika»)We did it!!
We actually made it through the Dark Rift!!\e"
M09909979,"\h(«Enrique»)Well! I can't believe that we are actually going
to be able to see what lies east of the Dark
Rift! We're making history as we speak!\c"
M09909980,"\h(«Aika»)Wow! There are so many herbs and spices growing
here! I've never seen so many in one place
before!\e"
M09909981,"\h(«Vyse»)It's amazing… This place truly is a treasure
island.\e"
M09909982,"\h(«Fina»)But we really shouldn't disturb the island too
much…\e"
M09909983,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah… I suppose that if we took too many of the
seeds and stuff that the trees might not be able
to grow back.\e"
M09909984,"\h(«Aika»)… But, I'm sure it would be okay just to take a
little bit, right Vyse?\e"
M09909985,"\h(«Vyse»)I swear, Aika. You and your “just a little bit.”
Alright, alright… we'll take something with us.\e"
M09909986,\h( )You received the spice “Khale.”\e
M09909987,"\h(«Drachma»)King Ixa'taka spoke of an Iron Net to the north
of this continent.\e"
M09909988,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah… But, if the Valuans escaped to the north,
that means they probably had to take down the
Iron Net, right?\e"
M09909989,"\h(«Drachma»)That means we'll be able to reach North Ocean
that way. We'll head straight to Valua from
there.\c"
M09909990,"\h(«Enrique»)In truth, the Delphinus has not yet been
completed.\e"
M09909991,"\h(«Enrique»)The hull hasn't been fully reinforced yet, so it
would probably be impossible to fly through
stone reefs at this point.\e"
M09909992,"\h(«Enrique»)And the engine's output settings haven't been
properly adjusted yet either, so we probably
won't be able fly through sky rifts.\e"
M09909993,"\h(«Engine»)However, if we can find some way to fix the hull
and the engine, I'm sure sky rifts and stone
reefs would pose no problem for this ship.\e"
M09909000,\h(«Dyne»)Wait… that's the legendary “Pirate's Grave!”\e
M09909001,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Good job, Vyse! I'm sure that the Sailors' Guild
would be more than happy to pay you for making
this Discovery!\e"
M09909002,"\h(«Vyse»)Guild?
Pay me for a Discovery?\e"
M09909003,"\h(«Dyne»)Much of this world is uncharted and shrouded
in legend. Ruins, strange creatures… all
sorts of things are waiting to be discovered.\e"
M09909004,"\h(«Dyne»)Any major port city will have a Sailors' Guild.
They pay explorers well for any information on
Discoveries that they've made.\e"
M09909005,"\h(«Dyne»)When you're flying through the skies and your
compass starts spinning around rapidly, that
means there's a Discovery nearby.\e"
M09909006,"\h(«Dyne»)If you try searching the area, you'll probably
find a Discovery. Just head over to the Sailors'
Guild afterwards and collect your reward.\e"
M09909007,"\h(«Dyne»)But, the longer you wait, the greater the chance
that someone else will beat you to it. So, you
should visit the Guild as soon as you can, okay?\c"
M09909008,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, before we set sail, do you have any
questions that you wanted to ask me?\e"
M09909009,"\h(«What will you say?»)“How do I steer this thing?”
“How do we get home from here?”
“No, not really.”\e"
M09909010,"\h(«Vyse»)Just to be safe, how exactly do I steer this
thing?\e"
M09909011,"\h(«Dyne»)I never thought I'd hear you ask something like
that. Heh… Nevertheless, pay close attention.\e"
M09909012,"\h(«Dyne»)Using the analog stick, you can move forward or
backward, and turn left or right.\e"
M09909013,"\h(«Dyne»)You can control your altitude by using the R and
L triggers. The R trigger will move the ship
upward and the L trigger will do the opposite.\e"
M09909014,"\h(«Dyne»)Whenever you want to search anything or whenever
you want to dock at a harbor, just press the
A button.\e"
M09909015,"\h(«Vyse»)Um… don't laugh at me, Dad… er… Captain, but
I don't remember the way home from here. Could
you tell me where to go?\e"
M09909016,"\h(«Dyne»)How do you expect to become a good sailor if you
don't pay attention to where you are?! Just head
southeast from here.\e"
M09909017,"\h(«Dyne»)You'll recognize the island when you see it…
hopefully. If you get lost, you can look at a
map using the Start button.\e"
M09909018,"\h(«Dyne»)Also, you'll run into monsters on occasion as
you're sailing. If you do, run out to the deck
and take 'em out.\e"
M09909019,"\h(«Dyne»)One word of warning: there are these monsters
called Maroccas that live around here. They're
pretty tough.\e"
M09909020,"\h(«Dyne»)If you're not doing much damage on your enemy,
try hitting the Y button to change the
properties of your weapon. It might work better.\c"
M09909021,"\h(«Dyne»)Well, then! Full speed ahead! Destination,
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909022,"\h(«Drachma»)That reminds me… you should have received
something called a “Captain's Stripe.”\e"
M09909023,"\h(«Drachma»)You'll receive one for every major battle that
you win. It's sort of like a trophy.\e"
M09909024,"\h(«Drachma»)If you “Use” a Captain's Stripe, it will make
your ship stronger.\e"
M09909025,"\h(«Vyse»)I see. Thanks for the advice, Captain.\c"
M09909026,"\h(«Drachma»)It looks like we picked up a “Magic Cannon” from
the lady admiral.\e"
M09909027,"\h(«Drachma»)Using this, we'll be able to fire cannonballs
charged with magical energy.\e"
M09909028,"\h(«Aika»)Just like Belleza was doing, right? That's
great! Vyse! Did you hear that?! We should
really put this thing to good use!\e"
M09909029,"\h(«Drachma»)Be careful though, boy. Using the Magic Cannon
uses up MP just like normal magic. So don't go
too crazy with it.\c"
