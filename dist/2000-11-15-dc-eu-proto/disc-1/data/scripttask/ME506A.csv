MA5060000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, Captain…
Do you have any ideas on how to fight
this thing?\e"
MA5060001,"\h(«Drachma»)Hmm…
You know as much about this thing as I do, boy.
Just stay up high and see what he does for now.\c"
MA5060002,"\h(«Aika»)What was that?!
A few more hits like that and we're done for!!\e"
MA5060003,"\h(«Drachma»)I… I can't believe it.
I've never seen such destructive power before…\c"
MA5060004,"\h(«Aika»)What are we supposed to do to beat that thing,
Captain?! There has to be something we can do!\e"
MA5060005,"\h(«Drachma»)Hmm… I don't know if we can destroy him, but
perhaps we can avoid his attacks.\e"
MA5060006,"\h(«Drachma»)If you remember when I saved… I mean, when I
picked you kids up, I attacked it with my
cannons and it threw it off balance.\e"
MA5060007,"\h(«Drachma»)So, what I'm thinkin' is that if we were to
concentrate our cannon fire right before it
attacks, we may throw its aim off.\e"
MA5060008,"\h(«Vyse»)I suppose it's worth a try.
What have we got to lose?
Let's give it a shot!!\c"
MA5060009,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah! We did it!
We knocked it off balance!\e"
MA5060010,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah, but… well… it doesn't look like we
did any damage to it, though…\c"
MA5060011,"\h(«Vyse»)I don't know how long we can keep this up.
It just feels like we're only prolonging our
own deaths… He's got to have a weakness…\e"
MA5060012,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Concentrate fire on its heads!”
“Let's try attacking its feet!”\e"
MA5060013,"\h(«Vyse»)Let's try attacking its heads! We may get hit
in the process, but we need to take a chance!
Let's bring the Little Jack in closer!\c"
MA5060014,"\h(«Vyse»)Try attacking its feet! They've got to be
supporting a lot of weight… That might be
its weakness!\c"
MA5060015,"\h(«Vyse»)Damn… Nothing. We got in as close as we could,
but our cannons did almost nothing to it.\c"
MA5060016,"\h(«Vyse»)Damn… I was hoping we might be able to topple
that thing over, but it didn't even flinch…\c"
MA5060017,"\h(«Drachma»)It's no use, boy. The only thing we're managin'
to do is damage our own ship. We can't continue
fightin' like this for much longer.\e"
MA5060018,"\h(«Drachma»)We must retreat for now. Get us out of range
of his attacks, boy. We need to think of a new
strategy for now.\e"
MA5060019,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Retreat and regroup.”
“Continue fighting.”\e"
MA5060020,"\h(«Vyse»)… You're right, Captain.
I suppose we've got no other choice.\e"
MA5060021,"\h(«Drachma»)Well then, full speed ahead!
Get out of range of that thing's attacks!\c"
MA5060022,"\h(«Vyse»)No! We must defeat him! We can't
run away now!!\e"
MA5060023,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot!
Never question my orders aboard
the Little Jack!\e"
MA5060024,"\h(«Drachma»)Even if, by some miracle, we were able to
defeat that thing, the Little Jack would
probably be torn to shreds!\e"
MA5060025,"\h(«Drachma»)And if that happened, do you think the lady
admiral would just sit their while we licked our
wounds?! We'd be a sitting target!!\e"
MA5060026,\h(«Vyse»)Damn!\e
MA5060027,"\h(«Drachma»)In order to fight, you need to learn first how
to survive. There's no point if you're just
goin' to get yourself killed, boy.\e"
MA5060028,"\h(«Drachma»)Now, full speed ahead!
Get us out of range of that thing's attacks!\c"
