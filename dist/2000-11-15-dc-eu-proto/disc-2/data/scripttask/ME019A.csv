MH0070000,"\h(«Aika»)The water is so clear… it's beautiful…
I wonder where we are?\e"
MH0070001,\h(«Vyse»)Huh?\e
MH0070002,"\h(«Yafutoman»)Wow…
That ship, it's so huge!\e"
MH0070003,"\h(«Yafutoman»)Are those Westerners?
They dress funny…\e"
MH0070004,"\h(«Yafutoman»)Hey, look!
Their hair isn't black!\e"
MH0070005,"\h(«Yafutoman»)I wonder what they eat to make their hair that
color?\e"
MH0070006,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…
My hair is really going to stand out over here.\e"
MH0070007,\h(«Loud Voice»)Invaders! Why have you come to Yafutoma?!\e
MH0070008,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)These lands are protected by Mount Kazai and the
Blue Moon! Under the sovereign reign of Lord 
Mikado, invaders will be punished!\e"
MH0070009,"\h(«Aika»)Yafutoma?
Is this really Yafutoma?\e"
MH0070010,\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Yes… you have invaded Yafutoman Lands.\e
MH0070011,"\h(«Aika»)We did it! We did it!
We're in Yafutoma!!!!!\e"
MH0070012,"\h(«Enrique»)Well done, Vyse!
This will be recorded in the history books!\e"
MH0070013,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)How dare you invade our lands! 
I shall strike you down where you stand!\e"
MH0070014,\h(«Loud Voice»)Wait! Don't attack them!\e
MH0070015,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Visitors, our primary responsibility is to
defend Yafutoma. Please forgive our rush to
arms.\e"
MH0070016,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Lord Mikado has said that he would like 
to speak with you. Please, if you would 
come with me.\e"
MH0070017,"\h(«Vyse»)Lord Mikado?
I suppose that he is probably the king of these
lands. We should follow him.\e"
MH0130000,\h(«Vyse»)No!!!\e
MH0130001,"\h(«Vyse»)Belleza!
… And Vigoro?!\e"
MH0130002,"\h(«Belleza»)Well, well… hello there, handsome. 
Haven't seen you in a while.\e"
MH0130003,"\h(«Vigoro»)Hey, Red!
It looks like fate has brought us together
again.\e"
MH0130004,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, no!!
What's he doing here?!\e"
MH0130005,"\h(«Vigoro»)It's so cute how she pretends that she doesn't
want me. Come aboard my ship, maybe the two of
us can rock the boat.\e"
MH0130006,"\h(«Belleza»)Vigoro, please… 
We are in the presence of Prince Enrique.\e"
MH0130007,"\h(«Belleza»)Prince Enrique, I trust you are in good health.\e"
MH0130008,"\h(«Belleza»)If you are wondering how we got here, we 
blasted a hole in the stone reef near 
Ixa'taka and travelled west.\e"
MH0130009,"\h(«Belleza»)Our goal is the same, my Prince.
We also seek the Blue Crystal.\e"
MH0130010,\h(«Enrique»)What?!\e
MH0130011,"\h(«Vyse»)Belleza…
Do you plan to burn down Yafutoma as well?!\e"
MH0130012,"\h(«Belleza»)Relax, handsome.
As I told you before, I am against unnecessary
destruction.\e"
MH0130013,"\h(«Belleza»)We have no intention of fighting with you.
We were merely planning to dock and speak with
the king of these lands.\e"
MH0130014,"\h(«Vyse»)You are wasting your time. King Mikado is an
honorable man. There's no way he would strike a
deal with the Valuan Armada.\e"
MH0130015,\h(«Belleza»)We'll see about that…\e
MH0130016,"\h(«Belleza»)Everyone has their limits, their codes, their
morals. But everyone also has a weakness. \e"
MH0130017,"\h(«Belleza»)If you find that weakness and exploit it, those
limits, codes, and morals seem to fade away.\e"
MH0130018,"\h(«Belleza»)I'd love to chat longer, but I have an
appointment with the king. Stay out of our way.\e"
MH0130019,\h(«Vyse»)…\e
MH0130020,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse!
Shouldn't we stop them?!\e"
MH0130021,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Stop them by force!”
“Wait and see what happens.”\e"
MH0130022,"\h(«Vyse»)We can't let Belleza manipulate the king.
We've got to stop them… \e"
MH0130023,"\h(«Enrique»)Wait, Vyse! There are too many Valuan Soldiers
here. There's no way we can win.\e"
MH0130024,"\h(«Enrique»)Belleza and Vigoro are here as Imperial
Emissaries. If we attack them during a
diplomatic meeting, we'll lose the king's trust.\e"
MH0130025,\h(«Vyse»)… I suppose it's no use.\e
MH0130026,"\h(«Enrique»)Let's return to our quarters. We should wait
there until we have a chance to talk to the
king. \e"
MH0130027,"\h(«Vyse»)Sorry, but there's nothing we can do right now.
There's no way we can take on all of these
soldiers.\e"
MH0130028,\h(«Aika»)We can't even get to the Delphinus right now…\e
MH0130029,"\h(«Enrique»)Belleza and Vigoro are here as Imperial
representatives. Attacking them during a
diplomatic meeting would make us criminals.\e"
MH0130030,"\h(«Enrique»)Let's return to our quarters. There we will wait
until they have concluded their talks.\e"
M08020000,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)I understand that you wish to go to Mt. Kazai?
Lord Mikado has commanded me to escort you.\e"
M08020001,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Before departing, would you like to buy some
Ship Parts? Let me know when you are ready. We
can start any time you wish.\e"
M08020002,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Proceed to Mt. Kazai.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08020003,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Then let's get going to Mt. Kazai. I'll get the
ship under way, so you guys can just sit back
and take it easy.\e"
M08020004,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Oops, I almost forgot. If we're going to go
inside Mt. Kazai, I'd better take this along.\e"
M08020005,\h( )You received the “Underwater Suit.”\e
M08020006,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Deep inside Mt. Kazai is a cavern, and in some
places there will be water.
This Underwater Suit should come in handy.\e"
M08020028,"\h(«Aika»)What?! We have to go underwater?!
But I can't swim!!!\e"
M08020029,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Do not worry… As long as you are using the
Underwater Suit, you should be fine. Just be
sure to breathe normally.\e"
M08020007,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Well, then, shall we be going?
Make way for Mt. Kazai!\c"
M08020008,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Oh? So you don't want to go to Mt. Kazai after
all? Well, I'll be right here, so if you decide
to go later just give me a holler. \e"
M08020009,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Have you completed your preparations for
Mt. Kazai? We can depart any time you wish.\e"
M08020010,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Proceed to Mt. Kazai.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08020011,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)All right, then, let's get under way to
Mt. Kazai!\e"
M08020012,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Oh? So you don't want to go to Mt. Kazai after
all? Well, I'll be right here, so if you decide
to go later just give me a holler. \e"
M08020013,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)You were actually able to return from Mt. Kazai
with the legendary Maga Sphere. I couldn't be
more pleased to have taken you.\e"
M08020014,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08020015,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)All this time I thought that business about the
Maga Sphere was just an old fairy tale.
I can hardly believe they really exist.\e"
M08020016,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Well, don't be wasting your time, then. Hurry up
and take the Maga Sphere to Lord Mikado.\c"
M08020017,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)I've heard that a strange fleet of black steel
ships has appeared off the coast. Just to be
safe, you might want to buy some ship parts. \e"
M08020018,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08020019,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)You could say the same thing about your ships,
but those steel ships of the Westerners are
completely different from our ships. \e"
M08020020,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Still, even your ships can't seem to climb as
high into the sky as our ships can. \e"
M08020021,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Thanks for stopping by.
Come again.\e"
M08020022,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Not only did you folks manage to rout that black
steel fleet, you crushed that monstrous bird as
well! Will wonders never cease?!\e"
M08020023,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)I don't suppose my merchandise is of much
interest to you folks at the moment, but you
still might want to take a look around.\e"
M08020024,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08020025,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)In a battle between ships, it's not just a
matter of numbers. What really counts is how
powerful the main ships are.\e"
M08020026,"\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Once you've shot down the enemy's flagship and
heavy battleships, the rest of the fleet will
crumble easily.\e"
M08020027,\h(«Ship Parts Merchant»)Thanks for stopping by! Come again!\e
M08160000,"\h(«Fisherman»)I got one, I got one, I got one! Don't talk to
me now! I've gotta land him this time!\e"
M08160001,"\h(«Fisherman»)For fish that taste as good as sashimi, you have
to go into the water. I'm gonna catch me a few
and have them for dinner tonight!\c"
M08160002,"\h(«Fisherman»)For fish that taste as good as sashimi, you have
to go into the water. I'm gonna catch me a few
and have them for dinner tonight!\c"
M08160003,"\h(«Fisherman»)In the skies high above Yafutoma, you can
sometimes find rare fish called “Hamahai
fish.”\e"
M08160004,"\h(«Fisherman»)On the other hand, there are also fish down
below Yafutoma as well. I wish I could catch one
of those fish at least once in my life…\c"
Ms019a000,"\h(«Vyse»)This is a strange container.
It's packed full of small, white
grains…\c"
Ms019a001,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… An interesting looking barrel. And it
looks like it's filled with…! Loqua!
I guess they drink loqua here, too.\c"
Ms019a002,"\h(«Vyse»)Whoa, look at the face on this statue.
It sort of reminds me of Pow… Just a whole lot
scarier. I wonder if it's a Yafutoman animal…\c"
Ms019a003,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, Yafutoman ships aren't all that
different from ours. The difference is probably
the Moon Stones that they use as fuel, then.\c"
Ms019a004,"\h(«Vyse»)What a strange suit of armor.
I wonder if the Yafutomans actually wear
that thing in battle…\c"
Ms019a005,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a Yafutoman diving suit, made of scales and
oiled paper. It's looks so heavy… It's probably
hard to walk on land while wearing that thing.\c"
Ms019a006,"\h(«Vyse»)The Delphinus can't fly at high altitudes,
so while we're here, we may as well use
Yafutoman ships.\c"
Ms019a007,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little longer.”\c"
