MF0270000,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey, Vyse!
I believe that's what we came here for!
Heh, Daccat's Treasure.\e"
MF0270001,"\h(«Vyse»)That's got to be it!
Heh, now I can buy my ship.\e"
MF0270002,"\h(«Aika»)Wow! Look, Fina! Look!!!
That treasure chest is HUGE!!!\e"
MF0270003,"\h(«Fina»)Oh, yes… I see it!
Do you think it's Captain Daccat's Treasure?\e"
MF0270004,\h(«Vyse»)Who's there?!\e
MF0270005,\h(«Aika»)Who's there yourself?\e
MF0270006,"\h(«Aika»)Oh!!!
Vyse…! It's Vyse!!\e"
MF0270007,\h(«Fina»)Vyse!!\e
MF0270008,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika!
Fina!
You're both okay!!\e"
MF0270009,\h(«Aika»)Vyse!!!\e
MF0270010,"\h(«Aika»)You're alive! We raised enough money to buy a 
boat and we were gonna go looking for you! 
As soon as we got the treasure, of course.\e"
MF0270011,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse…
I'm so glad that you are alright…\e"
MF0270012,"\h(«Fina»)Oh, I'm sorry…
I'm a little emotional right now.
I'm just so happy!!!\e"
MF0270013,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika… Fina…
I was so worried. I was gonna buy a boat to look
for you, too.\e"
MF0270014,\h(«Gilder»)Heh! Well look at you… \e
MF0270015,"\h(«Gilder»)On top of that, I didn't know that your partner 
was the cutie that I met in Nasr!\e"
MF0270016,\h(«Aika»)We're all together again!\e
MF0270017,\h(«Vyse»)Aww… Now what?!\e
MF0270018,\h( )Aika and Fina have joined your party.\e
MF0380000,"\h(«Gilder»)Heh…
Let's see what the greatest Air Pirate of all 
time has to offer.\e"
MF0380001,\h(«Gilder»)… What?\e
MF0380002,\h(«Gilder»)What's this?!\e
MF0380003,\h(«Vyse»)What the?!\e
MF0380004,"\h(«Aika»)A piece of paper…
And a single gold coin?\e"
MF0380005,"\h(«Vyse»)“Brave souls that come seeking my treasure, do 
not be discouraged. You already have the most 
valuable treasures in the world.”\e"
MF0380006,"\h(«Vyse»)“Comrades, trust, and cooperation.
Those are the only true treasures in this world.
                                         Daccat”\e"
MF0380007,\h(«Vyse»)“Daccat”…\e
MF0380008,\h(«Vyse»)I don't believe this…\e
MF0380009,\h(«Aika»)That's it? No gems… No jewels?!\e
MF0380010,"\h(«Gilder»)HAHAHAHAHA!!!
I didn't know that Daccat had such a great sense
of humor. \e"
MF0380011,"\h(«Gilder»)I haven't laughed this hard in a long time! A 
good laugh beats a bunch of gold any day.\e"
MF0380012,"\h(«Fina»)Well, this treasure has brought us all back 
together… and friends are more important 
than any treasure.\e"
MF0380013,"\h(«Aika»)I understand that friends are important… but he
could've at least threw in a little something 
for our trouble!\e"
MF0380014,"\h(«Aika»)First it was the Lost City… then it was
Daccat's Treasure… All of these old legends
haven't paid off one bit.\e"
MF0380015,"\h(«Vyse»)Hahaha! I'll bet the greatest Air Pirate of all
time spent all of his gold while he was still 
alive. You can't take it with you, y'know.\e"
MF0380016,"\h(«Aika»)Some old bag of bones is in his grave laughing 
at us right now!!! We ran around like idiots the
whole time. And we're still poor!\e"
MF0380017,\h( )You received “Daccat's Coin.”\e
M01150000,"\h(«Aika»)Hey! Why won't this door open?! It won't even
budge!!\e"
M01150001,"\h(«Fina»)There's something written here… It's an old
language, but I think I can read it…\e"
M01150002,"\h(«Fina»)“When the two become one, the path will
reveal itself to you…”\e"
M01150003,"\h(«Aika»)What's that supposed to mean?! Why is Daccat
being so stingy?! It's not like any of his gold
means anything to him anymore!!!\c"
M01150004,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, great! More doors that won't open!
I really don't get what Daccat was thinking when
he built this place…\c"
M01150005,"\h(«Vyse»)Another door…
Damn… This one won't budge either.\c"
M01150006,\h(«Vyse»)A lever? I wonder what it's for…\c
M01150007,"\h(«Aika»)Doors that open by themselves… Levers that we
have no idea what they do… I really, really
don't get this place.\c"
M01150008,"\h(«Aika»)Another door?  Just great… But wait, what's
this stone tablet on the ground for?\c"
M01150009,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… There's probably some trick to opening
this door, too.\c"
M01150010,"\h(«Aika»)Another door with a stone tablet on the ground.
Well, it worked when we stepped on the tablet
last time…\c"
M01150011,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like I have to step on this tablet
to open the door. I think I just have to stand
here for a certain length of time or something…\c"
M01150012,"\h(«Aika»)Another door with a stone tablet on the ground.
Well, it worked when we stepped on the tablet
last time…\c"
M01150013,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like I have to step on this tablet
to open the door. I think I just have to stand
here for a certain length of time or something…\c"

M01150015,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like I have to step on this tablet
to open the door. I think I just have to stand
here for a certain length of time or something…\c"
M01150016,"\h(«Vyse»)It seems like the legendary Air Pirate
Daccat had a pretty good sense of humor.\c"
M01150017,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Return to your ship.”
“Stay here for a little while longer.”\c"
M01150018,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Return to your ship.”
“Stay here for a little while longer.”\c"
M01150019,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here for a little while longer.”\c"
