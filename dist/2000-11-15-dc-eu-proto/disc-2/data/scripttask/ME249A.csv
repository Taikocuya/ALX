ML0010000,"\h(«Vyse»)What's wrong?
Why did we stop?\e"
ML0010001,\h(«Fina»)I remember hearing about a Dome of Light.\e
ML0010002,\h(«Vyse»)Dome of Light?\e
ML0010003,"\h(«Fina»)Yes, it was an ancient defense mechanism… \e"
ML0010004,"\h(«Fina»)It was able to protect Soltis from the Gigas. 
Galcian is using it to protect himself from us.\e"
ML0010005,\h(«Vyse»)We've got to find a way through it!\e
ML0010006,"\h(«Galcian»)Heh heh heh… 
The Dome of Light is impenetrable… 
Not even the Delphinus can touch us.\e"
ML0010007,"\h(«Galcian»)Ramirez…
I believe the world needs a demonstration of our
power!\e"
ML0010008,\h(«Ramirez»)As you wish.\e
ML0010009,\h(«Galcian»)Valua could use a little rain… \e
ML0010010,"\h(«Galcian»)Silver Gigas, Zelos! Obey my command!
Call forth the Rains of Destruction from the 
Yellow Moon.\e"
ML0010011,"\h(«Vyse»)Is that…?!
No… \e"
ML0080000,"\h(«Galcian»)My first stop is Nasr. Since we've already 
destroyed Nasrad, they will beg for mercy, 
especially after what we did to Valua.\e"
ML0080001,"\h(«Ramirez»)My lord…
Shall I accompany you?\e"
ML0080002,"\h(«Galcian»)It is not necessary. If any countries resist, 
I shall destroy them with the Rains.\e"
ML0080003,"\h(«Galcian»)I need you here to defend Soltis and to 
command Zelos to rain down on our enemies.\e"
ML0080004,\h(«Ramirez»)A wise decision… \e
ML0080005,"\h(«Watch Officer»)My lord!
An unknown fleet of ships is headed this way at
attack speed. I can't identify the fleet, but… \e"
ML0080006,\h(«Watch Captain»)Leading the charge is the… Delphinus… \e
ML0080007,"\h(«Galcian»)So, the Air Pirates have come to challenge me. 
It saves me the trouble of hunting them down… 
I shall purge the skies of their kind forever!\e"
ML0080008,"\h(«Ramirez»)Lord Galcian…
Perhaps I should go as well…\e"
ML0080009,"\h(«Galcian»)No. We cannot lose Soltis.
Return at once!\e"
ML0080010,"\h(«Galcian»)Do not worry.
The Hydra will dispose of them.\e"
ML0080011,"\h(«Galcian»)Air Pirates… it will rain today indeed. 
The skies shall weep with your blood!\e"
ML0080012,"\h(«Galcian»)All ships, full speed ahead!
Destroy the Air Pirates… 
Destroy every last one of them!\e"
ML0080013,\h(«Aika»)The Armada is closing fast!\e
ML0080014,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright, battlestations!!! \e"
ML0080015,\h(«Vyse»)This is it!!!\e
ML0100000,"\h(«Watch Officer»)My lord! The Air Pirates have broken our lines!
The Delphinus is headed straight for us!\e"
ML0100001,"\h(«Galcian»)Heh heh…
Well done, Vyse.\e"
ML0100002,"\h(«Galcian»)You shall live just long enough to feel the 
destructive power of the Hydra!\e"
ML0100003,\h(«Galcian»)All cannons fire on the Delphinus!!!\e
ML0100004,\h(«Aika»)There's an enemy ship ahead! It's huge!!!\e
ML0100005,\h(«Enrique»)No… it can't be!\e
ML0100006,"\h(«Vyse»)Enrique, you know this ship?\e"
ML0100007,"\h(«Enrique»)It's called the Hydra. It was dubbed, 
“The Flying Fortress.” Galcian must 
have had his own men complete it!\e"
ML0100008,"\h(«Enrique»)My mother wanted it's production stopped 
because of its magnitude.\e"
ML0100009,"\h(«Gilder»)Why, wasn't it big enough?\e"
ML0100010,\h(«Fina»)Galcian must be in there!\e
ML0100011,"\h(«Vyse»)This battle won't be over until we destroy that
thing!\e"
ML0100012,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright, Galcian!
It ends now!\e"
ML0160000,\h(«Aika»)Vyse… Something bad is happening!!!\e
ML0160001,\h(«Vyse»)…!\e
ML0160002,"\h(«Vyse»)No! Ramirez is going to use the Rains of
Destruction again!!!\e"
ML0160003,\h(«Aika»)There's nothing we can do to stop him!\e
ML0160004,\h(«Fina»)Ramirez… please…\e
ML0160005,"\h(«Fina»)…!
Elders… oh, no… \e"
ML0160006,"\h(«Vyse»)What's wrong, Fina?!\e"
ML0160007,\h(«Aika»)Vyse! Look!\e
ML0160008,"\h(«Elder Orbis»)Fina…
Soltis used to be our home.\e"
ML0160009,"\h(«Elder Orbis»)We created it… from nothing… and now we must
destroy it… \e"
ML0160010,"\h(«Elder Orbis»)For a thousand generations… we have judged the
people of this world… \e"
ML0160011,"\h(«Elder Orbis»)Everything we have created… Soltis… Zelos… 
The Rains… was all because these people 
did not measure up to our standards… \e"
ML0160012,\h(«Elder Orbis»)But… perhaps we were wrong.\e
ML0160013,"\h(«Elder Orbis»)Fina, by believing in the people of this world, 
you have taught us a great deal.\e"
ML0160014,"\h(«Elder Orbis»)We sent you here to help us destroy the world,
but now we are going to help you save it.\e"
ML0160015,"\h(«Elder Orbis»)There is no need to be sad… If we had not
created the Rains of Destruction, the world
would not be in jeopardy.\e"
ML0160016,"\h(«Elder Orbis»)Please… for the sake of the future… for the
sake of this world… you must prevail!\e"
