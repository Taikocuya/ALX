items, anything and everything for your shopping

M06070001,"\h(«Aika»)You really do have lots of stuff… 
Unfortunately, I have to be careful about 
wasteful spending right now, so…\e"
M06070002,"\h(«Sundries Stall Boy»)Aw, shucks! Well stop by again some other time,
sis!\c"
M06070003,"\h(«Sundries Stall Boy»)Hello! Hello! Get it cheap! Get it cheap!

M06070006,"\h(«Sundries Stall Boy»)My dad flies all over the world looking for
Daccat's treasure.\e"
M06070007,"\h(«Sundries Stall Boy»)Meanwhile, I sell all the other junk he 
discovers on his journeys. \e"
M06070008,"\h(«Sundries Stall Boy»)He's always grumbling--if not the treasure,
couldn't he at least find some memorabilia?
Even that would be worth a whole lot of money.\e"
M06070009,"\h(«Sundries Stall Boy»)May the Red Moon shine upon you! Stop in again 
sometime!\c"
M06080000,"\h(«Fruit Vendor»)Good day! Good day! How about some nice, fresh 
fruit? How about some luscious, juicy fruit to 
quench your thirst?\e"
M06080001,"\h(«Fruit Vendor»)Buy some now, before the monkey eats it all! 
Scrumptiously delicious fru-u-uit!\c"
M06110000,"\h(«Sailor»)A map or some memorabilia... There must be
something that will offer me a hint about where
the treasure is. \e"
M06110001,"\h(«Sailor»)I've figured out that the island where Daccat
hid his treasure has to be near here somewhere,
but now I need something more specific.\c"
M06140000,"\h(«Young Woman»)Wow! Look at the crowds! I am from Maramba, and 
I do not think I have ever seen so many people 
in one place before.\e"
M06140001,"\h(«Young Woman»)With merchants from all over the world, the 
place is full of things I have not seen before. 
The big city really is a different world.\c"
Ms013c000,"\h(«Vyse»)This plate… it's made of pure silver!
It looks expensive, but it's just sitting out
here with the rest of the junk…\c"
Ms013c001,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a bag with a picture of a Dhabu on it.
Aika would probably love this.\c"
Ms013c002,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh wow… that looks tasty!
And it smells too good!\c"
Ms013c003,"\h(«Vyse»)The meat's been wrapped into various packages.
They're a little too big to steal, though.\c"
Ms013c004,"\h(«Vyse»)There's all kinds of medicine I've never seen
before. There might be something interesting
for sale here…\c"
Ms013c005,"\h(«Vyse»)A miniature Dahbu, some accessories…
I suppose lots of travelers come through here,
so there's a lot of souvenirs.\c"
Ms013c006,"\h(«Vyse»)Hm? “Live Nasr Scorflies?”
I'm not sure that's something I'd buy. Wait… I
can hear something moving inside the box…\c"
Ms013c007,"\h(«Vyse»)These are Nasr rugs.
I heard they were really expensive,
but I guess these are the cheap kind.\c"
Ms013c008,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Hey!
Don't be stealing my goods
now, you hear?!\c"
Ms013c009,\h(«Vyse»)It says “Nasr Army surplus.”\c
Ms013c010,"\h(«Vyse»)Now, that's a big sword!
That could probably slice through anything.
Looks sorta heavy, though.\c"
Ms013c011,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a bunch of swords just thrown in here.
I guess they're selling blades with nicks
and scratches for cheap.\c"
Ms013c012,"\h(«Vyse»)There are all kinds of berries piled up
in here. They look fresh, too…\c"
Ms013c013,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, fresh fruit!
Just looking at fruit right now makes
my mouth water…\c"
Ms013c014,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a Nasr rug.
It looks like they're selling irregular rugs
for cheap.\c"
Ms013c015,"\h(«Vyse»)This is certainly an interesting item of
clothing. I'm not exactly sure what it is,
but it sure is interesting…\c"
Ms013c016,"\h(«Vyse»)Huh? I wonder how you're supposed to wear
this thing?\c"
Ms013c017,"\h(«Aika»)Wow!
These silver plates are really cheap!
But… I can't waste money now…\c"
Ms013c018,"\h(«Aika»)How cute!
It's a bag with a picture of a Dhabu on it!
I wish I had some money to spare right now…\c"
Ms013c019,"\h(«Aika»)Mmm… Looks good…
I feel like I could just
eat the whole thing!\c"
Ms013c020,"\h(«Aika»)They've cut up the meat and wrapped it.
I don't know… If I was going to buy some meat,
I'd rather just buy the whole thing.\c"
Ms013c021,"\h(«Aika»)They have all kinds of medicine.
I guess they have a lot of rare items for sale
at the bazaar here.\c"
Ms013c022,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, wow!
It's a miniature Dhabu! It's so cute!
This blue stone is pretty, too!\c"
Ms013c023,"\h(«Aika»)“Live Nasr Scorflies?!”
… There's something moving around inside!
Yuck!\c"
Ms013c024,"\h(«Aika»)It's a Nasr rug.
I heard they were really expensive,
but this one looks pretty cheap.\c"
Ms013c025,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Hey! You!
Don't be trying to steal
my wares, now!\c"
Ms013c026,\h(«Aika»)Hmm… “Nasr Army surplus.”\c
Ms013c027,"\h(«Aika»)Wow, that's a big sword! I don't want to be a
liar and say that I'd be able to keep my balance
if I tried to use that.\c"
Ms013c028,"\h(«Aika»)They're selling damaged swords
for really cheap. I don't know about these…
They don't look too sturdy…\c"
Ms013c029,"\h(«Aika»)Mmm, looks good!
It's full of all sorts of berries!\c"
Ms013c030,"\h(«Aika»)Wow, fresh fruit!
You get thirsty a lot in Nasr,
so the fruit looks even better!\c"
Ms013c031,"\h(«Aika»)It's a Nasr rug.
I guess they're selling dirty ones and
damaged ones for cheap.\c"
Ms013c032,"\h(«Aika»)Wow…
I… I don't think I could wear that…\c"
