Ms028f000,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a map of the entire world. There are
smudges all over it and there's a bunch of stuff
written in some foreign language…\e"
Ms028f007,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez used to love looking at maps… He said
that it made the world look so small… I never

Ms028f001,"\h(«Fina»)It's an entire history of the world written in

He used to tell me that all he wanted to do was
just “sail through the vast skies of the world.”\c"
Ms028f009,"\h(«Fina»)This…

before… before he joined with Valua.\c"
