Ms034c000,"\h(«Vyse»)The Delphinus may be nice and all, but I really
miss a good sailboat…\c"
Ms034c001,"\h(«Vyse»)I miss sailing in a sailboat…
But hey! What am I doing?! This is no time to
sit here and look at paintings!\c"
Ms034c002,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like a picture of a bunch of merchant
ships lined up in a harbor. This was probably
painted by someone who really likes ships…\c"
Ms034c003,"\h(«Vyse»)This really is a nice picture…
But, I don't have time to sit here and admire
paintings! I've got to get going!\c"
Ms034c004,"\h(«Vyse»)Today's specials… Let me see…
Mid Ocean style sauteed fish…
And “The Spice of the Sky.”\c"
Ms034c005,"\h(«Vyse»)Today's specials… Let me see…
Yafutoman style simmered Kabal steak…
And Marocca marinade…\c"
Ms034c006,"\h(«Vyse»)Today's meals were prepared by… Aika?
Great… that just means dry cereal and pickled
vegetables…\c"
Ms034c007,"\h(«Vyse»)Today's dinner is…
Wait a second… I don't have time to be thinking
about food right now!\c"
Ms034c008,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow… There are all kinds of expensive goods
scattered across the table. Where does Osman
find all this stuff?\c"
Ms034c009,"\h(«Vyse»)Everything's a mess! I better hurry up and
fix the ship!\c"
M00040000,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow! Pow pow!\c
M01000002,"\h(«Polly»)I've been hearing that Esparanza is populated by
Ex-Valuan soldiers and sailors who lost their
ships in the Dark Rift.\e"
M01000003,\h(«Polly»)Maybe my husband is there.\c
M01000004,"\h(«Polly»)I was hoping that my husband would be in 
Esparanza, but nobody there has heard of him.\e"
M01000005,"\h(«Polly»)I really hope he wasn't killed when he tried to 
make it through the Dark Rift.\c"
M01000006,"\h(«Polly»)I can't believe that we found Robinson. 
It's a miracle that he's still alive!\e"
M01000007,\h(«Polly»)Vyse… Thank you… I'm so happy I went with you.\c
M01000008,"\h(«Polly»)So, we made it through the Dark Rift…\e"
M01000009,"\h(«Polly»)I was really hoping that my husband was still 
alive… but after seeing all those shipwrecks… 
I just don't know.\c"
M01000010,\h(«Polly»)What's going on out there?\c
M01000011,"\h(«Polly»)So, we're going back to Crescent Island? I'm 
sure my husband will feel a lot better once I 
start cooking for him again.\c"
M01000012,"\h(«Polly»)We made it through the Dark Rift, but there were
no signs of my husband. There were so many
shipwrecks in there…\c"
M01000013,"\h(«Polly»)We're going to the Land of Ice, right? I'll 
start making some really hot soup for the 
crew.\c"
M01000014,"\h(«Polly»)I have this feeling that my husband is still 
alive… somewhere… I know that he wouldn't be 
in the Land of Ice.\c"
M01000015,"\h(«Polly»)We're going into Deep Sky, right? I hope the 
ship holds up under the pressure.\c"
M01000016,"\h(«Polly»)So, we're going underneath Valua? 
I never thought I'd ever go there.\c"
M01000017,"\h(«Polly»)Fina is trying to act like nothing is bothering
her, but I can tell it's just an act. Deep down
inside, she's really upset.\e"
M01000018,"\h(«Polly»)She didn't eat much to begin with, but now she 
barely even touches her food.\c"
M01000019,"\h(«Polly»)We've been all over the world, and I still 
haven't found my husband. I can't give up hope. 
I know he's out there… somewhere.\c"
M01000020,"\h(«Polly»)Enrique is really upset. I know he used to get
airsick all the time, but even when he got sick,
he still ate more than he does now.\e"
M01000021,"\h(«Polly»)I think he was hit very hard, emotionally.\c"
M01000022,"\h(«Polly»)We've been all over the world, and I still don't
know where my husband is. I have this feeling
that he's still alive… but where?\e"
M01000023,"\h(«Polly»)I've heard that Enrique will be leaving us 
soon…\e"
M01000024,"\h(«Polly»)I'll cook all of his favorite dishes until 
then.\c"
M01000025,"\h(«Polly»)An ancient continent rose from Deep Sky… in Mid
Ocean… I saw it happen, but I still don't
believe it.\c"
M01000026,"\h(«Polly»)I'll cook anything you want, when you come back.
Good luck, Vyse!\c"
M01000027,\h(«Polly»)What? Drachma was in the Land of Ice?\e
M01000028,"\h(«Polly»)Maybe if he dedicated his life to something 
other than destroying Rhaknam, he might find 
happiness.\c"
M04090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)A familiar island will look pleasantly 
unfamiliar.\e"
M04090001,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090002,"\h(«Kalifa»)A town that is deep inside the ice… there, arch
enemies will meet, and one will die.\e"
M04090003,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090004,"\h(«Kalifa»)Rest while you can, Vyse. There is much turmoil 
ahead.\e"
M04090005,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090006,"\h(«Kalifa»)A sleeping giant in a deep cavern… 
Does not always sleep deeply.\e"
M04090007,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090008,"\h(«Kalifa»)You will be reunited with an old friend, when 
this journey comes to an end.\e"
M04090009,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090010,"\h(«Kalifa»)A powerful enemy will confront you, and your 
crew will be faced with a difficult decision.\e"
M04090011,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)In the land, without light, evil eyes await your
arrival. Be careful, Vyse.\e"
M04090013,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)At the crossroad, connecting two lands, a shadow
is cast on your path.\e"
M04090015,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)The evil… will reach down into the darkness,
and bring light. The light will bring death.
Beware, Vyse.\e"
M04090017,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090018,"\h(«Kalifa»)The land that emerged from the darkness… will 
unleash a deadly light, but silver will be its 
downfall.\e"
M04090019,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090020,"\h(«Kalifa»)Kalifa, the third daughter of the Red Moon, will
pray with all her strength for your victory.\e"
M04090021,\h(«Kalifa»)mmmmmm……\e
M04090022,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaa!\c
M05030000,"\h(«Merida»)This stage is a little bit scary, because 
it's so small. Whenever the ship rocks, 
I feel like I'm going to fall off.\c"
M05030001,"\h(«Merida»)What's the matter? Is something wrong? You won
the battle, right? Or is there something else?\c"
M05030002,"\h(«Merida»)Enrique is going back to Valua? Valua is not a
pleasant place. If I was him, I would never go
back…\c"
M05030003,"\h(«Merida»)Ever since that continent resurfaced, there's 
been something in the air… something bad… 
something really bad.\c"
M05030004,"\h(«Merida»)I felt the pain of hundreds, and heard the cries
of one.\e"
M05030005,"\h(«Merida»)I will dance for you! My dance will bring you 
luck in your fight with the evil ones.\c"
M06310003,"\h(«Osman»)Isn't Esparanza that town that's full of poor
people on the southern tip of Nasr? I think I'll
stay on the ship.\c"
M06310004,"\h(«Osman»)If this was my ship, I'd never take it into the
Dark Rift. All the damage done by those winds
could really decrease the resale value.\c"
M06310005,"\h(«Osman»)So, this is the East. Hmm… Everything looks so
exotic. You can't get anything like this in the
West.\e"
M06310006,"\h(«Osman»)So that means that if I buy anything here, 
I'll be able to sell it back home for three 
times as much gold.\c"
M06310007,"\h(«Osman»)We're being raided by pirates?! Don't let them 
take my gold!!! And stop wasting time talking 
with me, go fight them!\c"
M06310008,"\h(«Osman»)As soon as we get back to Crescent Isle, I'm
going to start my own business. I'll be rich!!!\c"
M06310009,"\h(«Osman»)In Nasr, ice is a luxury only the Nasultan can 
afford.\e"
M06310010,"\h(«Osman»)If there truly is an entire continent covered in
ice, think about how much we can make if we can
haul chunks of it to Nasr!\c"
M06310011,"\h(«Osman»)The Valuans destroyed my shop in Nasr. Just
hearing the name Valua makes me mad. Let's leave
here as soon as possible.\c"
M06310012,"\h(«Osman»)So, now we have all the Moon Crystals? 
It's time to celebrate!\e"
M06310013,"\h(«Osman»)If one of them is worth a king's ransom, imagine
how much we can get for the entire set!\c"
M06310014,"\h(«Osman»)You're going to the Valuan base? Why waste your
time there? What do they have to steal… a bunch
of iron?\c"
M06310015,"\h(«Osman»)Hmm… Prince Enrique has been moping around
lately… I wonder if he and Moegi are fighting…\e"
M06310016,"\h(«Osman»)If they break up, I'll have a chance to marry a 
wealthy prince! I can't wait!\c"
M06310017,"\h(«Osman»)If he's going back to Valua, that must mean that
they're breaking up!\e"
M06310018,"\h(«Osman»)Now's my chance to seduce him. I'll have a rich
husband in no time. How could he possibly resist
me?\c"
M06310019,"\h(«Osman»)You didn't bring me anything from the Silver
Shrine?! Hrmph… See if I give you a discount on
anything…\c"
M06310020,"\h(«Osman»)An island rose from Deep Sky! This is a sign 
that the end is coming!\e"
M06310021,\h(«Osman»)I've got to find a way to protect my gold!\c
M06310022,"\h(«Osman»)Ever since that island showed up, business 
hasn't been the same! Go destroy it at once!\e"
M06310023,"\h(«Osman»)And after you destroy it, I'll give you a big 
wet kiss to show my appreciation!\c"
M06330000,"\h(«Khazim»)Alright everyone! Make sure to eat well and get
plenty of rest! You need to save your strength
for the battle!\e"
M06330001,\h(«Khazim's Men»)Yessir!\c
M06330002,"\h(«Khazim»)The enemy is boarding us?! They're too close for
us to use our cannons! Go get 'em, Vyse!\c"
M06330003,"\h(«Khazim»)I can't believe they escaped! They went straight
up, too! We never had a clean shot at them!\e"
M06330004,"\h(«Khazim»)Next time, we'll show them! We'll blast them 
full of holes!!!\c"
M06330005,"\h(«Khazim»)An entire continent made of ice? I've never 
actually seen ice before…\e"
M06330006,"\h(«Khazim»)I've heard that the Nasultan likes to eat 
crushed ice, but it's so rare, very few people 
from Nasr have ever seen it.\c"
M06330007,"\h(«Khazim»)Get ready! We need to be in shape for our next 
battle!\e"
M06330008,\h(«Khazim's men»)Yessir! We'll get 'em!\c
M06330009,"\h(«Khazim»)You guys need to get in shape! We need to be 
ready so we can get revenge on Ramirez!\e"
M06330010,"\h(«Khazim's Men»)Yessir! We'll be ready to kick some major 
butt sir!\c"
M06340000,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)We never get a chance to rest. Khazim is always
yelling at us!\c"
M06340001,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I can't believe that the guys from that weird 
dragon ship attacked us!\c"
M06340002,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I didn't expect to find Air Pirates on this side
of the world.\c"
M06340003,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)A continent made of ice? 
I can't even imagine that.\c"
M06340004,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I can't believe that continent rose from Deep
Sky! That was the most amazing thing that I've
ever seen!\c"
M06340005,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)The cannon's are ready when you are, Captain!\c"
M06350000,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I feel strange… Not having Khazim yelling at 
me every second of the day.\c"
M06350001,\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)An ambush! Hurry to the deck!\c
M06350002,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Honestly, I didn't think there would be anything
on the other side of the Dark Rift. I was really
shocked when I saw Air Pirates!\c"
M06350003,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I have never even seen ice. The only place there
is ice in Nasr is the ice room in the
Nasultan's Palace.\c"
M06350004,\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Is Galcian down there?\c
M06350005,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)We can get back at them for what they did to us
at Nasrad! I can't wait to attack them!\c"
M08030000,"\h(«Urala»)I'm a little scared. This is the first time that
I've ever been out of Yafutoma!\e"
M08030001,"\h(«Urala»)I hope the rest of your crew likes Yafutoman 
food as much as Aika!\c"
M08030002,"\h(«Urala»)It's still hard for me to believe that there is
a continent made entirely of ice.\e"
M08030003,"\h(«Urala»)In Yafutoma… they get snow from the mountains, 
and pour flavored syrup over it. It's really 
good.\c"
M08030004,"\h(«Urala»)Umm… when I first heard about the Land of Ice,
I thought they were exaggerating. I was shocked
when I saw it!\e"
M08030005,"\h(«Urala»)With that much ice, you can make all of the
desserts that you want! And you'll never need to
drink a warm drink again!\e"
M08030006,"\h(«Urala»)Um, I might be wrong, but I think Fina is upset 
about something.\e"
M08030007,"\h(«Urala»)She normally doesn't eat that much, but now she 
eats even less. I hope she's okay.\c"
M08030008,"\h(«Urala»)Um… I made Enrique some food, but he didn't eat
it.\e"
M08030009,"\h(«Urala»)At first, I thought it was my cooking, but 
everyone else enjoyed it. I hope Enrique is 
going to be okay.\c"
M08030010,"\h(«Urala»)Um… I want to make all of Enrique's favorite 
dishes for him… before he leaves.\e"
M08030011,"\h(«Urala»)I hope he and Moegi can spend some quality time
together, before he has to go.\c"
M08030012,\h(«Urala»)Um… I'm thinking about making a sweet dessert.\e
M08030013,\h(«Urala»)I hope that will cheer Fina up a little bit…\c
M08030014,"\h(«Urala»)Um… Captain, today, I'm going to cook all of 
your favorites…\e"
M08030015,"\h(«Urala»)You'll love it. And after we win this battle, 
we can all go back to Crescent Isle and 
celebrate!\c"
M08030016,\h(«Urala»)Huh? We're going inside the continent?\e
M08030017,"\h(«Urala»)Um…
I'm a little afraid of the dark… I hope we
don't stay there for too long…\c"
M08030018,"\h(«Urala»)Um, excuse me, Vyse? I might just be 
superstitious, but that island rising up from 
Deep Sky can't be a good thing.\e"
M08030019,\h(«Urala»)I'm really scared.\c
M08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, I do not know much about sailing, 
or what is going on outside of Yafutoma…\e"
M08070001,\h(«Moegi»)But I will try my best to help all of you.\c
M08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)A continent that is covered with ice… There are
mysterious places on this side of the world.\c"
M08070003,\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique told me about Drachma…\e
M08070004,\h(«Moegi»)I hope that he will be able to find peace.\c
M08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Although we are just going through the
continent, the thought that we're going to Valua
really upsets me.\c"
M08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Congratulations! I've heard that you have all 
the Moon Crystals now.\e"
M08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)But, I'm worried about Fina because she doesn't
seem to have much energy. Is she tired or
something?\c"
M08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)I am worried about Prince Enrique… he has been
depressed ever since he came back from Dangral
Island.\c"
M08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, I apologize for the way that 
I feel, but…\e"
M08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)I was hoping that something would happen to the
ship, so we wouldn't be able to go to Sailors'
Island… and Enrique could stay.\c"
M08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique is fighting by himself in Valua.
I will do my best to help, too.\c"
M08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)The continent that emerged from Deep Sky is 
frightening… There is something evil about it.\c"
M08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)I thought that I heard Prince Enrique screaming
for help…\e"
M08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)I saw the Moon Stones fall on Valua. I hope 
Prince Enrique is okay.\c"
M08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Let's go, Captain Vyse. I'm not a sailor, but I 
will do everything I can to help you.\c"
M08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)This ship is amazing! It's like being inside a 
castle!\c"
M08150001,"\h(«Kirala»)Were there any buildings under the ice? I want 
to hear all about them when you aren't too 
busy.\c"
M08150002,"\h(«Kirala»)I heard that the buildings were hanging from the
ceiling! I really wish I could have seen it.\c"
M08150003,"\h(«Kirala»)Congratulations! I heard that you found all
the… what do you call them… Oh, the Moon
Crystals!\c"
M08150004,"\h(«Kirala»)I heard that there is a rail that goes into Deep
Sky. I wonder how the Valuans built it.\c"
M08150005,"\h(«Kirala»)If you walk by Princess Moegi's room, you can 
hear her crying.\e"
M08150006,"\h(«Kirala»)She tries to hide her feelings when she's around
us… It must be really hard for her…\c"
M08150007,"\h(«Kirala»)What, we're going into Deep Sky?! But… there's 
monsters and ghosts and all kinds of bad things 
down there!\c"
M08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)What kind of crazy island comes up from Deep Sky
after hundreds of years anyway?! I don't like 
this at all. It can't be good!\c"
M08150009,"\h(«Kirala»)We've got a battle coming up! Let me know if I 
can do anything!\c"
M08150010,"\h(«Kirala»)I can't believe your ship couldn't fly above
or below the clouds. That's got to be 
inconvenient.\c"
M14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)A frozen city, buried under ice? That sounds 
impossible!\c"
M14010001,"\h(«Izmael»)So, you're telling me that all of the buildings 
were hanging from the ceiling like icicles?!\e"
M14010002,\h(«Izmael»)I'd have to see it to believe it!\c
M14010003,"\h(«Izmael»)That Book of Ship Polarity had some amazing
stuff in it… but can you believe Brabham? He's
still got some brains in that old noggin of his!\e"
M14010004,"\h(«Izmael»)Thanks to that old fart, this ship is the only
ship outside of Yafutoma that can fly up above
the clouds!\c"
M14010005,"\h(«Izmael»)What's wrong with the prince?
Has he got a stomachache or something?\c"
M14010006,"\h(«Izmael»)When you go into Deep Sky, make sure the 
shutters are closed. If we lose pressure, we'll 
be crushed!\e"
M14010007,"\h(«Izmael»)I don't know what to expect from down there, 
so be careful!\c"
M14010008,"\h(«Izmael»)I wonder what the architecture of the Great
Silver Shrine looks like… I'd like to see it
with you guys…\e"
M14010009,"\h(«Izmael»)I bet there are all kinds of old buildings on 
Soltis! I can't wait to see how they were 
built!\e"
M14010010,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse! Hurry up and kick their butts so we 
can go check out the architecture down there!\c"
M14010011,\h(«Izmael»)This is it! Let's get 'em!\e
M14010012,"\h(«Izmael»)I can't believe I'm fighting at my age. I'm just
trying to keep up with Brabham. Oh, but don't
tell him I told you that.\c"
M14010013,"\h(«Izmael»)When I first met Enrique, all I ever saw him do
was throw up over the side of the ship. Now he's
become quite a sailor!\e"
M14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)I'm impressed that he's got the nerve to go back
to Valua!\c"
M14020000,"\h(«Belle»)I'm so sorry, Captain… I, I'm a little clumsy.
I dropped a cannonball on someone's foot
earlier, too!\e"
M14020001,"\h(«Belle»)I'll try my best, though! Just give me some 
orders and I'll try not to mess up!\c"
M14020002,"\h(«Belle»)I was so surprised to see that the Lands of Ice
were actually lands of ice! I almost fell
overboard because I was so shocked!\e"
M14020003,"\h(«Belle»)When I regained my composure, I slipped on the 
ice and fell on my butt. I think I got some 
frostbite back there.\c"
M14020004,"\h(«Belle»)Finally, we're gonna try and make our way 
underground! I am not sure how well I can do 
this, but I am going to dig as much as I can!\e"
M14020005,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha… You don't have to dig!
There are natural fissures in the ground, so we
are going to enter there.\e"
M14020006,"\h(«Belle»)Really? Heh… heh heh… Oh, umm… That's good to
know. I was wondering how we were going dig
through a continent…\c"
M14020007,"\h(«Belle»)Captain, I think there's something wrong with 
Fina. She's usually quiet, but not this quiet.\e"
M14020008,"\h(«Belle»)I hope it's not because I spilled water all over
her when I tripped over the bucket.\c"
M14020009,"\h(«Belle»)I tried doing some magic tricks to cheer Enrique
up, but…\e"
M14020010,"\h(«Belle»)… he just sat there. He looked really sad. I 
can't seem to do anything right.\c"
M14020011,"\h(«Belle»)I'm sure that Moegi has been dying inside ever
since she found out Enrique was leaving, but…\e"
M14020012,"\h(«Belle»)… I can't believe she hasn't been crying more.
She's so disciplined. I wish I could be more
like her.\c"
M14020013,"\h(«Belle»)Where'd that island come from?! How can an 
island just appear out of nowhere?!\e"
M14020014,"\h(«Belle»)It caught me by surprise and I accidentally 
knocked over a bunch of cannonballs! 
Why am I so clumsy?!\c"
M14020015,"\h(«Belle»)We are finally going to try and attack that 
island! I know I'm clumsy and I keep messing 
things up, but…\e"
M14020016,"\h(«Belle»)I've learned a lot during my time here on the 
Delphinus! I think I'll be able to do a good 
job!\c"
M14090000,"\h(«Lilly»)The Land of Ice… it sounds so romantic.
I wonder what kind of men lived there?\c"
M14090001,"\h(«Lilly»)All I ever do is polish cannonballs all day…
How am I supposed to meet guys when I'm doing
this all the time?\c"
M14090002,"\h(«Lilly»)I heard that you found all of those Moon Crystal
things. Everyone keeps talking about how
beautiful they are…\e"
M14090003,"\h(«Lilly»)That's so romantic… I want a man who is willing
to risk everything to find something as
beautiful for me…\c"
M14090004,"\h(«Lilly»)Enrique is going back home and Moegi isn't going
with him?\e"
M14090005,"\h(«Lilly»)If I was her, I would never leave the side of 
the man that I love.\c"
M14090006,"\h(«Lilly»)Where exactly is Fina's homeland? Did you meet 
her family and stuff?\e"
M14090007,"\h(«Lilly»)Hmm… I bet you were a little nervous when you 
went there, huh Vyse? I mean… you and Fina are
getting kind of close… right?\c"
M14090008,"\h(«Lilly»)That handsome admiral is staying on that 
island that came up from Deep Sky?\e"
M14090009,"\h(«Lilly»)I swear… the best looking ones are always so 
weird. Why can't I just find a normal guy?\c"
M14090010,"\h(«Lilly»)Alright, let's do this! Heh… If I become the 
female pirate who helped save the world,
the guys won't be able to resist me!\e"
M14090011,"\h(«Lilly»)I am going to give it my best!
I know we can do it, Captain Vyse!\c"
M14090012,\h(«Lilly»)We're going… where?! Do we have to?\e
M14090013,"\h(«Lilly»)I was hoping that we'd get to see some… 
nicer places on our adventure.\c"
M14090014,"\h(«Lilly»)Enrique seems so… so… brave, nowadays. I
think that makes him kinda cute.\c"
M14100000,"\h(«Nara»)Just sitting here… polishing cannonballs under 
this beautiful sky… it's so relaxing.\c"
M14100001,"\h(«Nara»)That dragon sure was impressive. Was that thing 
one of those Gigas that you guys keep talking 
about?\c"
M14100002,"\h(«Nara»)You're going to sneak into a Valuan base and 
steal something? Wow… I'd be so nervous if I 
were you…\c"
M14100003,"\h(«Nara»)Enrique hasn't been himself lately… 
Maybe I should ask him to join us out here and 
have him polish some cannonballs!\c"
M14100004,"\h(«Nara»)Even though he's in Valua, and she's here, 
they're both fighting towards the same goal!\e"
M14100005,"\h(«Nara»)That is so romantic…
Moegi, just hang in there! Enrique loves you!\c"
M14100006,"\h(«Nara»)That island gives me the creeps… coming up from
beneath the clouds like that…\e"
M14100007,"\h(«Nara»)Personally, I think we should fire a couple of 
shots at the island, just to be safe.\c"
M14100008,"\h(«Nara»)Finally, we are going to face off with Ramirez…\e"
M14100009,"\h(«Nara»)We have enough cannonballs to get us through any
fight. Make sure and use as many as you can,
Captain Vyse!\c"
Mp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Esparanza…
I can't believe we have to go to the southern 
tip of Nasr… that's awfully far.\e"
Mp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, I knew this wasn't going to be easy. 
I suppose saving the world never is.\c"
Mp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Years ago, Valua sent an entire fleet to try and
get through the Dark Rift. All of the ships were
destroyed…\c"
Mp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)It's hard to imagine that we just came out of 
the Dark Rift. These lands are beautiful!\e"
Mp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Congratulations, Vyse! You're the first captain
to ever sail his ship through the Dark Rift.\c"
Mp0040009,\h(«Enrique»)I've never seen a ship rise like that!\e
Mp0040010,\h(«Enrique»)I wonder what kind of engine it's using…\c
Mp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)According to the “Spherical World Theory,” this
world is said to be round, but no one has ever
proven it.\e"
Mp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)If we continue east and see Crescent Island, 
then we actually can prove that theory 
is correct.\c"
Mp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)The Valuan Armada has sent many research groups 
to the Land of Ice, but…\e"
Mp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)They have been unable to break through the ice, 
so they have never been able to explore what 
lies beneath it.\c"
Mp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)We've acquired the Purple Moon Crystal, and now 
we should head back to Crescent Island. 
I do feel bad for Drachma, though…\e"
Mp0040016,\h(«Enrique»)The continent of Valua is full of canyons.\e
Mp0040017,"\h(«Enrique»)I assume that there are as many cracks and 
fissures beneath Valua, as well. There must be 
a way into the Maw of Tartas.\c"
Mp0040018,"\h(«Enrique»)Finally, we have gathered all the Moon Crystals.
Let's return to Crescent Island.\c"
Mp0040019,\h(«Enrique»)I wonder what Galcian is up to…\c
Mp0040020,\h(«Enrique»)………\c
Mp0040021,"\h(«Enrique»)A design that enables ships to travel into Deep
Sky… I wonder what the Armada is up to.\c"
Mp0040022,"\h(«Enrique»)I will miss sailing with you and your crew, 
Vyse. I hate to admit it, but I'll even miss 
Aika constantly teasing me, too.\c"
Mp0040023,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, I will be back… hopefully, soon.\c"
Mp0040024,"\h(«Enrique»)We've got to stop Ramirez! Vyse, I know we can 
do it!\c"
Mp0040025,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, will you let me go with you to Soltis?\e"
Mp0040026,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Of course.”
“We've got it under control.”\e"
Mp0040027,"\h(«Vyse»)Of course, you can come with us!
Without you, we never would have gotten the 
Delphinus. Let's go!\e"
Mp0040028,"\h(«Enrique»)Thank you, Vyse!
It is an honor to accompany you!\e"
Mp0040029,\h( )Enrique has joined the party.\c
Mp0040030,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, just let me know if I can help, and I
will!\c"
Mf1000000,\h(«Polly»)I know my husband is out there… somewhere…\c
Mf1000001,"\h(«Polly»)It must have been tough, being all alone in such
a dark and scary place…\e"
Mf1000002,"\h(«Polly»)I'm so glad I came with you, Vyse! 
Thank you so much!\c"
Mf1000003,"\h(«Polly»)The thought that the entire continent of Valua
is above us doesn't exactly fill me with 
confidence.\c"
Mf1000004,"\h(«Polly»)It's so creepy down here. Our food will start 
spoiling if we stay down here much longer.\c"
Mf4090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)I cannot hear the voice of the Red Moon from 
this horrid place. I cannot give you your 
fortune until we leave here.\c"
Mf5030000,"\h(«Merida»)It's so scary down here. I hope we can leave 
here… quickly…\c"
Mf5030001,"\h(«Merida»)I hate the Valuans. I want to leave here as 
soon as we can.\c"
Mf5030002,"\h(«Merida»)This place is rather unpleasant… A lot of
different energies are converging here. The air
is heavy, in a bad way…\c"
Mf6310000,"\h(«Osman»)Get out of here quickly! What are you going to 
do if we crash into something?\c"
Mf6310001,"\h(«Osman»)Personally, I'd prefer to be in a more cheerful
place. Nobody wants to buy things when they're
scared out of their wits.\c"
Mf6310002,"\h(«Osman»)This place gives me the creeps! And how am I
supposed to make any money down here?!\c"
Mf6330000,"\h(«Khazim»)Men! We need to work hard, so we can take down 
Valua!\e"
Mf6330001,\h(«Khazim's Men»)Yessir!\c
Mf6330002,"\h(«Khazim»)So, we're flying inside Valua. I wonder if we 
can destroy the place from the inside.\c"
Mf6330003,"\h(«Khazim»)Damn, this place is creepy! Ghosts and Nasrean
peppers are the two things that I hate the most!\e"
Mf6330004,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Yessir… Khazhim, you aren't supposed to eat 
Nasrean peppers. They are used to keep the 
monsters from the desert away.\c"
Mf6340000,\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)He yells at us all day long!\c
Mf6340001,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I never thought I'd see the inside of Valua, 
but now that I have, I wish I didn't.\c"
Mf6340002,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Isn't the underworld supposed to be full of 
ghosts?\c"
Mf6350000,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)It's weird not having Khazim yell at me every 
second. I kinda like it.\c"
Mf6350001,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Being inside of Valua isn't my idea of a 
good time.\c"
Mf6350002,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Khazim has always been afraid of ghosts. I think
he heard too many stories as a little kid.\c"
Mf8030000,\h(«Urala»)Um… I miss looking at the sky…\e
Mf8030001,"\h(«Urala»)I usually love looking out the windows of the 
ship, but I don't want to see what's out there 
right now.\c"
Mf8030002,"\h(«Urala»)Um… Is it true that there are a lot of scary 
monsters here?\e"
Mf8030003,"\h(«What are you going to say?»)“Yes, it's true.”
“No, those are just stories.”\e"
Mf8030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Yes, it's true. There are all kinds of hideous 
creatures lurking just outside that window.\e"
Mf8030005,"\h(«Urala»)Uhh… um… Vyse, please don't go back to the 
bridge… don't leave me alone down here…\c"
Mf8030006,"\h(«Vyse»)No, those are just stories. Don't worry about 
it. You'll be fine.\e"
Mf8030007,"\h(«Urala»)Thanks Vyse, I feel a little bit better… Not
all better… just a little. I'll be okay.
But can we leave soon?\c"
Mf8030008,"\h(«Urala»)There's all kinds of sunken ships outside. 
Vyse, I'm really scared.\c"
Mf8150000,"\h(«Kirala»)So, Valua was built on a giant craggy rock, 
where it's always dark and stormy… 
I'm impressed.\c"
Mf8150001,"\h(«Kirala»)I used to love fooling around when I was a kid, 
and my parents always got mad at me…\e"
Mf8150002,"\h(«Kirala»)They always told me they would throw me into
Deep Sky… I never thought that I'd actually
come here.\c"
Mf8150003,"\h(«Kirala»)The winds of the Dark Rift are incredible! Now I
know why the Westerners never came to
Yafutoma!\c"
Mf4010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam Baka Bam! I never would have imagined that 
these caverns existed in Valua!\c"
Mf4010001,\h(«Izmael»)This is a scary place.\e
Mf4010002,"\h(«Izmael»)This is depressing. I'm old enough as it is… 
I don't want to see what the underworld looks 
like yet.\c"
Mf4010003,"\h(«Izmael»)People have been trying to get through the Dark 
Rift, since I was your age. Ha! That was a long 
time ago!\c"
Mf4020000,"\h(«Belle»)Oh, I can't believe it! I left all of my candy 
on the deck!\c"
Mf4020001,"\h(«Belle»)Captain, I don't think there are ghosts in 
Deep Sky.\e"
Mf4020002,"\h(«Belle»)Oh, but now that I said the word ghosts, I'm 
thinking about them again! Great, I'm scaring 
myself!\c"
Mf4020003,"\h(«Belle»)Oops, I left everyone's laundry drying on the
deck!\e"
Mf4020004,"\h(«Belle»)By now, the laundry is probably all dirty from 
the air currents… Oh, I messed up again!\c"
Mf4f90000,"\h(«Lilly»)I heard that parts of Valua are really nice, 
but even the nice parts are no fun.\c"
Mf4f90001,"\h(«Lilly»)This is such a depressing place.
I don't like places like this.\e"
Mf4f90002,"\h(«Lilly»)When we get out of here, can we go to Ixa'taka, 
so I can try the food there?\c"
Mf4f90003,"\h(«Lilly»)The Dark Rift is really scary. Look at all of 
the ships that have been destroyed here. Let's 
get out of here soon.\c"
Mf41f0000,"\h(«Nara»)I like being in the dark. I think it's 
romantic.\c"
Mf41f0001,"\h(«Nara»)I keep expecting to see ghosts. I'm really 
scared, but when I get scared, I just get 
excited.\c"
Mf41f0002,"\h(«Nara»)So many adventurers have died here in the Dark 
Rift… This place is really creepy.\c"
Mf4030000,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)I wonder how much ore is in these walls. 
Think of the weapons that I could make.\c"
Mf4030001,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Deep Sky is not a place for the living. 
We don't belong here.\c"
Mf4030002,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)If you learn how to meditate, the worst storm 
will feel like a pleasant breeze.\c"
Mf4040000,"\h(«Robinson»)I never thought that I'd see Polly again!
I'm so happy!\c"
Mf4040001,"\h(«Robinson»)This gloomy cavern is still better than the 
Dark Rift.\c"
Mf4040002,"\h(«Robinson»)I really don't like it here! This place is worse
than the Dark Rift.\e"
Mf4040003,"\h(«Robinson»)If I was marooned down here, I don't think I'd
last a day.\c"
Mf4040004,"\h(«Ilchymis»)So, this is the Maw of Tartas. If the geologists
I went to school with heard that I was here,
they'd be extremely jealous.\c"
Mf4040005,"\h(«Ilchymis»)This place is much more dangerous than all of
the scientists have theorized. There is a great
deal of energy brewing down here…\c"
Mf4040006,"\h(«Ilchymis»)There are myths that speak of a Black Moon that
used to reside in the skies amongst the others.\e"
Mf4040007,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Perhaps that Black Moon might be responsible for
the immense power and pressure down here…\c"
Mff030000,"\h(«Drachma»)I can't just sit around and let Valua destroy 
everythin'! I want to help you fight 'em! We've 
come this far, haven't we?\c"
Mff030001,"\h(«Drachma»)You are sayin' that we're goin' into that 
continent? Boy, sometimes I wonder if yer head 
is a few Moon Stones short.\e"
Mff030002,"\h(«Drachma»)But, if you insist on me goin' with you, I will.\e"
Mff030003,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Yes, it would be great if you came with us.”
“It's best if you stay here for now.”\e"
Mff030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Yes, it would be great if you came with us. 
We could use that big ol' arm of yours to crack 
some skulls.\e"
Mff030005,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumph… I guess I'll go with you, boy. I… I
never though I'd be fightin' with you again…\c"
Mff030006,\h( )Drachma has joined your party.\c
Mff030007,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumph! That's fine with me, boy. But, let me
know if you change your mind…\c"
Mff050000,"\h(«Gilder»)So, now we're going to try and pass through the 
Dark Rift? Vyse, you really know how to party! 
There's never a dull moment on your ship.\c"
Mff050001,"\h(«Gilder»)I remember hearing about the fissures under 
Valua, but I never thought I'd see them.\c"
Mff050002,"\h(«Gilder»)The idea of exploring Deep Sky sounds more 
appealing than a tavern full of Nasr women.\c"
Mff050003,"\h(«Gilder»)Well, I guess this is it. The outcome of this
battle determines whether we're remembered as
martyrs or heroes. I'd rather be a hero.\c"
Mff050004,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey, Vyse.
You're not thinking of leaving me behind are 
you? I can't let you have all the fun!\e"
Mff050005,"\h(«What do you want do?»)“C'mon Gilder, let's go!”
“Sorry, but I need you to stay here.”\e"
Mff050006,"\h(«Vyse»)C'mon Gilder, let's go!\e"
Mff050007,"\h(«Gilder»)That's what I want to hear!
Let's go show them what we're made of!\c"
Mff050008,\h( )Gilder has joined the party.\c
Mff050009,"\h(«Gilder»)You're breakin' my heart! Alright, I'll stay. 
Let me know if you need me. Oh, and if Clara 
asks, you don't know where I am.\c"
Mii010000,"\h(«Aika»)This place is great! It's even got a kitchen! 
I think I'm gonna like it here.\c"
Mi1000000,"\h(«Polly»)Considering that it's inside of a ship, this 
kitchen is really impressive.\e"
Mi1000001,"\h(«Polly»)There's enough supplies and cookware here for me
to do my best work.\c"
Mi6310000,"\h(«Osman»)I like this ship a lot, it's strong and 
beautiful… much like myself.\c"
Mi6310001,"\h(«Osman»)If my shop hadn't been burned down, I would've
lent you 100,000 gold…\e"
Mi6310002,"\h(«Osman»)20% of 100,000 gold… Hm… That would've been
quite a profit.\c"
M14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)I didn't think I would live to see blue skies
ever again… I had almost forgotten how blue the
skies really were.\e"
M14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)I left Polly and Anne behind to chase my
dreams…\e"
M14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)To be stranded in such a horrible place… to
lose my memory… I am sure that the Moons were
punishing me for neglecting my family.\c"
M14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)I can't believe that I forgot about Polly when I
had anmnesia.\e"
M14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)But deep down inside, I felt an emptiness in my
heart. The one thing that filled it, was gone.\c"
M14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)When I was on Sailors' Island, Polly was the
only thing that kept me ashore. She was the best
thing that ever happened to me.\e"
M14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)And now that my memories have returned to me, I
will never neglect her again. I'd rather die. I
now know just how important Polly is to me…\c"
M14040007,"\h(«Robinson»)A ship capable of going into Deep Sky, huh?
It reminds me of the days when I challenged the
Dark Rift…\c"
M14040008,"\h(«Robinson»)I want the Valuan Admiral who attacked Crescent
Island to pay! Polly could have been killed in
the attack!\e"
M14040009,\h(«Robinson»)I cannot afford to lose Polly again…\c
M14040010,"\h(«Robinson»)Everything that is important to me is from 
Mid Ocean. Polly, Anne, my shop… \e"
M14040011,"\h(«Robinson»)That island appeared right in the middle of it. 
We've got to destroy it!\c"
M14040012,"\h(«Robinson»)I cannot say that I am strong enough to save the
world. I'm not pretending to be a hero either.\e"
M14040013,"\h(«Robinson»)But, I will fight to the death to protect Polly
and Anne… and to protect the world that they
live in…\c"
