ML0130000,"\h(«Fina»)That looks like the bridge… 
Galcian must be in there.\e"
ML0130001,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, I guess we'll just have to break that door
down, won't we?\e"
ML0130002,\h( )That will not be necessary.\e
ML0130003,\h(«Aika»)Galcian!\e
ML0130004,"\h(«Galcian»)I did not realize that there were still this
many people foolish enough to resist me.\e"
ML0130005,"\h(«Galcian»)And you, Vyse, have caused me 
more trouble than anyone.\e"
ML0130006,"\h(«Vyse»)Thanks. It's an Air Pirate's duty

ML0130007,"\h(«Vyse»)But there's one more thing I'd like to 
accomplish… \e"
ML0130008,\h(«Vyse»)I want to rid the world of you.\e
ML0130009,"\h(«Galcian»)Heh heh… 
Very amusing… but this world shall be mine! 
It's a pity you won't be around to see it.\e"
ML0130010,"\h(«Galcian»)Now, you shall feel my wrath!\e"
ML0140000,"\h(«Galcian»)How… could… this be?!
I… I will not… be… defeated… \e"
ML0140001,\h(«Vyse»)Your reign of terror is over!\e
ML0140002,\h(«Galcian»)I don't think so… \e
ML0140003,"\h(«Galcian»)You may have won the battle, but I shall have my
revenge!\e"
ML0140004,"\h(«Aika»)What?!
The bridge!\e"
ML0140005,"\h(«Galcian»)Fools, when will you realize that you cannot 
stop me!\e"
ML0140006,\h(«Galcian»)Now I shall destroy every last one of you.\e
ML0140007,"\h(«Vyse»)I thought he was too arrogant to have an escape 
pod!\e"
ML0140008,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, he's getting away! We have to do 
something!\e"
ML0140009,"\h(«Fina»)If he gets away, he'll retreat back to Soltis 
and we'll never get a chance to stop him!\e"
ML0140010,"\h(«Vyse»)The other pirates are tied up fighting with the
Armada!\e"

No… you don't think…?!\e"
ML0140015,\h(«Ramirez»)Lord Galcian!\e
ML0140016,"\h(«Galcian»)Belleza!
You… survived the attack on Valua?\e"
ML0140017,"\h(«Belleza»)Lord Galcian, so many innocent people died by 
your hand. Women and children… bled to death in
the streets… \e"
ML0140018,"\h(«Belleza»)As an Admiral in the Armada, I feel that I am
responsible for their deaths… as much as you 
are.\e"
ML0140019,"\h(«Galcian»)What… what are you doing?!
I command you to stop!!!\e"
ML0140020,"\h(«Belleza»)Good-bye, my love.\e"
ML0140021,"\h(«Vyse»)She… she sacrificed her own life to stop 
Galcian… \e"
