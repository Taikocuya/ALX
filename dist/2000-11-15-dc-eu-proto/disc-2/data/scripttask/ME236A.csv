M90090000,"\h(«Gordo»)Oh, hey! It's you, Vyse!
Don't you remember me?
It's me! Gordo, the Black Pirate!\e"
M90090001,"\h(«Gordo»)I had a change of heart and I decided to open
this restaurant here in North Ocean!\e"
M90090002,"\h(«Gordo»)It's a nice place, don't you think? I have taken
flavors from the four corners of the world and
made a new style of cooking! Hahaha!\e"
M90090003,"\h(«Gordo»)Welcome, Vyse! Come!
You must eat until your belt bursts!
Try my new Sky Sardine Skewers!\e"
M90090004,"\h(«Gordo»)Besides, you are much too skinny to be a 
captain! A man is not judged by his looks, but 
by the girth of his belly! Hahaha!\e"
M90090005,"\h(«Gordo»)What was that?
Gentum, Khale, and Kabal you say?\e"
M90090006,"\h(«Gordo»)I see… it appears that you are searching for
exquisite ingredients.\e"
M90090007,"\h(«Gordo»)Fortunately, we use Kabal here in my restaurant.
I would be very glad to give you some.\e"
M90090008,"\h(«Gordo»)It's always best to marinate it for a day or two
before cooking it… that's when it tastes best.
Good Kabal is very hard to come by…\e"
M90090009,\h( )You received “Kabal.”\e
M90090010,"\h(«Gordo»)Well then…
About those other 2 ingredients…\e"
M90090011,"\h(«Gordo»)Hmm… Gentum can easily be found in Maramba. It 
is easily recognizable for its scent.\e"
M90090012,"\h(«Gordo»)Perhaps you should go to the very center of 
trade itself, Nasrad? I'm sure you'd be able to 
find something there…\e"
M90090013,"\h(«Gordo»)And what else were you looking for? Ah yes…
Khale. The “Spice of Dreams” as it is 
sometimes called.\e"
M90090014,"\h(«Gordo»)Not only does it cover the stench of old meat, 
it adds such a wonderfully indescribable taste 
to it as well.\e"
M90090015,"\h(«Gordo»)But, alas, I have heard rumors that Khale trees
have not been seen for quite some time and are
thought to no longer exist.\e"
M90090016,"\h(«Gordo»)In the eastern world, there is an island where 
they say spice trees grow. Maybe you should 
start your search there?\e"
M90090017,"\h(«Gordo»)For “Gentum,” I think you'll be able to 
find some at Nasrad.\e"
M90090018,"\h(«Gordo»)For “Khale,” you can look in the east, on an 
island called Spice Island.\e"
M90090019,"\h(«Gordo»)Well, well… I see that the information that I 
gave you on the Gentum and Khale proved to be 
useful.\e"
M90090020,"\h(«Gordo»)Well, if you ever have any more questions 
concerning exotic ingredients, ask none other 
than Gordo, the Gourmet Pirate!\e"
M90310000,"\h(«Head Waiter»)Welcome to the Gordo's Bistro. I am
Philip, the head waiter…\e"
M90310001,"\h(«Philip»)I will help you pick a loqua to match whatever
taste you seek.\e"
M90310002,"\h(«Philip»)Lately, a new loqua has become extremely
popular. It is called “New World Loqua” and it
is from Ixa'taka.\c"
M90310003,"\h(«Philip»)Now, if you'll excuse me… I hope you enjoy your
meal.\c"
M90310004,"\h(«Philip»)I'm very sorry.
Gordo, the owner, is currently out on business.\e"
M90310005,"\h(«Philip»)I believe he has taken his ship, the Bloodlust,
and is sailing somewhere…\c"
M90320000,\h(«Waitress»)Welcome to the Gordo's Bistro.\e
M90320001,"\h(«Waitress»)Would you like to try our famous full-course
dinner? It is a very good deal at 4,000 gold
per person.\e"
M90320002,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Sounds good! We'll each have one.”
“I'm not that hungry right now, thanks.”\e"
M90320003,"\h(«Waitress»)Well, it appears that you don't have enough
money. All of our food is made with the best
ingredients, so it's rather expensive.\e"
M90320004,"\h(«Waitress»)Please… come back when you have a little more
money.\c"
M90320005,"\h(«Waitress»)Very well! Four full course dinners coming right
up! Now, here you are… enjoy your meal.\e"
M90320006,"\h(«Waitress»)Is everything fine?
That's great. Please visit us again sometime…\c"
M90320007,"\h(«Waitress»)I'm sorry to hear that…
Very well, perhaps you will visit us again
sometime.\c"
M90330000,"\h(«Guest»)Not only does this place serve gourmet food,
they serve you lots of it!\e"
M90330001,"\h(«Guest»)And I heard that the owner used to be an Air
Pirate, too!
This place is great!\c"
M90340000,"\h(«Guest»)Such a mellow fragrance…
And it's so blue that it is almost as if they
melted a Moon Stone…\e"
M90340001,"\h(«Guest»)Air Pirates may think all loqua is the same, but
in my opinion, New World Loqua is the best.\c"
M90340002,"\h(«Guest»)You should hurry up and grow up so that you may
experience all the pleasures of the world!
Ahahahaha!!!\e"
M14050000,"\h(«Domingo»)Wait a minute…
You… are you the guy that everyone's talking
about? Are you Vyse?\e"
M14050001,"\h(«Domingo»)W, wait a minute… are you Vyse?
You're a legend among sailors across the skies!\e"
M14050002,"\h(«Domingo»)You know of me, right?
I'm the traveling treasure hunter, Domingo.\e"
M14050003,"\h(«Domingo»)I travel the world looking for new Discoveries…
It's quite a relaxing job if you ask me…\e"
M14050004,"\h(«Domingo, huh?»)“Will you join us?”
“I wish you luck in your quest!”\e"
M14050005,"\h(«Vyse»)If it is okay with you, I would like you to join
my crew. Let us work together and find all the
Discoveries in the world…\e"
M14050006,"\h(«Domingo»)Heh… sorry, but the only people that I team up 
with are beautiful women, or men who are better 
treasure hunters than myself.\e"
M14050007,"\h(«Domingo»)Well, if you can find at least 30 Discoveries,
I'll admit that you're better. But, I doubt that
there's anyone who could actually do that…\e"
M14050008,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… I wouldn't talk so fast.
I've already found more than 30 Discoveries.\e"
M14050009,"\h(«Domingo»)R, really?!
I don't believe it… you actually found more
than 30 Discoveries…\e"
M14050010,"\h(«Domingo»)You are truly a treasure hunter, Vyse.
Like I promised, I'll join you in your quest.\e"
M14050011,"\h(«Domingo»)And besides, you've got two very beautiful women
with you… How can I resist?\e"
M14050012,\h( )Domingo has joined your crew as a “Lookout.”\c
M14050013,"\h(«Vyse»)If it is okay with you, I would like you to join
my crew. Let us work together and find all the
Discoveries in the world…\e"
M14050014,"\h(«Domingo»)Heh… sorry, but the only people that I team up 
with are beautiful women, or men who are better 
treasure hunters than myself.\e"
M14050015,"\h(«Domingo»)Well, if you can find at least 30 Discoveries,
I'll admit that you're better. But, I doubt that
there's anyone who could actually do that…\c"
M14050016,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, it looks like we're rivals in the search
for Discoveries, but I wish you luck!\e"
M14050017,"\h(«Domingo»)Heh, rivals, huh? Very well then, I wish you 
luck as well… but I warn you. I'm the best 
treasure hunter there is!\e"
M14050018,"\h(«Domingo»)Oh, hey Vyse! How is everything?
I hope your search for Discoveries has been as
fruitful as mine!\e"
Ms236a000,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh…
Lined up next to Gordo, it's hard to tell them
apart…\c"
Ms236a001,"\h(«Vyse»)Mmm… This sure does smell good. I can almost
taste it. I can't believe Gordo and his gang 
can actually cook this well.\c"
Ms236a002,"\h(«Vyse»)I don't recognize the name, but it looks like 
an expensive brand of loqua.\c"
Ms236a003,"\h(«Vyse»)I've never seen this fruit before. It smells
really sour, though. Heh… leave it up to Gordo
to find the rarest foods from across the world.\c"
Ms236a004,"\h(«Vyse»)This must be cheese. Oh, wow… it smells really
bad! I wonder if it's supposed to smell like
this…\c"
Ms236a005,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow… it looks like they just roasted the whole
head of this thing. That's quite a dish. I'd
like to try that some day.\c"
Ms236a006,"\h(«Vyse»)Hm… This must be some sort of sauce that Gordo
uses in his cooking. Let me have a taste… Wow!
This is really good!\c"
Ms236a007,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
