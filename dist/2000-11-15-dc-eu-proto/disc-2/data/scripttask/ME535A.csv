MA5350000,"\h(«Fina»)Yeligar… Ancient records say its thunder tore
open the skies themselves, and its roar
shook the ground.\e"
MA5350001,"\h(«Aika»)Whoa…
It doesn't sound like a very friendly Gigas…
Vyse, we should be extra careful!!\c"
MA5350002,"\h(«Aika»)It looks kinda flat… Maybe we should try
attacking from above or below!
It might be easier to hit that way.\e"
MA5350003,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Try attacking it from above.”
“Try attacking it from below.”\e"
MA5350004,"\h(«Vyse»)Let's try attacking it from above!
Increasing altitude…\c"
MA5350005,"\h(«Vyse»)Let's try attacking it from underneath…
Maybe it's underside is softer than
the rest of it…\c"
MA5350006,"\h(«Vyse»)Damn…
Not a single weakpoint…\e"
MA5350007,"\h(«Aika»)Um… More importantly… is it just me or does
that thing look a little more… active? Is the
seal weakening on it or something?\e"
MA5350008,"\h(«Enrique»)Perhaps… But whatever the reason, it appears
to be building up for some sort of attack.\e"
MA5350009,"\h(«Aika»)I wish there was some way we could knock it off
balance like we've done with all the other
Gigas, but it's just too big!\e"
MA5350010,"\h(«Aika»)Anything short of the Moon Stone Cannon probably
won't even make that thing budge!\c"
MA5350011,"\h(«Aika»)Alright!
That did it! It's off balance!\e"
MA5350012,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha! Leave it to the Moon Stone Cannon!
Alright, everyone… now's our chance!
Open fire!!!\c"
MA5350013,"\h(«Aika»)A direct hit with the Moon Stone Cannon!
The Yeligar is off balance again!\c"
MA5350014,\h(«Enrique»)Th… that attack! Its power is unbelievable…\e
MA5350015,"\h(«Fina»)Be careful, everyone! Yeligar looks ready to
attack again! It's not going to let up…\e"
MA5350016,"\h(«Aika»)Great… We didn't knock it off balance and now
we're stuck in its attack pattern. Alright,
everyone… brace for impact…\c"
MA5350017,"\h(«Aika»)Oh great! We couldn't fire the Moon Stone
Cannon in time to knock it off balance and now
Yeligar's going to attack! Here it comes…\c"
MA5350018,\h(«Aika»)Vyse… what now? Orders please!\e
