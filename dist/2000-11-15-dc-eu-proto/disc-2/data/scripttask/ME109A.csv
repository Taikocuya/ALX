MD0060000,"\h(«Aika»)This is the Temple of Pyrynn?!!
It's HUGE! I can't believe it! It's the most
amazing thing I've ever seen!\e"
MD0060001,"\h(«Vyse»)The people of the Old World were able to build
this thing in this heat!? And it's built on
sand, too!!! It's incredible!\e"
MD0060002,"\h(«Fina»)Deep within this temple lies the Red Crystal.
Be careful, though… According to Silvite lore,
it is guarded by hordes of creatures.\e"
MD0060003,"\h(«Aika»)Well then, let's get going!
Oh, Bellena? What are you going to do?\e"
MD0060004,"\h(«Bellena»)I'll be waiting out here.
And besides… I won't be able to help you fight
off monsters in this outfit.\e"
MD0060005,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, it might be a little rough in there for a
beautiful woman, like yourself…\e"
MD0060006,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, really… what about me and Fina?!
We're women, too, you know! Just what are you
trying to say?\e"
MD0060007,"\h(«Aika»)Come on, Fina.
Let's leave macho man behind and get the Crystal
ourselves.\e"
MD0060008,"\h(«Fina»)Hehehe…
That might be kind of fun. 
We'd probably get it faster without him.\e"
MD0060009,"\h(«Vyse»)H… hey! Wait a minute!
I didn't mean… \e"
MD0060010,"\h(«Bellena»)Hehehe… watching the three of you really cheers
me up. You're all such good friends and Vyse is
so funny.\e"
MD0060011,"\h(«Aika»)Well… I'm sure a beautiful woman like yourself
has got herself a much, Much, MUCH better guy
than… Mr. Foot In His Mouth…\e"
MD0060012,"\h(«Bellena»)Hahaha!
Sorry… there's no one special in my life
right now…\e"
MD0060013,"\h(«Bellena»)Well, there is someone that I'm in love with…
But he would never even give me a second look…\e"
MD0060014,"\h(«Bellena»)But I don't want to talk about it right now.
You should probably get going.
I'll be waiting here. Be careful in there, okay?\e"
MD0060015,"\h(«Vyse»)Don't worry.
We'll be back before you even notice that we
were gone.\e"
MD0080000,"\h(«Vyse»)Bellena, sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
I hope you weren't too worried about us.\e"
MD0080001,"\h(«Bellena»)I'm so glad you're alright.
Did you find the Moon Crystal?\e"
MD0080002,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh, of course we found it! \e"
MD0080003,"\h(«Bellena»)I knew you could do it!
Um, would it be alright if I took a look at it?\e"
MD0080004,"\h(«Bellena»)Wow…
So this is one of the legendary Moon Crystals…
It's more beautiful than I ever imagined.\e"
MD0080005,"\h(«Bellena»)Thank you, so much.
I'm sure that Lord Galcian will be very pleased.\e"
MD0080006,"\h(«Vyse»)What?!?!
What are you talking about!?!?!\e"
MD0080007,\h(«Bellena»)Hahaha… Let me show you.\e
MD0080008,"\h(«Vyse»)Bellena…
Who are you?!\e"
MD0080009,"\h(«Belleza»)Let me reintroduce myself. I am Belleza.
The Fourth Admiral of the Imperial Armada!\e"
MD0080010,"\h(«Belleza»)I specialize in covert operations. You don't
need to get your hands bloody to win battles.
Sometimes a little trickery goes a long way.\e"
MD0080011,\h(«Vyse»)You!!! You tricked us!!!\e
MD0080012,\h(«Fina»)Bellena…?\e
MD0080013,\h(«Fina»)Or… umm… Belleza…\e
MD0080014,"\h(«Fina»)So everything that you said…
about your parents…
about war… about your childhood…\e"
MD0080015,"\h(«Fina»)Was it all a lie? 
Did you just say that to get us to trust you?\e"
MD0080016,"\h(«Belleza»)I told you the truth. I never said my father was
from Nasr. He was a Valuan soldier and he did
die in battle.\e"
MD0080017,"\h(«Belleza»)Years later, I too, became a soldier…
I want to put an end to all wars so nobody
has to go through what I went through.\e"
MD0080018,"\h(«Belleza»)Countries go to war arguing over borders and
resources. If the world was united under one
rule, there would be no more war.\e"
MD0080019,"\h(«Belleza»)That is why we need the power of the Gigas to
make sure no one opposes us! Valua must rule
the world.\e"
MD0080020,"\h(«Fina»)Belleza!!! NO, DON'T!!!\e"
MD0080021,"\h(«Belleza»)Red Gigas, Recumen! As bearer of the Red Moon
Crystal, I command you to awaken and do my
bidding!\e"
MD0080022,"\h(«Vyse»)Umm… Fina? 
What did she do? 
This is bad, right?\e"
MD0080023,"\h(«Fina»)Recumen…
No… She can't be…\e"
MD0080024,"\h(«Belleza»)Goodbye, handsome…\e"
MD0080025,"\h(«Belleza»)Recumen, I command you! 
Engulf these three in your flames.\e"
MD0080026,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse!
Aika!
Hurry! We must run!\e"
MD0080027,\h(«Vyse»)Fina! What's going on?\e
MD0080028,"\h(«Fina»)Belleza… she… she is summoning Recumen,
the Red Gigas!!!\e"
MD0080029,"\h(«Fina»)She's using the power of the Red Moon Crystal to
awaken him!!!\e"
MD0080030,"\h(«Vyse»)… She what!?
I guess we are going to have to run!
Aika, Fina… let's get out of here!\e"
MD0090000,\h(«Vyse»)Is that…?!\e
MD0090001,"\h(«Fina»)Yes, that is the Red Gigas, Recumen.\e"
MD0090002,"\h(«Aika»)So those weren't statues in front of the Temple,
they were its heads!\e"
MD0090003,"\h(«Vyse»)It's looking at us…
RUN!!!\e"
MD0090004,\h(«Fina»)Aahh!\e
MD0090005,\h(«Vyse»)Fina!\e
MD0090006,"\h(«Aika»)Fina, are you alright?
C'mon, we gotta go!\e"
MD0090007,"\h(«Fina»)I'm sorry…
I tripped…\e"
MD0090008,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika, Fina! Take cover!\e"
MD0090009,\h(«Vyse»)…It missed us… something hit it in the head!!!\e
MD0090010,"\h(«Drachma»)I can't leave you three alone, can I?
Stop gawkin' and get on!\e"
MD0090011,\h(«Vyse»)Captain!\e
MD0090012,"\h(«Aika»)Cap'n!
You came back for us!\e"
MD0090013,"\h(«Vyse»)Hurry, maybe we can take that thing out in the
Little Jack.\e"
M00003000,"\h(ベレナ)「何かピュラミス神殿のザコ戦に
　ついてヒントメッセージを
　言う予定よ。ウフフフ……」\c"
M01090000,"\h(«Bellena»)Nasr basks in the light of the Red Moon. Most
of the creatures that live here have a strong
connection with it.\e"
M01090001,"\h(«Bellena»)Try using a Purple Moon Stone on your weapons.
You'll see that you can inflict much more damage
on them that way.\c"
M01090002,"\h(«Vyse»)… Hm. It won't budge.
Maybe there's a special way to open it.\c"
M01090003,"\h(«Vyse»)I can't get this door to budge at all.
It's too heavy to even move.\c"
M01090004,"\h(«Vyse»)… What's this? There looks like there's some
sort of switch on top of this pedestal.\c"
M01090005,"\h(«Vyse»)Whoa… It looks like the switch opens water
channels to this area.\c"
M01090006,"\h(«Vyse»)The magma has already been hardened so there's
no need to run any more water.\c"
M01090007,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like some sort of door.
Hm… I can't get it to budge, though.\c"
M01090008,"\h(«Vyse»)This is the pedestal where the Red Moon Crystal
was. It looks really old… but it's still in
perfect shape.\c"
M01090009,"\h(«Vyse»)I wonder what this pedestal is for…
It's got a strange indentation
on the surface…\c"
M01090010,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to your ship.”
“Stay in here a little while longer.”\c"
M01090011,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to the Little Jack.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
M01090012,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
