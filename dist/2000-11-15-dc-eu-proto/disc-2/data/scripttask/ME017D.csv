Ms017d000,"\h(«Vyse»)Vases, lamps… She's got expensive things from
all over the place. I really don't know where
she gets this stuff…\e"
Ms017d009,"\h(«Vyse»)But, this stuff isn't for sale. It's all Osman's
personal stuff. I guess she just likes showing
it off…\c"
Ms017d001,"\h(«Vyse»)Small animals preserved in jars…
There's all kinds of creepy stuff here.
Fina would probably faint if she saw this.\c"
Ms017d002,"\h(«Vyse»)I wonder what this pink liquid is for?
I sure hope it's not medicine…\c"
Ms017d003,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…
I don't know what language this is written in.
I can't read a single word of it.\c"
Ms017d004,"\h(«Vyse»)There's all kinds of chemicals here.
Ilchymis must really know his stuff
to be able to use all of these.\c"
Ms017d005,"\h(«Vyse»)Fish, plants…
What the…?! An eyeball?!\c"
Ms017d006,"\h(«Vyse»)Ryu-kan said that this was a suit of armor
worn by a Yafutoman admiral long ago.
The horns on the helmet look menacing.\c"
Ms017d007,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… there's string wrapped around the grip.
That must prevent slipping by making it easier
to hold on to.\c"
Ms017d008,"\h(«Vyse»)So this is Ryu-kan's hearth.
This is where he works his craft. I've never
seen a more skilled swordsmith in my life.\c"
Ms017d010,"\h(«Vyse»)Ropes are all-important for voyages.
Even the Delphinus uses rope for a lot
of various things.\c"
Ms017d011,"\h(«Vyse»)It's full of materials and tools.
They're important for quick repairs
during voyages.\c"
Ms017d012,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a large stash of
food and other supplies
for long voyages.\c"
Ms017d013,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika said this box “contains things essential
to the survival of women while travelling.”
What exactly is in this thing, anyway?\c"
Ms017d014,"\h(«Vyse»)We use Moon Stones for just about everything…
They're especially important for long voyages.
So, it's always good to have a little extra.\c"
Ms017d015,"\h(«Vyse»)It's ammunition for the Delphinus.
The cannonballs so big that there wasn't
enough space at the harbor, I guess.\c"
Ms017d016,"\h(«Vyse»)Loqua never lasted very long back on Pirate
Isle, but my new crew doesn't drink it up
quite as fast.\c"
Ms017d017,"\h(«Vyse»)It's full of preserved food. These
are emergency rations, so I probably
shouldn't eat any of it…\c"
Ms017d018,"\h(«Vyse»)We use Moon Stones for just about everything…
They're especially important for long voyages.
So, it's always good to have a little extra.\c"
Ms017d019,"\h(«Vyse»)It's some clothes and other everyday supplies.
Some of it's bought, some of it's stolen…\c"
Ms017d020,"\h(«Vyse»)It's Izmael's toolbox. If anyone touches it, he
starts yelling and swinging his hammer around at
everyone. It's actually pretty funny to watch.\c"
Ms017d021,"\h(«Vyse»)Ladders come in handy during voyages.
You can also use them to board
enemy ships in a fight.\c"
Ms017d022,"\h(«Vyse»)Huh? What is this supposed to be?
A backdrop?\c"
Ms017d023,"\h(«Vyse»)Is this cloth from Yafutoma?
I swear… all Osman ever does is show off her
stuff. She never actually sells it…\c"
Ms017d024,"\h(«Vyse»)This is Nasr pottery.
It's probably from her shop
back in Nasrad.\e"
Ms017d025,"\h(«Vyse»)It's pretty impressive how much stuff
she was able to save during the Valuan
attack on Nasrad.\c"
Ms017d026,"\h(«Vyse»)It's the same kind of sword that the
Yafutoman soldiers were using. Yafutoman
swords have such interesting shapes.\c"
Ms017d027,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a blade used by Yafutoman
swordsmen. It's got an intricate
design etched into the handguard.\c"
Ms017d028,"\h(«Vyse»)Is this a Valuan book? Hmm… Nope, I can't
understand any of this. Well, to be honest,
I didn't think I actually would, anway.\c"
Ms017d029,"\h(«Vyse»)“Medical Encyclopedia,” “Anatomy,”
“The Moon and Alchemy…”
These are too complicated for me.\c"
Ms017d030,"\h(«Vyse»)These are Ilchymis' notebooks.
Ugh, they're full of mathematical formulas
and long words I can't even pronounce.\c"
Ms017d031,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a strange-colored liquid.
I wonder if he's going to use
this to make medicine?\c"
Ms017d032,"\h(«Vyse»)I guess he's brought some books from his
island that he hasn't even opened yet.
How much stuff did he bring, anyway?\c"
M06310014,"\h(«Osman»)Damn Valuans! 
They already burned down my shop once!\e"
M06310015,"\h(«Osman»)How long are you going to let the Armada run 
around blowing things up? Stop wasting time
talking to me and go after them!\c"
M06310000,"\h(«Osman»)Greetings! I have a plethora of items 
for you and your crew.\e"
M06310001,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to Osman.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06310002,\h(«Osman»)This shop is a little dull for my taste!\e
M06310003,"\h(«Osman»)I want a bigger shop! A shop that is more
befitting of a merchant as grand as myself!
I'll need 2,000 gold to remodel this place!\e"
M06310004,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Give Osman the 2,000 gold to remodel.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M06310005,"\h( )You gave 2,000 gold to Osman.\e"
M06310006,"\h(«Osman»)Thank you Captain, you've got great taste!
I'll use my looks to try and scare up 
a few new items.\c"
M06310007,"\h(«Osman»)Wait, you don't have enough money! You don't
even have 2,000 gold?! I thought you were
the captain around here! Go get some more gold!\e"
M06310008,"\h(«Osman»)Captain, you're awfully stingy. 
I guess that explains your outfit.\e"
M06310009,"\h(«Osman»)Please come again! And be sure to bring
plenty of gold with you, too!\c"
M06310010,"\h(«Osman»)I'll build you a shop worthy of this island 
base. Our base IS quite impressive, you know.\c"
M06310011,"\h(«Osman»)Please, take a look around. 
I've got items galore!\e"
M06310012,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to Osman.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06310016,"\h(«Osman»)I'm sorry, Captain, but you're not my type.\e"
M06310017,"\h(«Osman»)I would prefer not to speak to one as…
cowardly… as yourself.\c"
M06310018,"\h(«Osman»)Well, Captain… you want to speak with me? 
I guess I haven't lost my girlish charm…\e"
M06310019,"\h(«Osman»)But I'm terribly sorry… You're not quite up to
my standards for men. I like my men a little…
more courageous.\c"
M06310020,"\h(«Osman»)Well, well, well… You may be young, but you've
become quite a man of the world. I simply cannot
wait until you're a little more… mature.\e"
M06310021,"\h(«Osman»)But don't worry… come back and see me 
later. I'll make a real man out of you.\c"
M06310022,"\h(«Osman»)Let me tell you, Captain… I feel so lucky to be
part of your crew. There aren't quite as many
men like you in the world anymore…\e"
M06310023,"\h(«Osman»)But just give me the sign… and I'll show you
just how womanly I can be… heh heh…\c"
M06310013,"\h(«Osman»)Please come again! And be sure to bring
plenty of gold with you, too!\c"
M14030029,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)What? There's nothing going on here. 
Perhaps you would be more useful
somewhere else.\c"
M14030001,"\h(«What are you going to do?»)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk to Ryu-kan.”
“Leave.”\e"
M14030000,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)I've got a collection of some of the 
finest weapons that you'll ever see.\e"
M14030100,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Captain, I am a little tired right now. 
My… youth is escaping me.\e"
M14030101,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)If you return later, when my strength returns, 
I shall forge you a blade worthy of legends.\c"
M14030002,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)I cannot work in this paltry environment! 
How can you expect me to forge legendary
weapons in these conditions?!\e"
M14030003,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)I require more sophisticated tools! All of the 
modifications that I need to make this area
adequate will cost 4,000 gold.\e"
M14030004,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Give 4,000 gold to Ryu-kan.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M14030005,"\h( )You gave 4,000 gold to Ryu-kan.\e"
M14030006,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)It's good to know that you appreciate quality.
I'll have my shop remodeled by the time 
you return to the island.\c"
M14030007,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)It will require more gold than you have. 
Come back again when you have enough and we'll
talk.\e"
M14030008,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)It's a pity…
A good blade can save your life.\e"
M14030009,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)A warrior who neglects his weapons is living on
borrowed time.\c"
M14030010,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)The modifications will be complete by the time
you return to the island.\c"
M14030011,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Now that I have an adequate forge, I can make
weapons befitting of your crew. Would you like
to purchase something from me?\e"
M14030012,"\h(«What are you going to do?»)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk to Ryu-kan.”
“Leave.”\e"
M14030013,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Vyse, have you ever heard of “Velorium?”
It's rumored to be lighter than a feather, and
harder than a diamond.\e"
M14030014,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Velorium, even in the hands of a mediocre
swordsmith, would produce superior weapons.\e"
M14030015,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)If you are able to acquire some “Velorium,”
and bring it to me, I will be able to craft
weapons of legendary quality.\c"
M14030016,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Find me some “Velorium”, and I shall 
craft a blade worthy of legends.\c"
M14030030,\h(«Ryu-kan»)You have “Velorium?!”\e
M14030031,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)I am sorry… there isn't enough to forge a 
blade. If you could find some more, I will 
be able to craft a blade for you.\c"
M14030017,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)A great weapon is only as good as 
the warrior who wields it… unless
the weapon was created by me.\c"
M14030018,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)You have “Velorium!”
You are worthy of my finest blade!\e"
M14030019,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)I shall begin forging your blade at once!
This will be my greatest creation!
May it serve you well.\c"
M14030020,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Genius should never be rushed.
Please come back later.\c"
M14030021,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Vyse, I have finished forging the
finest blade I have ever crafted. I
present to you, the Vorlik Blade.\e"
M14030022,\h( )You received the “Vorlik Blade.”\e
M14030023,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Since this blade was crafted solely for you, 
I customized the guard and the pommel to fit
your hand.\c"
M14030024,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)This is the finest blade that I have ever
created. May it serve you well.\c"
M14030025,\h(«Ryu-kan»)Are you looking for weapons?\e
M14030026,"\h(«What are you going to do?»)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk to Ryu-kan.”
“Leave.”\e"
M14030027,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)I hope that you are putting the Vorlik Blade
to good use. It has no equal in this world…\c"
M14030028,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)A great weapon in the hands of a novice, 
will eventually find the hands of an expert.\c"
M14060042,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Oh, Vyse… last night was terrible. 
Most of the base was destroyed.\e"
M14060043,"\h(«Ilchymis»)We were fortunate that no one 
was seriously hurt.\c"
M14060000,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Hello Vyse, can I help you?\e"
M14060001,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to Ilchymis.”
“Leave.”\e"
M14060002,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Hmm, this shop is adequate, but it's 
lacking some of the more sophisticated 
equipment.\e"
M14060003,"\h(«Ilchymis»)If I could purchase some, it would be
possible to make better medicines, but it will
cost 1,000 gold to upgrade everything.\e"
M14060004,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Give 1,000 gold to Ilchymis.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M14060005,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Really, are you sure? Thank you very much!  
I'll get started on renovating the lab, 
right away.\c"
M14060006,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Umm… I appreciate your generous offer, 
but you don't seem to have enough gold.\e"
M14060007,"\h(«Ilchymis»)If I had better equipment, I'd be able to make 
more sophisticated medicines… \e"
M14060008,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Thank you very much. 
I hope I can help you!\e"
M14060009,"\h(«Ilchymis»)I'll be finished remodeling by the time 
you return to the island.\c"
M14060049,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Oh, hello Vyse. Thanks to you, I have this
wonderful lab where I can create medicines
for you and your crew.\e"
M14060050,\h(«Vyse»)I'm glad you like it.\e
M14060051,"\h(«Vyse»)Ilchymis, I've been wanting to ask you… 
Why did you decide to devote your entire
life to medicine?\e"
M14060052,"\h(«Vyse»)Before you joined my crew, you lived on that
little island all by yourself, mixing 
ingredients, and making potions.\e"
M14060026,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Hahaha… You've been wondering why I decided to
become a hermit?\e"
M14060027,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Well, I will tell you. Perhaps you will
understand why I chose this life.\e"
M14060028,"\h(«Ilchymis»)My parents were both nobles from Upper City. 
So, during my childhood, I was well taken care
of.\e"
M14060029,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Because of my family's wealth, I was able to buy
all of the books I wanted.
I read all the time, you see.\e"
M14060030,"\h(«Ilchymis»)One day, on my way to the bookstore, I saw a 
very sick man from Lower City. He crawled into 
Upper City on his hands and knees.\e"
M14060031,"\h(«Ilchymis»)He was begging for money, so he could buy 
medicine. But no one would help him. I ran
to the shop to try and help the man…\e"
M14060032,"\h(«Ilchymis»)When I returned, he was already… dead. I felt
so helpless. From that day on, I decided that
I would devote my life to helping others.\e"
M14060033,"\h(«Ilchymis»)I spent days alone in my room reading about all
the different types of medicines and potions. In
time, I became one of Valua's best researchers.\e"
M14060034,"\h(«Ilchymis»)I wanted to make medicines that the people
in Lower City could afford. I wanted to help
people, but Valua had other plans for me.\e"
M14060035,"\h(«Ilchymis»)They wanted me to make weapons for their
military… Shortly after, I fled Valua and found
an island where I could continue my studies.\e"
M14060036,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Sorry, if my story seemed a bit long… \e"
M14060037,"\h(«Ilchymis»)I believe in you, Vyse. Although you are a 
warrior, you are fighting for the right cause.\c"
M14060038,"\h(«Ilchymis»)And that is why I want to aid you in 
your fight. I will do everything in my power 
to assist you and your crew.\e"
M14060010,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Hello Vyse, can I help you?\e"
M14060011,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to Ilchymis.”
“Leave.”\e"
M14060060,"\h(«Ilchymis»)That reminds me… I've come up with a new little
concoction that I'm rather proud of.\e"
M14060061,"\h(«Ilchymis»)It will heal your entire party and regenerate
all of your magic power at once. Heh… I've
named it the “Ilchymix.” Like the name?\e"
M14060062,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Heh… Well, it takes a few moments for it to
take effect, so it won't be of any use to you
while you are in battle.\e"
M14060063,"\h(«Ilchymis»)It's a little expensive to make, but I've gotten
the whole process… pardon the expression… down
to a science. It will cost 4,000 gold for 10.\e"
M14060064,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Ilchymix? Heh… sounds great! I'll take them.”
“Maybe some other time, Ilchymis.”\e"
M14060065,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Alright! Just remember, you won't be able to use
them during battle, so be careful, okay?\e"
M14060066,\h( )You received 10 “Ilchymixes.”\e
M14060067,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Hmm… It looks like you do not have enough gold.
It's alright, though. Just come back when you've
saved enough and I'll sell them to you.\e"
M14060069,"\h(«Ilchymis»)It looks like you're already carrying as many
as you can. Let's not get too greedy…\c"
M14060070,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Alright, just let me know when you want 
to purchase some. I've made enough 
to last a long time.\c"
M14060068,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Thank you very much.
Please come again!\c"
M14060071,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Welcome, Vyse. I just made a new batch of
Ilchymixes. It's 4,000 gold for 10 of them.\c"
M14060012,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Vyse, do you know anything about \c\c\c?"
M14060013,"\h(«Ilchymis»)When you add xxxxxx and xxxxxx to this,
I heard that you can make the ultimate medicine.\e"
M14060014,"\h(«Ilchymis»)If you can get these material, I can make you
very strong items.\e"
M14060015,\h(«Ilchymis»)Thank you very much. I hope it will help you.\e
M14060016,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Captain, if I am not mistaken, are they… so you
found all the material needed at last!\e"
M14060017,"\h(«Ilchymis»)I'll start making the medicine immediately.
You can look forward to it.\e"
M14060018,"\h(«Ilchymis»)It's going to take a little more time to finish
the ultimate medicine, so come back again later.\e"
M14060019,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Oh, Vyse, I was waiting for you! This is the
xxxxx.\e"
M14060020,\h( )You got one ultimate heeling potion xxxxx!\e
M14060021,"\h(«Ilchymis»)I figured out the components of this potion,
so I can sell it at my store too from now on.\e"
M14060022,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Hello Vyse, can I help you?\e"
M14060023,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to Ilchymis.”
“Leave.”\e"
M14060044,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Something that will completely heal you and
regenerate your magic power? Hm… It will cost
you xx gold. Is that okay?\e"
