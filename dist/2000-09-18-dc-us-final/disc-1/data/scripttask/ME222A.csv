MF0200000,\h(《Air Pirate》)Captain Gilder!\e
MF0200001,"\h(《Gilder》)Uhhh… 
Not again, Maria… 
Let me sleep a little longer…\e"
MF0200002,"\h(《Air Pirate》)… Captain!!! 
Uhh… Captain… 
You need to wake up!\e"
MF0200003,"\h(《Gilder》)… Huh?
Oh…\e"
MF0200004,"\h(《Air Pirate》)We just picked up a boy stranded on a deserted 
island. He says that he's been there for two 
weeks!\e"
MF0200005,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Judging by the way he's dressed, he's probably 
an Air Pirate. He looks like he's about 17. 
He's pretty much still a baby.\e"
MF0200006,"\h(《Willy》)Oh Baby! 
Oh Baby!\e"
MF0200007,"\h(《Gilder》)He's a lucky kid… he was only stranded for two 
weeks.\e"
MF0200008,"\h(《Gilder》)But, if it was me and I was stuck on an island 
without any women for two whole weeks… 
I'm not sure if I would have made it!!!\e"
MF0200009,"\h(《Gilder》)So, you're the guy that was stranded?\e"
MF0200010,"\h(《Gilder》)Hmm… and you're dressed like an Air Pirate.
What's your name, kid?\e"
MF0200011,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm Vyse.
Thank you for saving me.
Are you the captain of this ship?\e"
MF0200012,"\h(《Gilder》)Yes, I am.
Just call me Gilder.\e"
MF0200013,"\h(《Gilder》)The ship's name is Claudia.
And this “beast” on my shoulder here is Willy.\e"
MF0200014,"\h(《Gilder》)Come to the bridge.
I want to hear about your adventures.\e"
MF0200015,"\h(《Gilder》)Hahahahaha!!!
You've defeated three of the Armada's Admirals 
and escaped from the Grand Fortress?\e"
MF0200016,"\h(《Gilder》)I like you, Vyse.
I wouldn't expect anything less from 
an Air Pirate.\e"
MF0200017,"\h(《Gilder》)Personally, I'm constantly searching for 
adventure.\e"
MF0200018,"\h(《Gilder》)Treasure, brawls… and women. There are tons of 
things in this world that make me happy.\e"
MF0200019,"\h(《Gilder》)“Women are like sunsets… They're beautiful, but
there will be a different one tomorrow,”
that's my motto.\e"
MF0200020,"\h(《What do you say?》)“That's a good motto.”
“That's a little messed up…”\e"
MF0200021,"\h(《Vyse》)That's a good motto.
I'm sure with your looks, you get all the women.\e"
MF0200022,"\h(《Gilder》)Hahhahahaha!
Hey… I don't want another guy to tell me that!\e"
MF0200023,"\h(《Gilder》)But thanks for the compliment. 
Oh, and I do get all the women.\e"
MF0200024,"\h(《Vyse》)That's messed up!
How can you be a captain with an attitude like 
that?\e"
MF0200025,"\h(《Gilder》)Hahhahahaha!
You're right. But, strangely enough, here I am, 
commanding my own ship.\e"
MF0200026,"\h(《Gilder》)But what about yourself? Here you are battling 
Valua and chasing Rhaknam all over the world. 
You're not the type to settle down either.\e"
MF0200027,"\h(《Gilder》)So, you've been away from your ship for two 
weeks, right? I'll bet you really miss sailing.
Go ahead. Take the wheel.\e"
MF0200028,"\h(《Vyse》)Wha?!
Really? You'd let me…?\e"
MF0200029,"\h(《Gilder》)I don't care…
Anyone who's accomplished what you have knows 
his way around a ship.\e"
MF0200030,"\h(《Gilder》)The Claudia's a little on the sensitive side,
but you'll get the hang of her in no time…\e"
MF0200031,"\h(《Gilder》)I'm heading to Nasrad. It's the capital of Nasr,
due south from here.\e"
MF0200032,"\h(《Gilder》)If you get lost, just look at the map and get 
your bearings. Alright! Let's go!\e"
MF0200033,\h(　)Gilder has joined your party.\e
MF0210000,"\h(《Air Pirate》)Captain! There's a suspicious looking ship 
heading straight for us… it's coming in fast!
And it's pink!\e"
MF0210001,"\h(《Gilder》)What? 
I wonder who…
Oh, no…\e"
MF0210002,"\h(《Clara》)There you are, my love!
You can't play hard to get forever.\e"
MF0210003,\h(《Clara》)My heart belongs to you!!!\e
MF0210004,"\h(《Gilder》)Yup…
It's Clara, alright…\e"
MF0210005,"\h(《Gilder》)Hmm… in some ways, she's even more frightening 
than the Armada!\e"
MF0210006,"\h(《Gilder》)Okay, here's the plan.\e"
MF0210007,"\h(《Gilder》)Vyse, you and I are going to take a lifeboat to 
Nasrad and my crew will sail my ship in the 
opposite direction as a decoy.\e"
MF0210008,"\h(《Gilder》)Whaddaya say?
Sounds like a plan?\e"
MF0210009,"\h(《Vyse》)Umm… Okay.
But you're the captain… 
Is it alright for you to leave your ship?\e"
MF0210010,"\h(《Gilder》)Heh heh… don't worry about it.
Titles mean nothing to me.\e"
MF0210011,"\h(《Gilder》)And I told you earlier, didn't I?
I'm always searching for adventure.\e"
MF0210012,"\h(《Gilder》)Alright, everyone!
Time for Operation Clara… 
You know the routine. Catch up with us later.\e"
MF0210013,\h(《Air Pirates》)Aye aye!\e
MF0210014,\h(《Gilder》)Haha… works every time.\e
MF0210015,"\h(《Gilder》)Alright Vyse, let's head south.
Let's see what kind of fun Nasrad has to offer.\e"
MF0210016,\h(　)Gilder has joined your party.\e
