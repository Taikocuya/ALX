M06000003,"\h(《Sailor》)I came intending to replenish my supplies in
Nasrad, but the place has burned to the ground!
What a shock!\e"
M06000004,"\h(《Sailor》)There's almost nothing being sold in the shops,
and even what's available is so expensive. But I
still have to replenish my supplies somehow...\c"
M06000005,"\h(《Sailor》)Let's see, I've bought the Moon Stones I need,
so now I have to find 5 barrels of drinking
water...   \e"
M06000006,"\h(《Sailor》)The shops are finally starting to fill up again.
Looks like I can start using Nasrad as a regular
resupply point again.\c"
M06010004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Let us see... A box of tomatoes with one, two...
No, this box is not any good either.\e"
M06010005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)When only this many survive the fire, you cannot
miscount even if you want to.\c"
M06010006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Ixa'takan cypress… Let us see, we have two, 
four… \e"
M06010007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Do not talk to me now!
I am busy with the relief supplies.\c"
M06330011,"\h(《Khazim》)Arghh!!… Crap! Dammit all! They called me the 
best gunner around! I was Khazim, the crack 
shot!\e"
M06330012,"\h(《Khazim》)But I let down my guard, and before I could do 
anything to stop them, the enemy turned the 
whole city to dust. \e"
M06330013,"\h(《Khazim》)It really chaps my hide! I think I will fly 
right over to Valua and give them a blast in the
chops!\e"
M06330014,"\h(《Vyse》)Calm down, calm down. You do anything like that,
and you'll get blasted right back. It's way too
reckless.\e"
M06330015,"\h(《Aika》)Ha, ha. So says the man who was so reckless as
to escape from Valua twice over.\e"
M06330016,"\h(《Khazim》)Wh, what is that? Y, you are not… ?\e"
M06330017,"\h(《Khazim》)Could you be that pirate Vyse who abducted the
Valuan prince and blasted your way out of the
Grand Fortress?\e"
M06330018,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I don't know about the abducted part, but 
otherwise, yes, I am indeed Vyse. \e"
M06330019,"\h(《Khazim》)In that case, you've got to do this for me,
Vyse! Let me join your crew!  \e"
M06330020,"\h(《Khazim》)I will never be satisfied until I have delivered
a blow from my cannon to Valua!\e"
M06330021,"\h(《Khazim》)I must join forces with you and become your 
ship's gunner. Good! It is decided!\e"
M06330022,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, well, it doesn't sound like you'll take no
for an answer, so I suppose we might as well
have you come aboard.\e"
M06330023,\h(　)Khazim has joined your crew as a “Gunner.”\c
M06340002,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)Our job was to defend Nasrad, but we were
completely helpless to do anything.\e"
M06340003,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)It makes me damn angry, and I'd sure like to go 
beat Valua to a pulp!\c"
M06350002,\h(《Khazim's Man》)Boss Khazim is in the turret on top of the wall!\e
M06350003,"\h(《Khazim's Man》)Boss says he's going to attack Valua and get
revenge even if he has to do it all by himself.\c"
M06020100,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well, it is Vyse the Ninny, yes?. Are you sure
you can handle firing one of my cannons? They
make really loud noises, you know. HAHAHAHA!!\e"
M06020101,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey there! I have cannons for all of your
destructive needs! Take a look around!\e"
M06020102,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey there! I have cannons for all of your 
destructive needs! Take a look around!\e"
M06020103,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, you are the one they call Vyse the
Determined, yes? Buy a cannon from me. I know
you will put it to good use!\e"
M06020104,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Well, it is Vyse the Respected, is it not?
Thank you for stopping by my shop! Do you wish
to buy something while you are here?\e"
M06020105,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, it is Vyse the Admirable! I never expected
you to visit my shop!\e"
M06020106,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, it is Vyse the Bold! I never expected to
see you in here! Have you come to buy some
cannons?\e"
M06020107,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, it is Vyse! You are so lucky… people call
you “Vyse the Valiant.” I wish someone would
call me “Valiant”… \e"
M06020108,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, it is Vyse! You are so lucky… people call
you “Vyse the Daring.” I wish someone would
call me “Daring”… \e"
M06020109,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh! Hey, you are Vyse the Dashing! Please buy
something from me! That way I can brag to all of
my friends!\e"
M06020110,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Oh, it is you! Vyse the Fearless! Hey… um… is
it true? Did you really open the gates of the
Grand Fortress with your bare hands?\e"
M06020111,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)V, Vyse the Hero! You are here! Well… you must
buy something from me! It would make me feel
like a part of history!\e"
M06020112,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Hey, you are the King of Rogues! I am so glad
that you are not a Black Pirate. Otherwise, I
would probably never get any of my shipments!\e"
M06020113,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Welcome! I am deeply honored to have you in my
humble shop, Vyse!! You truly are a living
legend!\e"
M06020008,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Welcome, welcome. How goes the sailing? Perhaps
you'd like a big cannon to blow your enemies out
of the sky?\e"
M06020009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06020010,\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Those Valuans are truly merciless.\e
M06020011,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)They confiscated all my merchandise. All that I
had in this world.\e"
M06020012,"\h(《Ship Parts Merchant》)Thank you for stopping by! May the Red Moon 
watch over you.\c"
M06030100,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Are you not the one they call Vyse the Ninny?
Nice nickname. How did you earn it?\e"

visit this guild… It is a true honor, sir.\e"
M06030112,"\h(《Guildmaster》)V, Vyse the Legend?! I feel honored just to be
able to talk to one as great as yourself!
W, welcome to the Sailors' Guild!\e"
M06030113,"\h(《Guildmaster》)Wait… is that the legendary “Daccat's Coin?”
H, how did you find it?! I will pay you 20,000
gold for it!!\e"
M06030114,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell Discoveries information.”
“Sell Daccat's Coin.”

“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06030014,"\h(《Guildmaster》)I never imagined Valua could have perfected a
ship that could blast through the stone reef.\e"
M06030015,"\h(《Guildmaster》)If I had known that before, I would have left 
many moons ago. What a mistake!\e"
M06030016,"\h(《Guildmaster》)In every port of any size, you should always 
find a branch office of the Sailors' Guild. I 
suggest you pay a visit.\c"
M06230016,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Welcome, welcome! It is a terrible mess all 
around, but this inn has survived. It will be 
240 gold a night. Would you like a room?\e"
M06230017,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06230018,"\h(《Innkeeper》)Your room is at the top of the stairs.
Sleep well.\c"

Well, goodbye and good luck! Shakra!\c"
M06230021,"\h(《Innkeeper》)What is this? Hey… you do not have enough
money. I am sorry, but you will have to come
later when you have saved up a little bit more.\c"
M06230020,"\h(《Innkeeper》)You're leaving?
Well, be careful not to overexert yourself.
Come again when you're tired.\c"
M06250100,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Welcome! Wait… I have heard of you! You are

you. Have you come to see my wares?\e"

great weapons for you! Do you wish to buy
something from me?\e"
M06250107,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Valiant! I cannot believe you have 
actually come to visit my store!\e"
M06250108,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)I have heard of you… “Vyse the Daring.”
I wish I had a title like that… \e"

M06250113,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Y, you are Vyse! You are a living legend! I, I 
cannot believe that you have taken time to visit
my humble store… I am so deeply honored…\c"
M06250000,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Welcome! This is a weapons shop. I urge you to 
take responsibility for your own defense by 
arming yourself with quality weapons.\e"
M06250010,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06250011,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Most of the soldiers have been captured and
taken away. The rest have been disarmed, and all
the weapons in town have been seized.\e"
M06250012,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)Why was my merchandise spared? Well, as it is
said, with enough gold, you can buy your way out
of the Valuan Grand Fortress.\e"
M06250013,\h(《Weapons Merchant》)May the Red Moon shine upon you! Come again!\c
M06260012,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Well, well, long time no see. Judging from the
fact that you are all together, I guess you must
have patched things up.\e"
M06260013,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Excellent, excellent! All is well. 
Try not to fight from now on.\c"
M06260100,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Well, here… take this. I wish for you to have 
it. Consider it a token of my gratitude.\e"
M06260101,\h(　)You received 1 “Abirik Cham.”\e
M06260102,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I thought that a Moon Stone shard as beautiful
as that would be fitting for ladies such as
yourselves.\c"
M06260014,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)You seem so familiar... Ah, yes, I remember you!
It has been a long time!\e"
M06260015,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)It is I, the merchant you escorted to the South
Dannel Strait.\e"
M06260016,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)As you can see, Nasrad has become mere ruins.
But we merchants are not about to let that get
us down!\e"
M06260017,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)We intend to dig in and rebuild until Nasrad is
a busy and populous trade center once more.\c"
M06260103,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)Well, here… take this. I wish for you to have 
it. Consider it a token of my gratitude.\e"
M06260104,\h(　)You received 1 “Abirik Cham.”\e
M06260105,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)I thought that a Moon Stone shard as beautiful

M06260018,"\h(《Nasr Merchant》)We intend to dig in and rebuild until Nasrad is
a busy and populous trade center once more.\c"
M06270100,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Welcome to my shop. Hey, you are Vyse the Ninny,

as you are able! Hahahaha!!!\e"
M06270101,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Hey… can I help you? I am in the middle of

you for visiting my store! Please buy something!\e"
M06270107,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Welcome to my store, Vyse the Valiant. I knew

M06270111,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Ah, it is Vyse the Hero! Well, at least someone
is fighting against the Valuans! It is about 
time we had a true hero!\e"
M06270112,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Y, you are the King of Rogues, are you not?! I
have heard about all of your adventures. You
really are something… \e"
M06270113,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Welcome, Vyse the Legend. Stories of your 
exploits have reached even here. Tales of your
adventures will be told for generations to come.\e"
M06270009,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Hello and welcome! We are open and doing 
business with all that survived the fire. \e"
M06270010,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M06270011,"\h(《Item Merchant》)The Nasultan and all the soldiers were taken 
away to Valua. We civilians are the only ones 
left.\e"
M06270012,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Under the Red Moon, the kingdom of Nasr was a 
place of such glory and splendor. It is 
astonishing to see how fragile it all was.\c"
M06270013,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Thank you! May the Red Moon light your 
journey!\c"
M06270022,"\h(《Item Merchant》)What do you wish? Gentum?
Of course I have some.\e"
M06270023,"\h(《Item Merchant》)It is 500 gold per pouch. Do you wish to 
purchase a bag?\e"
M06270024,"\h(《What will you do?》)“I'll buy it!”
“Maybe next time.”\e"
M06270025,"\h(《Vyse》)500 gold? I'll buy it!
I need it to help somebody out.\e"
M06270026,\h(　)You bought “Gentum” for 500 gold.\c
M06270027,"\h(《Item Merchant》)I am sorry, but it appears that you do not have
enough money right now.\c"
M06270028,"\h(《Item Merchant》)Well, I have plenty in stock, so when you wish
to purchase some, just come back and ask.\c"
M06280016,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Man, I cannot believe it. How could Nasrad have 
been reduced to this?\e"
M06280017,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)The people who used to come here have either 
died or left town, and there is almost no one 
left.\e"
M06280018,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Perhaps there's nothing left to do but to close 
up shop.\c"
M06280019,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Welcome, welcome! Come on in, young man! Sit 
down and relax.\e"
M06280020,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Recently, some people have been returning to 
town, and business is starting to pick up once 
more!\e"
M06280021,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)I'm glad I did not close down. I do not have a 
lot to offer, but make yourself comfortable and 
stay awhile.\c"
M06290004,"\h(《Depressed Man》)Everybody's saying that the Nasultan and his
family were all executed.\e"
M06290005,"\h(《Depressed Man》)They say they were all dragged off to Valua, and
they were executed in front of a huge crowd.\c"
M06290006,"\h(《Depressed Man》)Hey! I hear the Rains of Destruction fell upon
Valua.\e"
M06290007,"\h(《Depressed Man》)What's did you say? The Queen and the Prince and
everyone else was killed? I wonder if the world
really is coming to an end?\c"
M06300007,"\h(《Sailor》)I'd heard that Nasrad was completely destroyed,
so I thought for sure this place was also gone.\e"
M06300008,"\h(《Sailor》)The only entertainment they've got is a shabby
old tavernkeep, but it still makes me happy that
they're open.\c"
M06300009,"\h(《Sailor》)There's been a lot going on around the Ocean
lately, what with a huge continent appearing out
of nowhere, and Valua being destroyed.\e"
M06300010,"\h(《Sailor》)I think maybe I'll stop traveling for a while-
though I don't suppose there's any guarantee 
that I'll be safe staying here, either.\c"
M06310014,\h(《Osman》)My shop! My shop is gone! It's too much to bear!\e
M06310015,"\h(《Osman》)My shop is nothing more than a heap of rubble,
and my clerk ran off with all the money... I am
completely ruined.\e"
M06310016,"\h(《Aika》)I feel kind of sorry for her. You know, Vyse, 
maybe we should take her with us on our ship.\e"
M06310017,"\h(《Osman》)Ship?
You own a ship?!\e"
M06310018,"\h(《Osman》)How big is it? How much cargo can it hold? How
much money do you make transporting goods?\e"
M06310019,"\h(《Osman》)Heh heh…
You may not look like much, but you seem to be 
doing well for yourself.\e"
M06310020,"\h(《Osman》)Okay, I have decided. I will go with you on your
ship. It sounds like I can make some money!\e"
M06310021,"\h(《Vyse》)Hold on a second! You can't just decide that all
by yourself.\e"
M06310022,"\h(《Osman》)I am an excellent trader. I can help you find
treasures that would normally be almost
impossible to find!\e"
M06310023,"\h(《Aika》)But I seem to recall someone saying that they
couldn't loan us even 1 gold without collateral,
because they weren't running a charity…\e"
M06310024,"\h(《Osman》)I, I understand. I apologize for sending you 
away so cold-heartedly before.\e"
M06310025,"\h(《Osman》)I will make you so much money that anything I 
would have loaned you before will seem like Moon
dust! Ahahahaha!\e"
M06310026,\h(　)Osman has joined your crew as a “Merchant.”\c
M06430004,"\h(《Young Maiden》)A massive bombing raid turned the bazaar into a 
heap of rubble. It had to be closed because it 
was too dangerous.\e"
M06430005,"\h(《Young Man》)Of course, since my house was burned down and
all my belongings were confiscated, I would not
be able to buy her a thing, anyway.\e"
M06430006,"\h(《Young Maiden》)Without money or a place to play, the only thing
left for us to do is sit here and whisper sweet
nothings to each other by the fountain.\c"
M06430007,"\h(《Young Maiden》)The Bazaar has not yet come back, but merchants 
and townspeople have started to return and 
things are starting to pick up once more.\e"
M06430008,"\h(《Young Man》)Maybe I will start a business of some kind. I 
wish I was able to take her on some nicer dates.\e"
M06430009,"\h(《Young Maiden》)I intend to work hard, as well. This time it is 
my turn to give him some nice presents.\c"
M06430010,"\h(《Young Maiden》)Oh, what news I have, traveler! I must tell you!
My boyfriend has asked me to marry him!\e"
M06430011,"\h(《Young Man》)My business is getting back on track, so I
travel more often now… \e"
M06430012,"\h(《Young Man》)and with all the disturbing happenings in the
world these days, it worries me to leave her all
alone in town.\e"
M06430013,"\h(《Young Maiden》)I am going to help with his business, too. That
way we can be together all the time, at work and
on dates.\c"
M06440004,"\h(《Young Maiden》)A massive bombing raid turned the bazaar into a
heap of rubble. It had to be closed because it
was too dangerous.\e"
M06440005,"\h(《Young Man》)Well, since my house was burned down and all of
my valuables were confiscated, I wouldn't really
be able to afford anything, anyway.\e"
M06440006,"\h(《Young Maiden》)Without money or a place to play, the only
thing left for us to do is sit here and whisper
sweet nothings to each other by the fountain.\c"
M06440007,"\h(《Young Maiden》)The Bazaar has not yet come back, but merchants 
and townspeople have started to return and 
things are starting to pick up once more.\e"
M06440008,"\h(《Young Man》)Maybe I will start a business of some kind. I 
wish I was able to take her on some nicer dates.\e"
M06440009,"\h(《Young Maiden》)I intend to work hard, as well. This time it is 
my turn to give him some nice presents.\c"
M06440010,"\h(《Young Maiden》)Oh, what news I have, traveler! I must tell you!
My boyfriend has asked me to marry him!\e"
M06440011,"\h(《Young Man》)My business is getting back on track, so I 
travel more often now… \e"
M06440012,"\h(《Young Man》)and with all the disturbing happenings in the
world these days, it worries me to leave her all
alone in town.\e"
M06440013,"\h(《Young Maiden》)I am going to help with his business, too. That
way we can be together all the time, at work and
on dates.\c"
M06450002,"\h(《Man》)I never expected the Nasrean forces to collapse
so easily before a Valuan attack. \e"
M06450003,"\h(《Man》)Alas, no one ever dreamed the Valuans could come
through the North Dannel Strait, what with the
sky rift blocking the way.\e"
M06450004,"\h(《Man》)They were caught so completely off guard that
the cannons on the palace walls never got off a
single shot. Boy, was Khazim mad!\c"
M06450005,"\h(《Man》)I am so busy nowadays! The market is starting to
pick up again, so more and more people are
coming through town…\e"
M06450006,"\h(《Man》)It will not be long before Nasrad regains its
place as a city of commerce. Start a business
right now, and you will make a killing for sure.\c"
M06460003,"\h(《Woman》)Whew! I was really worried about this town for a
while, but it seems to be getting back on its
feet.\e"
M06460004,"\h(《Woman》)I was among those who evacuated to another 
island for a while, but I could not stay away.\e"
M06460005,"\h(《Woman》)I wager the city will be back to its old self in
no time at all. After all, it is a town that 
grew up out of nothing in the desert.\c"
M06460006,"\h(《Woman》)I wager the city will be back to its old self in
no time at all. After all, it is a town that 
grew up out of nothing in the desert.\c"
M06470001,"\h(《Girl》)Somewhere… high above the skies of Nasr… 
A beautiful rainbow stretches
through the clouds…\c"
M06480004,"\h(《Sailor》)Yikes! I'm not gonna get back to my ship on 
time! With the bazaar gone, it's a lot harder to
get my shopping done.\e"
M06480005,"\h(《Sailor》)I still need to get that wooden leg for the 
Captain. Where under the Six Moons would they 
sell something like that, anyway?\c"
M06080002,"\h(《Former Fruit Vendor》)Gather 'round! Come see the cute monkey! Watch 
the monkey delight and amaze you with its 
acrobatic tricks.\e"
M06080003,"\h(《Former Fruit Vendor》)Without the bazaar, my fruit stand is also gone.
I can't even lay in stock to sell. \e"
M06080004,"\h(《Former Fruit Vendor》)I'm raising some capital with my acrobatic
monkey so I can rebuild my shop.\c"
M06080005,"\h(《Former Fruit Vendor》)Gather 'round! Come see the cute monkey! Watch 
the monkey delight and amaze you with its 
acrobatic tricks.\c"
M06060008,"\h(《Former Bazaar Clothing Stall Girl》)Hello, young man. How would you like to feel 
completely relaxed and comfortable? I can give 
you my personal attention.\e"
M06060009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“N, no thanks.”
“M, maybe I'll see what it's like.”\e"
M06060010,"\h(《Vyse》)N, no thanks. I'll pass.\e"
M06060011,"\h(《Aika》)Sorry, lady.
We're in a hurry. Come on, Vyse, let's go!\e"
M06060012,"\h(《Former Bazaar Clothing Stall Girl》)You really should not pass this up, sweetie. 
People say my pressure-point massage works 
wonders.\e"
M06060013,"\h(《Former Bazaar Clothing Stall Girl》)Alas, without the bazaar and my clothing stall 
gone, I do not know what to do.\c"
M06060014,"\h(《Former Bazaar Clothing Stall Girl》)Alas, without the bazaar and my clothing stall 
gone, I do not know what to do.\c"
M90390000,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Hy-ho-o-o! I am known as the Mystery Merchant! I
travel all around the world, selling my wares!\e"
M90390001,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Come, see the goods for yourself. I only carry 
rare and exotic items.\e"
M90390002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy or sell items.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M90390003,"\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Somewhere in this world, there exists an island
upon which grows a very expensive spice called
“Khale.”\c"
M90390004,\h(《Mystery Merchant》)Thank you very much. Until our paths next cross.\c
Ms013b000,"\h(《Vyse》)That's a pretty nice fountain.
It's strange to see them use water like this
when it's so scarce in Nasr.\c"
Ms013b001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's cool, clear water.
Almost makes me want to go for a swim.
Heh… That would be a little too embarrassing.\c"
Ms013b002,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder what's in the barrel?
Hey, homemade pickles! I hope they won't mind
if I have just a litle taste…\c"
Ms013b003,\h(《Vyse》)“Today's lunch menu…”\e
Ms013b004,"\h(《Vyse》)“Pasta of Pure Passion”
“Steaming Soup of Love”
…I'd be too embarrassed to order anything here.\c"
Ms013b005,"\h(《Vyse》)That's the royal palace ahead. It's surrounded
completely by water. You'd never think that
this was a desert kingdom…\c"
Ms013b006,"\h(　)“Enjoy the comfortable life that
you deserve. This way to Osman's Loans.”\c"
Ms013b007,"\h(《Vyse》)Mmm… This loqua smells great! It looks like
someone sure knows how to pick their Loquat
Berries right!\c"
Ms013b008,"\h(《Vyse》)Flying Fish soaked in oil, smoked Red Sardis…
They have all kinds of expensive foods here.\c"
Ms013b009,"\h(《Vyse》)It says there's Valuan loqua inside.
I guess trade is more important to
Valua and Nasr than being enemies.\c"
Ms013b010,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a well-made sieve.
It looks like it was made
by a master craftsman.\c"
Ms013b011,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, it's a miniature model of the palace.
It's made pretty well.
Hmm… almost makes me want to buy it.\c"
Ms013b012,"\h(《Vyse》)“Nasr Dance Lessons:
Learn the traditional dances of the desert”
I wonder if this is where Belleza learned?\c"
Ms013b013,"\h(《Vyse》)“Observation tower above. Leave your handprint!”
I wonder if I can get a good view of Nasrad
from up there?\c"
Ms013b014,"\h(《Vyse》)Now, that looks nice…
There's flowers floating in the fountain.\c"
Ms013b015,\h(　)Hum dee dum dee dum…\e
Ms013b116,"\h(《Vyse》)Oops…
It sounds like a woman is staying in this room.
I probably should just leave this room alone.\e"
Ms013b117,"\h(《Vyse》)But, that voice…
Why does it sound so familiar?\c"
Ms013b016,"\h(《Vyse》)Now, that's an old compass. I haven't seen one
of these in years! They sure don't make them
like they used to…\c"
Ms013b017,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a wanted poster… Hmm… Nope, no one
I know. To Air Pirates, having a price on your
own head is sort of a status thing.\c"
Ms013b018,"\h(《Vyse》)“Navigator wanted…”
“Treasure map for sale…”
There's all kinds of postings.\c"
Ms013b019,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow… This painting of the royal palace at night
sure looks pretty.\c"
Ms013b020,"\h(《Vyse》)“A real drink for a real man!
A taste of the desert, Khale-Relik Loqua!”
Huh? Who'd want to taste the desert?\c"
Ms013b021,"\h(　)“Soft pastries made by our master chefs!
Perfect for a light snack, any time of the day!”
\c"
Ms013b022,"\h(《Vyse》)So this is what Nasr rugs look like.
I hear they're really expensive.
…Maybe I shouldn't touch it.\c"
Ms013b023,"\h(《Vyse》)They have all sorts of spices. I remember Mom
used to use all kinds of different spices, too…
But, I don't think these are the same kinds.\c"
Ms013b024,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder what this stuff is… It smells a little
like medicine. Maybe they mix this with herbs
and stuff to make medicine?\c"
Ms013b025,"\h(《Vyse》)Ack!
…Oh, it's just a mannequin. It's just dressed
up in traditional Nasrean garb…\c"
Ms013b026,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a pile of weapons and ammunition.
I can't believe they just leave it
out like this.\c"
Ms013b027,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, a Nasr long sword.
Its long, exposed blade is unique
to this region of the world.\c"
Ms013b028,"\h(《Vyse》)This treasure chest is beautifully crafted!
I don't care what's inside… I want to take it
just for the chest itself!\c"
Ms013b029,"\h(《Vyse》)It's an expensive-looking vase. I wonder if
pickles made in a vase like this taste any
better than pickles made in a normal vase…\c"
Ms013b030,"\h(《Vyse》)It's an impressive safe…
I almost want to try to see if I can crack it,
but I shouldn't steal from civilians.\c"
Ms013b031,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a picture of some kind of golden bird. I've
never seen one of those things before… I wonder
where it's from?\c"
Ms013b032,"\h(《Vyse》)The sign… the cushions…
Someone must really like cats.\c"
Ms013b033,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what a beautiful fountain!
It's so weird that there's a fountain like this
in the middle of the desert.\c"
Ms013b034,"\h(《Aika》)The water's so cool and clear!
Maybe I can take off my boots and splash around.
…Or maybe not.\c"
Ms013b035,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, pickles!
No one's looking… Heh, maybe I'll just sneak
a little taste… Mmm! Good!\c"
Ms013b036,\h(《Aika》)“Today's lunch menu…”\e
Ms013b037,"\h(《Aika》)“Romantic Moonlit Desert Steak”
“Prince on a Dhabu Salad”
… These names are so romantic!!\c"
Ms013b038,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, so this is the Nasr royal palace.
A palace floating on water…
It's almost like a fairy tale.\c"
Ms013b039,"\h(　)“Enjoy the comfortable life you deserve.
This way to Osman's Loans.”\c"
Ms013b040,"\h(《Aika》)This loqua smells so good! I wonder who made it?
I bet the guys back home would love to have a
glass of this stuff…\c"
Ms013b041,"\h(《Vyse》)Flying Fish soaked in oil, smoked Red Sardis…
It all sounds so good…\c"
Ms013b042,"\h(《Aika》)Valuan loqua, huh?
I bet it's hard to get Valuan loqua here in
Nasr, so it's probably really expensive.\c"
Ms013b043,"\h(《Aika》)This sieve's cute!
It looks pretty sturdy, too. I want one!\c"
Ms013b044,"\h(《Aika》)It's a model of the Nasr royal palace!
Whoever built this must be an excellent artist!
I wish I could make something like this!\c"
Ms013b045,"\h(《Aika》)“Nasr Dance Lessons:
Learn the traditional dances of the desert”
Um… I really don't think I have the time.\c"
Ms013b046,"\h(《Aika》)“Observation tower above. Leave your handprint!”
I wonder if I can get a view of all of Nasrad
from up there?\c"
Ms013b047,"\h(《Aika》)How beautiful!
There's flowers floating in the fountain!\e"
Ms013b048,"\h(《Fina》)I don't think it's very polite
to walk into other people's
rooms, Aika.\e"
Ms013b149,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, sorry!
Yeah, I shouldn't just barge in.
Bad habit!\c"
Ms013b049,"\h(《Aika》)This compass looks pretty old.
Vyse loves looking at
stuff like this…\c"
Ms013b050,"\h(《Aika》)It's a wanted poster.
Doesn't look like they have one for Vyse…
I don't know if that's good or bad…\c"
Ms013b051,"\h(《Aika》)“Navigator wanted…”
“Treasure map for sale…”
There's all kinds of postings here.\c"
Ms013b052,"\h(《Aika》)A night view of the royal palace, huh?
It's kinda romantic…\c"
Ms013b053,"\h(《Aika》)“A real drink for a real man!
A taste of the desert-- Khale-Relik Loqua!”
…Ugh. No thanks.\c"
Ms013b054,"\h(　)“Soft pastries made by our master chefs!
Perfect for a light snack, any time of the day!”
\c"
Ms013b055,"\h(《Aika》)Oh, this is one of those really expensive Nasr
rugs. There's no way I could afford one.\c"
Ms013b056,"\h(《Aika》)There's all kinds of spices. I bet that if I
could use all of these right, I'd be a really
good cook. I suppose that's a big IF, though…\c"
Ms013b057,"\h(《Aika》)There's some dried… stuff. What is this stuff,
anyway? I don't think I've ever seen anything
like this before…\c"
Ms013b058,"\h(《Aika》)Yaah!
…Oh, it's just a mannequin. It's wearing some
Nasrean clothes… It sure scared me, though.\c"
Ms013b059,"\h(《Aika》)Weapons and ammunition…
It's all piled here pretty randomly.\c"
Ms013b060,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what a nice sword! I wish I had the money
to buy it for Vyse… I'm sure he'd love
something like this…\c"
Ms013b061,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, what an intricate treasure box!
Let's see what's inside…
Oops… It's locked. It won't open.\c"
Ms013b062,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, this vase looks expensive.
I'd better not touch it, just in case. Knowing
me, I'd probably drop it.\c"
Ms013b063,"\h(《Aika》)That's a pretty impressive safe!
It's got so many locks…
It's just screaming, “Open me!”\c"
Ms013b064,"\h(《Aika》)Hmm… Some sort of golden bird…
Maybe it's supposed to be good luck for business
or something.\c"
Ms013b065,"\h(《Aika》)What a cute cushion!
The cat on the lady's head must be the model.
She must really like cats.\c"
Ms013b066,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh, I almost forgot…\e"
Ms013b067,"\h(《Vyse》)Before we head off looking for Daccat's Island,
I should warn the king about Valua's plans.\c"
Ms013b068,"\h(《Vyse》)What's up with this picture?
It looks like someone just
made random strokes with a brush!\c"
Ms013b069,"\h(《Aika》)It looks like random brushstrokes, but if you
keep looking at it, it starts looking like
something… I just can't figure out what…\c"
Ms013b070,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… It won't open.
I guess it's locked.\c"
Ms013b071,"\h(《Aika》)It won't open.
Is it locked or something?\c"
Ms013e000,"\h(《Vyse》)This fountain used to be
so beautiful…\c"
Ms013e001,"\h(《Vyse》)Everything's changed so much,
but at least the water's still flowing…\c"
Ms013e002,"\h(《Vyse》)Whoa…
This was the entrance to the bazaar,
but you can't get through anymore.\c"
Ms013e003,"\h(《Vyse》)Whoa, this isn't good…
There's not even a trace of the shop left…\c"
Ms013e004,"\h(《Vyse》)The cargo's all been burned.
There's nothing edible left.\c"
Ms013e005,"\h(《Vyse》)They've started to rebuild the town,
but the scars are still left… I don't think
the people of Nasr will ever forget this…\c"
Ms013e006,"\h(《Vyse》)It's hard to read under the dirt…
I guess they haven't rewritten the menu
since the bombardment.\c"
Ms013e007,"\h(《Vyse》)“Today's specials…”
\e"
Ms013e008,"\h(《Vyse》)“Super Stamina Energy Lunch”
“Warm Fuzzy Feeling Salad”
… Interesting.\c"
Ms013e009,"\h(《Vyse》)Hey, it's a miniature model of the palace.
It's made pretty well.
Hmm… almost makes me want to buy it.\c"
Ms013e010,"\h(《Vyse》)“Nasr Dance Lessons:

Ms013e012,"\h(《Vyse》)Now, that looks nice…
