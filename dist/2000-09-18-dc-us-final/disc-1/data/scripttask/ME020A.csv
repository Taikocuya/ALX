M09000000,"\h(《Tenkou》)This is our headquarters where our leader, Lord
Daigo, resides. When preparing for battles, Lord
Daigo gathers all of the Tenkou here.\e"
M09000001,"\h(《Tenkou》)Just a little while ago, Lord Daigo issued an
order for all the Tenkou to assemble.
It smells like a war…\e"
M09000002,"\h(《Tenkou》)It appears that Lord Daigo will be returning to
Yafutoma. From now on, Jao and Mao will be
leading the Tenkou.\e"
M09000003,"\h(《Tenkou》)We have decided that we should only take weapons
from those with evil intent.
You Blue Rogues have inspired us…\e"
M09010000,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)We, the Tenkou, are citizens of Yafutoma.
No matter how long you live away from it, you
never forget your love for your country.\e"
M09010001,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)So, we consider Kangan's treason to be a very
serious matter. I know you are not even from
Yafutoma… but, please… we need your help.\e"
M09010002,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)I never would have thought that the Winds of
Retribution would be the winds caused by Bluheim
flapping its wings…\e"
M09010003,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)Even though they are from the same islands,
Bluheim is quite different from the little
Hamachous living around here.\c"
M09010004,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)Our leaders Jao and Mao, as well as the other
Tenkou, are not here right now. I think they
flew westward.\e"
M09010005,"\h(《Elder Tenkou》)They said that an important war had begun in a
country to the west…\e"
M09020000,"\h(《Tenkou》)Heh heh… a battle!
We haven't had a decent fight in a long time!\e"
M09020001,"\h(《Tenkou》)The Armada? I don't know who they think they
are, but they'll learn not to underestimate us!\e"
M09020002,"\h(《Tenkou》)You guys are pretty tough!
I can't believe you defeated that huge bird!\e"
M09020003,"\h(《Tenkou》)I didn't realize that there were warriors as
tough as you guys outside of Yafutoma!
You're really something!\e"
M09030000,\h(《Hamachou》)Kii kii!\e
M09030001,\h(《Hamachou》)Kak kak!\e
M09030002,"\h(《Hamachou》)Kii kii kii, kii!\e"
M09040000,"\h(《Kangan》)I, I don't believe that I've been exiled to a
place like… this!\e"
M09040001,"\h(《Kangan》)I, I am not supposed to be treated like this!! I
am the Royal Advisor! This is unheard of!\c"
M09040002,"\h(《Kangan》)King Mikado sent a messenger here just a little
while ago. It appears that in his sovereign
wisdom, he has forgiven us.\e"
M09040003,"\h(《Kangan》)I… I cannot believe that he had the compassion
to forgive such traitorous villains like
ourselves…\e"
M09040004,"\h(《Kangan》)We cannot disappoint him. We will return to
Yafutoma and work for the betterment of the
country. We must… for King Mikado.\c"
M09040005,"\h(《Kangan》)We will return to Yafutoma and work for the
betterment of the country.\c"
M09050000,"\h(《Muraji》)Daigo has commanded us to clean this shrine
every day!\e"
M09050001,"\h(《Muraji》)Why does someone of my status have to clean such
a filthy thing?!\e"
M09050002,"\h(《Muraji》)I used to be against touching anything that I
deemed filthy.
I thought it was below my station…\e"
M09050003,"\h(《Muraji》)But recently, I've learned the value of working
with one's hands.
It makes me feel… alive.\e"
M09050004,"\h(《Muraji》)When we return to Yafutoma, I plan to try and
make something of myself… without my father's
help.\e"
M09050005,"\h(《Muraji》)When we return to Yafutoma, I plan to try and
make something of myself… without my father's
help.\e"
Ms020a000,"\h(《Vyse》)There's something written here in Yafutoman.
It's probably the name of this shrine… if it
is a shrine…\c"
Ms020a001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms020a002,"\h(《Vyse》)Right now, we have to go talk to this Daigo
person. We should just leave this ship here
for now.\c"
Ms020a003,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Set out to do battle against the Armada!”
“Finish making preparations first.”\c"
