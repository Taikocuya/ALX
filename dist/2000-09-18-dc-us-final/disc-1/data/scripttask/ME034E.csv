Ms034b000,"\h(《Vyse》)There are all sorts of emergency supplies in
this box. Even on a ship as powerful as the
Delphinus, emergencies do happen, I suppose.\c"
Ms034b100,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube, just like the ones we used
on the Albatross. This one is probably connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b101,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey Vyse, this is Gilder from the bridge.
Where are you at?\c"
Ms034b001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b002,"\h(《Fina》)This is the bridge, over…
Oh… Vyse, it's you. Are you enjoying the
view from the lookout tower?\c"
Ms034b003,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b004,"\h(《Fina》)Bridge, here! Vyse, what are you doing!!
The ship is badly damaged! You need to
do something about it!!\c"
Ms034b015,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't have time to go to the lookout
tower! We're under attack! I need to get
out on deck!\c"
Ms034b005,"\h(《Vyse》)Thanks to this searchlight, we can fly
safely, even at night.\c"
Ms034b006,"\h(《Vyse》)There are all sorts of emergency supplies in
this box. Even on a ship as powerful as the
Delphinus, emergencies do happen, I suppose.\c"
Ms034b007,"\h(《Vyse》)Weapons need to be constantly maintained.
Otherwise, anything metal starts to rust and
anything leather starts to rot…\c"
Ms034b106,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b107,"\h(《Aika》)This is the bridge, over…
Oh… It's you. Quit playing around and get
back up here, Vyse!!!\c"
Ms034b008,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. This one is connected
with the bridge.\e"
Ms034b009,"\h(《Aika》)This is the bridge!!
Vyse?! What are you doing there! Hurry
up and fix this ship!!\c"
Ms034b010,"\h(《Vyse》)I suppose this is the best place to hang
laundry. It dries the fastest out here, even
though it doesn't look very nice.\c"
Ms034b011,"\h(《Vyse》)Since this ship has such a nice kitchen, the
crew can eat home-cooked meals, even way up
here in the sky.\c"
Ms034b012,"\h(《Vyse》)The ship's pretty badly damaged. I better
hurry up and fix her… If we get into another
battle like this, we're finished.\c"
Ms034b013,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like Muraji's locked this door. Who's
ship does he think this is, anyway?!\c"
Ms034b014,"\h(《Vyse》)The door's locked. I should make my way to the
bridge, anyway… That's where Muraji is!\c"
Ms034a020,"\h(《Vyse》)It's too dangerous to go outside in this
place. I should leave these doors closed
and locked.\c"
M02000002,"\h(《Marco》)Hehe! Look at this deck!
Not bad if I do say so myself!
I've been working really hard!\c"
M02000003,"\h(《Marco》)Those Tenkou guys had crazy hair!
I wonder if all the Air Pirates in this area 
have hair like that.\e"
M02000004,"\h(《Marco》)Vyse, you might have had hair like that if you 
were a pirate from Yafutoma!\c"
M02000005,"\h(《Marco》)It's been a while since we last came back to 
Crescent Isle! I wonder if Izmael built 
anything when we were gone.\c"
M02000006,"\h(《Marco》)I wonder how cold it is on the continent covered
with ice… I get a runny nose when it's cold.\c"
M02000007,"\h(《Marco》)Hey, did that old guy, Drachma, leave already?
Isn't he going to come with us?\e"
M02000008,"\h(《Marco》)That old man, he was really scary at first but, 
deep down inside, I think he's really nice.\c"
M02000009,"\h(《Marco》)When you were rescuing everyone from the 
Coliseum, he was watching you like you were his 
kid or something.\c"
M02000010,"\h(《Marco》)When we fly really low, my ears pop.\c"
M02000011,"\h(《Marco》)Hehe! Look at this deck!
Not bad if I do say so myself!
I've been working really hard!\c"
M02000012,"\h(《Marco》)Enrique was here a little earlier… is there 
something bothering him?\e"
M02000013,"\h(《Marco》)He looked really sad. I tried talking to him, 
but he wouldn't answer me. He must be really 
upset.\c"
M02000014,\h(《Marco》)I wonder why Enrique is going back to Valua.\c
M02000015,"\h(《Marco》)I was just sitting here, looking down at Dangral
Island… wondering when you guys were going to
come back…\e"
M02000016,"\h(《Marco》)… then this huge island popped up out of the 
clouds! I almost wet my pants when I saw it…\c"
M02000017,"\h(《Marco》)There was this beam of light that shot into the
sky… Do you know what that was?\e"
M02000018,\h(《Marco》)It… it looked like it was fired above Valua.\c
M02000019,"\h(《Marco》)Vyse…
Is it true? Was Valua destroyed by the Rains of 
Destruction?\e"
M02000020,"\h(《Marco》)I… I may have hated that place, but it was
where I grew up…\e"
M02000021,"\h(《Marco》)…Vyse, let's get going.
All of those innocent people died… the Armada 
has to pay for what they've done.\c"
M14110002,"\h(《Marco》)Hehe! Look at this deck!
Not bad if I do say so myself!
I've been working really hard!\c"
M14110003,"\h(《Marco》)Those Tenkou guys had crazy hair!

M14110009,"\h(《Marco》)When you were rescuing everyone from the 
Coliseum, he was watching you like you were his 
kid or something.\c"
M14110010,"\h(《Marco》)Is it true that we are going back to Valua?
I don't ever want to go back to that place.\c"
M14110011,"\h(《Marco》)Hehe! Look at this deck!
Not bad if I do say so myself!
I've been working really hard!\c"
M14110012,"\h(《Marco》)Enrique was here a little earlier… is there

M14110018,\h(《Marco》)It… it seemed like it was aimed above Valua.\c
M14110019,"\h(《Marco》)Vyse…
Is it true? Was Valua destroyed by the Rains of
Destruction?\e"
M14110020,"\h(《Marco》)I… I may have hated that place, but it was
where I grew up…\e"
M14110021,"\h(《Marco》)…Vyse, let's get going.
All of those innocent people died… the Armada 
has to pay for what they've done.\c"
M05210000,"\h(《Tikatika》)This place feels so nice.
You can see so far.
I love this place.\c"
M05210013,"\h(《Tikatika》)Captain, it is an emergency!
Enemies are boarding our ship!
You must go to the deck now!\c"
M05210001,"\h(《Tikatika》)That Tenkou ship flew so high, even above the 
clouds. Not even I can see it.\c"
M05210002,"\h(《Tikatika》)I was watching the deck when I saw Enrique and 
Moegi walking together. They look so happy.\c"
M05210003,"\h(《Tikatika》)Sometimes when I am watching the deck, Fina 
comes out alone. She sighs a lot. Is something 
bothering her?\c"
M05210004,"\h(《Tikatika》)I have seen Enrique come out onto the deck a lot
recently. He stares out towards Dangral Island.\e"
M05210005,"\h(《Tikatika》)You look very sad.
Did something bad happen down there?\c"
M05210006,"\h(《Tikatika》)The other night, Enrique came out onto the deck
with Moegi. She began crying.
He held her tightly.\e"
M05210007,"\h(《Tikatika》)After that, I did not watch.
They needed a private moment. 
I did not intrude.\c"
M05210008,"\h(《Tikatika》)It feels good to be above the clouds. I feel at
home. I shall enjoy being lookout here.\c"
M05210009,"\h(《Tikatika》)I was watching from up here when that island
rose up from under the clouds.\e"
M05210010,"\h(《Tikatika》)The birds and the fish flew away! This can't be
good!\c"
M05210011,"\h(《Tikatika》)I… saw.
Valua was covered in a light… as thousands 
of stars fell upon it…\c"
M05210012,"\h(《Tikatika》)Visibility is good… a perfect day for sailing.
The crew's morale is high! Keep it up, Captain! 
We can win this!\c"
M06330000,"\h(《Khazim》)Alright, men! Make sure to load those cannons
properly! I want those things ready to kick some
Valuan butt at a moment's notice!\e"
M06330001,"\h(《Khazim's Men》)Yessir! Right away, sir!\c"
M06330002,"\h(《Khazim》)What?! You let those Tenkou guys get away?! Bah!
You guys are useless!\e"
M06330003,"\h(《Khazim》)Who do they think they are, boarding our ship
like that?! Next time, we'll put a few holes in
'em!\c"
M06330004,"\h(《Khazim》)A continent made of ice?
Ice is that clear, cold stuff, right?\e"
M06330005,"\h(《Khazim》)I've heard that the Nasultan loves that stuff…
I didn't know there was a whole continent made
of it!\c"
M06330006,"\h(《Khazim》)Hey, make sure all the cannons are ready to go!
We're going to be attacking that island soon!\e"
M06330007,\h(《Khazim's Men》)Yessir!\c
M06330008,"\h(《Khazim》)Hey, put your backs into it!
We've got a score to settle with Ramirez!\e"
M06330009,"\h(《Khazim's Men》)Yessir! Right away, sir!\c"
M06340000,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)Leave the Delphinus' cannons to us, sir!\c"
M06340001,\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)Who were those guys with the weird hair anyway?\c
M06340002,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)As far as I can see, the whole continent is 
covered in ice. I wouldn't have imagined this 
in my wildest dreams.\c"
M06340003,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)We were all pretty surprised when that island 
just suddenly appeared in Mid Ocean.\c"
M06340004,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)The cannons are in good condition, Captain Vyse.
We're ready to fire at your command!\c"
M06350000,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)Don't worry Captain, we'll make sure that the 
cannons are always ready to go!\c"
M06350001,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)It was surprising to find people living on the 
other side of the Dark Rift… but it was even 
more surprising when we found Air Pirates too!\c"
M06350002,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)I have never seen ice. The only place in Nasr
where there is ice is in the Nasultan's private
ice room. Commoners aren't allowed in there.\c"
M06350003,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)Galcian is somewhere on that island?
We gotta get 'em!\c"
M06350004,"\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)Finally we can take revenge for what they did to
Nasrad! Let's get 'em!\c"
M08150000,"\h(《Kirala》)We're so lucky that we get to eat in such a 
beautiful place. I'm sure glad I joined this 
crew.\c"
M08150001,"\h(《Kirala》)People used to live on the ice continent?
Hmmm, I wonder what kind of houses they lived 
in. They must've been hard to build…\c"
M08150002,"\h(《Kirala》)Really? They lived in houses made of ice that
hang from the ceiling? I would've loved to see
that with my own eyes!\c"
M08150003,"\h(《Kirala》)You found all of those… what did you call them?
Moon Crystals? Well, I don't know exactly what
they are, but congratulations anyway!\c"
M08150004,"\h(《Kirala》)A platform that goes beneath the clouds?
They must have some amazing carpenters in
Valua…\c"
M08150005,"\h(《Kirala》)I've seen Princess Moegi crying by herself in 
the hallways…\e"
M08150006,"\h(《Kirala》)Even though she probably won't cry in front of
the crew, I bet she's torn apart inside…
She must really miss Prince Enrique…\c"
M08150007,"\h(《Kirala》)What?! We are diving to the bottom of the 
world?! But demons will eat us! Didn't your mom 
ever tell you that?!\c"
M08150008,"\h(《Kirala》)Watching that island rise up from beneath the
clouds was a little freaky…\c"
M08150009,"\h(《Kirala》)Alright, it's almost time to wrap this all up!
Let's show them what Yafutoman women are made
of!\c"
M08150010,"\h(《Kirala》)I can't believe your ship couldn't fly above
or below the clouds. That's had to be 
inconvenient.\c"
M14010000,"\h(《Izmael》)A continent with a city beneath the ice?
Unbelievable! I have got to see that!\c"
M14010001,"\h(《Izmael》)You mean to tell me that in that city of ice,
the houses were also made of ice and hung from
the ceilings like icicles?\e"
M14010002,"\h(《Izmael》)I can't believe it! You should've taken me with
you! People of the Old World must have been
great architects…\c"
M14010003,"\h(《Izmael》)That Book of Ship Polarity had some amazing
stuff in it… but can you believe Brabham? He's
still got some brains in that old noggin of his!\e"
M14010004,"\h(《Izmael》)Thanks to that old fart, this ship is the only
ship outside of Yafutoma that can fly up above
the clouds!\c"
M14010005,"\h(《Izmael》)What's wrong with the prince?
Has he got a stomach ache or something?\c"
M14010006,"\h(《Izmael》)When you go down into Deep Sky, make sure to
shut the pressure shutters.\e"
M14010007,"\h(《Izmael》)No matter what kind of environment Deep Sky may 
be, the extra-thick shutters will protect us!\c"
M14010008,"\h(《Izmael》)I wonder what the architecture of the Great
Silver Shrine looks like… I'd like to see it
with you guys…\e"
M14010009,"\h(《Izmael》)I bet there are tons of old buildings on that 
strange island. If only I could get a closer 
look…\e"
M14010010,"\h(《Izmael》)Great! Now I've gotten myself all excited! 
Vyse! Hurry up and kick some Valuan butt so 
we can go check out the architecture!\c"
M14010011,\h(《Izmael》)We can finally settle this thing!\e
M14010012,"\h(《Izmael》)I can't believe I'm still out here fighting a
war at my age! Hah! I'm younger than I thought!\c"
M14010013,"\h(《Izmael》)When I first met Enrique, all I ever saw him do
was throw up over the side of the ship. Now he's
become quite a sailor!\e"
M14010014,"\h(《Izmael》)I'm impressed that he's got the nerve to go back
to Valua!\c"
M14020000,"\h(《Belle》)I'm so sorry, Captain… I, I'm a little clumsy.
I dropped a cannonball on someone's foot
earlier, too!\e"
M14020001,"\h(《Belle》)I'll try my best though! Just give me some 
orders and I'll try not to mess up!\c"
M14020002,"\h(《Belle》)I was so surprised to see that the Lands of Ice 
were actually lands of ice! I almost fell 
overboard because I was so shocked!\e"
M14020003,"\h(《Belle》)When I regained my composure, I slipped on the 
ice and fell on my butt. I think I got some 
frostbite back there.\c"
M14020004,"\h(《Belle》)Finally, we're gonna try and make our way 
underground! I am not sure how well I can do 
this, but I am going to dig as much as I can!\e"
M14020005,"\h(《Vyse》)Haha… You don't have to dig!
There are natural fissures in the ground, so we
are going to enter there.\e"
M14020006,"\h(《Belle》)Really? Heh… heh heh… Oh, umm… That's good to
know. I was wondering how we were going to dig
through a continent…\c"
M14020007,"\h(《Belle》)Captain, I think there's something wrong with 
Fina. She's usually quiet, but not this quiet.\e"
M14020008,"\h(《Belle》)I hope it's not because I spilled water all over
her when I tripped over the bucket.\c"
M14020009,"\h(《Belle》)I tried doing some magic tricks to cheer Enrique
up, but…\e"
M14020010,"\h(《Belle》)… he just sat there. He looked really sad. I 
can't seem to do anything right.\c"
M14020011,"\h(《Belle》)I'm sure that Moegi has been dying inside ever
since she found out Enrique was leaving, but…\e"
M14020012,"\h(《Belle》)… I can't believe she hasn't been crying more.
She's so disciplined. I wish I could be more
like her.\c"
M14020013,"\h(《Belle》)Where'd that island come from?! How can an 
island just appear out of nowhere?!\e"
M14020014,"\h(《Belle》)It caught me by surprise and I accidentally 
knocked over a bunch of cannonballs! 
Why am I so clumsy?!\c"
M14020015,"\h(《Belle》)We are finally going to try and attack that 
island! I know I'm clumsy and I keep messing 
things up, but…\e"
M14020016,"\h(《Belle》)I've learned a lot during my time here on the 
Delphinus! I think I'll be able to do a good 
job!\c"
M14090000,"\h(《Lilly》)The Land of Ice… it sounds so romantic.
I wonder what kind of men lived there?\c"
M14090001,"\h(《Lilly》)All I ever do is polish cannonballs all day…
How am I supposed to meet guys when I'm doing
this all the time?\c"
M14090002,"\h(《Lilly》)I heard that you found all of those Moon Crystal
things. Everyone keeps talking about how
beautiful they are…\e"
M14090003,"\h(《Lilly》)That's so romantic… I want a man who is willing
to risk everything to find something as
beautiful for me…\c"
M14090004,"\h(《Lilly》)Enrique is going back home and Moegi isn't going
with him?\e"
M14090005,"\h(《Lilly》)If I was her, I would never leave the side of 
the man that I love.\c"
M14090006,"\h(《Lilly》)Where exactly is Fina's homeland?
Did you meet her family and stuff?\e"
M14090007,"\h(《Lilly》)Hmm… I bet you were a little nervous when you 
went there, huh Vyse? I mean… you and Fina are
getting kind of close… right?\c"
M14090008,"\h(《Lilly》)That handsome admiral is staying on that 
island that came up from Deep Sky?\e"
M14090009,"\h(《Lilly》)I swear… the best looking ones are always so 
weird. Why can't I just find a normal guy?\c"
M14090010,"\h(《Lilly》)Alright, let's do this! Heh… If I become the 
female pirate who helped save the world,
the guys won't be able to resist me!\e"
M14090011,"\h(《Lilly》)I am going to give it my best!
I know we can do it, Captain Vyse!\c"
M14100000,"\h(《Nara》)Just sitting here… polishing cannonballs under
this beautiful sky… it's so relaxing.\c"
M14100001,"\h(《Nara》)That dragon sure was impressive.
Was that thing one of those Gigas that you guys
keep talking about?\c"
M14100002,"\h(《Nara》)You're going to sneak into a Valuan base and
steal something? Wow… I'd be so nervous if I
were you…\c"
M14100003,"\h(《Nara》)Enrique hasn't been himself lately… 
Maybe I should ask him to join us out here and 
have him polish some cannonballs!\c"
M14100004,"\h(《Nara》)Even though he's in Valua, and she's here, 
they're both fighting towards the same goal!\e"
M14100005,"\h(《Nara》)That is so romantic…
Moegi, just hang in there! Enrique loves you!\c"
M14100006,"\h(《Nara》)That island gives me the creeps… coming up from
beneath the clouds like that…\e"
M14100007,"\h(《Nara》)Personally, I think we should fire a couple of 
shots at the island, just to be safe.\c"
M14100008,"\h(《Nara》)Finally, we are going to face off with Ramirez…\e"
M14100009,"\h(《Nara》)We have enough cannonballs to get us through any
fight. Make sure and use as many as you can,
Captain Vyse!\c"
M14030000,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)I would like you to know that I will be watching
you to make sure that you are worthy enough for
me to be on your crew.\e"
M14030001,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)If I determine that you are not the man that I
believed you to be initially, I shall
immediately get off of this ship.\c"
M14030002,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)It is impressive to see how you have
incorporated the technologies of Yafutoma to
improve the mobility of your ship.\e"
M14030003,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)Perhaps I, too, should learn the ways of the
western world and further hone my sword forging
skills!\c"
M14030004,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)That Prince Enrique… although his eyes are
filled with an unbearable sadness, they are the
eyes of a true and noble man.\c"
M14030005,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)The world beneath the clouds is where horrible
demons live and is not a place meant for
people…\c"
M14030006,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)The day that I devoted my life to my swords, I
gave up my family and my homeland. Since then, I
have not returned. I have never looked back.\e"
M14030007,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)But, had I been as strong as Prince Enrique is
when I was young, perhaps I could have seen my
parents once more before they passed away…\c"
M14030008,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)Do not let your impatience control you, Captain
Vyse. You have yet to face your worst enemy…\e"
M14030009,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)Remain calm. If you are not thinking clearly,
you might make a mistake that will cost you
your life and the lives of your crew.\c"
M14030010,\h(《Ryu-kan》)You are truly a man worthy of my devotion.\e
M14030011,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)I devote my life to you, Captain Vyse. Be it the
lands of the dead, I shall follow you anywhere.\c"
M14030012,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)I do not have the confidence in your ability to
lead. Somewhere in my spirit, I feel a sense of
hesitation to follow you myself.\e"
M14030013,"\h(《Ryu-kan》)However, I am a member of your crew.
And honor binds me to do as you bid.
You are free to do as you please, Captain Vyse.\c"
M14040000,"\h(《Robinson》)I didn't think I would live to see blue skies
ever again… I had almost forgotten how blue the
skies really were.\e"
M14040001,"\h(《Robinson》)I left Polly and Anne behind to chase my
dreams…\e"
M14040002,"\h(《Robinson》)To be stranded in such a horrible place… to
lose my memory… I am sure that the Moons were
punishing me for neglecting my family.\c"
M14040003,"\h(《Robinson》)I can't believe that I forgot about Polly when I
had amnesia.\e"
M14040004,"\h(《Robinson》)But deep down inside, I felt an emptiness in my
heart. The one thing that filled it, was gone.\c"
M14040005,"\h(《Robinson》)When I was on Sailors' Island, Polly was the
only thing that kept me ashore. She was the best
thing that ever happened to me.\e"
M14040006,"\h(《Robinson》)And now that my memories have returned to me, I
will never neglect her again. I'd rather die. I
now know just how important Polly is to me…\c"
M14040007,"\h(《Robinson》)A ship capable of going into Deep Sky, huh?
It reminds me of the days when I challenged the
Dark Rift…\c"
M14040008,"\h(《Robinson》)I want the Valuan Admiral who attacked Crescent 
Island to pay! Polly could have been killed in 
the attack!\e"
M14040009,\h(《Robinson》)I cannot afford to lose Polly again…\c
M14040010,"\h(《Robinson》)Everything that is important to me is from 
Mid Ocean. Polly, Anne, my tavern… \e"
M14040011,"\h(《Robinson》)That island appeared right in the middle of it. 
We've got to destroy it!\c"
M14040012,"\h(《Robinson》)I cannot say that I am strong enough to save the
world. I'm not pretending to be a hero either.\e"
M14040013,"\h(《Robinson》)But, I will fight to the death to protect Polly 
and Anne… and to protect the world that they 
live in…\c"
M14050000,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey, Vyse.
Making your rounds?
All clear over here.\e"
M14050015,"\h(《Domingo》)Heh… The Dark Rift, huh? It makes me feel all
warm and fuzzy inside just thinking of what kind
of treasures are hidden in there…\e"
M14050016,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey, Vyse! Someone is boarding the Delphinus!
You're the captain around here… Why don't you
do something?!\e"
M14050017,"\h(《Domingo》)Why are you wasting your time talking to me? 
Shouldn't you go and greet your guests? 
Better yet, beat them senseless.\c"
M14050018,"\h(《Domingo》)Well, Vyse… We've finally made it to the east.\e"
M14050019,"\h(《Domingo》)There are probably all sorts of things just
waiting to be discovered here!\c"
M14050001,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey, Vyse. I hear that you are going to the Land
of Ice. You're pretty ambitious. I wouldn't
expect anything less from you.\e"
M14050002,"\h(《Domingo》)Explorers from every continent have gone there
to uncover the treasures of the Old World… 
None have gotten past the thick layers of ice.\c"
M14050003,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey, Vyse.
I hear that this ship can fly to high and low 
altitudes now.\e"
M14050004,"\h(《Domingo》)I'm sure I don't need to tell you this, but you 
should explore as much as you can! I'll bet 
there are all kinds of discoveries to be made.\c"
M14050005,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey, Vyse.
I hear that you are an acquaintance of 
Captain Gilder.\e"
M14050006,"\h(《Domingo》)Heh heh… He's a real ladies man. I wonder if he
is still running from that female pirate.\c"
M14050007,"\h(《Domingo》)I knew Enrique was a gentleman, but I had no 
idea he was the Prince of Valua.\e"
M14050008,"\h(《Domingo》)I heard about someone kidnapping the prince,
but I had no idea it was you. Nice one…\c"
M14050009,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey, Vyse.
How was the Silver Shrine?\e"
M14050010,"\h(《Domingo》)I'm sorry I missed it. I'm gonna have to borrow
that ship someday and see it myself.\c"
M14050011,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey, Vyse.
We've got a spectacular view of Soltis from 
here.\e"
M14050012,"\h(《Domingo》)An entire continent, left undisturbed since 
the Old World. I'd love to explore it!\c"
M14050013,"\h(《Domingo》)Hey there, Vyse.
For some reason, all this talk of saving the 
world seems to suit you perfectly.\e"
M14050014,"\h(《Domingo》)I don't consider myself to be much of a hero,
but things are starting to get interesting
around here. Maybe I'll stay until the end.\c"
M14060000,"\h(《Ilchymis》)The Maw of Tartas was discovered 25 years ago by
a group of Valuan geologists.\e"
M14060001,"\h(《Ilchymis》)Since then, they have spent ridiculous amounts
of time and effort to try and break the 
Great Seal. No one has been successful.\c"
M14060002,"\h(《Ilchymis》)It appears that all of the Moon Stones that 
missed the islands have been accumulating
below the clouds for centuries…\e"
M14060003,"\h(《Ilchymis》)That would explain the amount of raw energy
below the clouds… and perhaps it would account
for the immense pressure in the air…\c"
M14060004,"\h(《Ilchymis》)There's a legend among the people of Mid Ocean
that refers to a civilization above the clouds.\e"
M14060005,"\h(《Ilchymis》)Perhaps they are referring to the Great Silver 
Shrine.\c"
M14060006,"\h(《Ilchymis》)I have read stories about the continent that 
sank beneath the clouds, but…\e"
M14060007,\h(《Ilchymis》)I never thought that it actually existed.\c
M14060008,"\h(《Ilchymis》)“The light that brings down the heavens…” I
read that in a Valuan book of prophecies.
That light we saw… worries me terribly.\c"
M14060009,"\h(《Ilchymis》)I ran away from Valua so I could research what I
wanted to. But this time, I will not run.\e"
M14060010,"\h(《Ilchymis》)We are going to win this battle and I am going
to find a place where my research will make a
difference in this world.\c"
Mp0040004,"\h(《Enrique》)Esparanza…
I can't believe we have to go to the southern 
tip of Nasr… that's awfully far.\e"
Mp0040005,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, I knew this wasn't going to be easy. 
I suppose saving the world never is.\c"
Mp0040006,"\h(《Enrique》)Years ago, Valua sent an entire fleet to try and
get through the Dark Rift. All of the ships were
destroyed…\c"
Mp0040007,"\h(《Enrique》)It's hard to imagine that we just came out of 
the Dark Rift. These lands are beautiful!\e"
Mp0040008,"\h(《Enrique》)Congratulations, Vyse! You're the first captain 
to ever sail his ship through the Dark Rift.\c"
Mp0040009,\h(《Enrique》)I've never seen a ship rise like that!\e
Mp0040010,\h(《Enrique》)I wonder what kind of engine it's using…\c
Mp0040011,"\h(《Enrique》)According to the “Spherical World Theory”, this 
world is said to be round, but no one has ever 
proven it.\e"
Mp0040012,"\h(《Enrique》)If we continue east and see Crescent Isle, 
then we can actually prove that that theory 
is correct.\c"
Mp0040013,"\h(《Enrique》)The Valuan Armada has sent many research groups 
to the Land of Ice, but…\e"
Mp0040014,"\h(《Enrique》)They have been unable to break through the ice, 
so they have never been able to explore what 
lies beneath it.\c"
Mp0040015,"\h(《Enrique》)We've acquired the Purple Moon Crystal, and now
we should head back to Crescent Isle. 
I do feel bad for Drachma, though…\e"
Mp0040016,\h(《Enrique》)The continent of Valua is full of canyons.\e
Mp0040017,"\h(《Enrique》)I assume that there are as many cracks and 
fissures beneath Valua, as well. There must be 
a way into the Maw of Tartas.\c"
Mp0040018,"\h(《Enrique》)Finally, we have gathered all the Moon Crystals.
Let's return to Crescent Isle.\c"
Mp0040019,\h(《Enrique》)I wonder what Galcian is up to…\c
Mp0040020,\h(《Enrique》)…\c
Mp0040021,"\h(《Enrique》)A design that enables ships to travel into Deep
Sky… I wonder what the Armada is up to.\c"
Mp0040022,"\h(《Enrique》)I will miss sailing with you and your crew, 
Vyse. I hate to admit it, but I'll even miss 
Aika constantly teasing me, too.\c"
Mp0040023,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, I will be back… hopefully, soon.\c"
Mp0040024,"\h(《Enrique》)We've got to stop Ramirez! Vyse, I know we can 
do it!\c"
Mp0040025,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse, will you let me go with you to Soltis?\e"
Mp0040026,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Of course.”
“We've got it under control.”\e"
Mp0040027,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course, you can come with us!
Without you, we never would have gotten the 
Delphinus. Let's go!\e"
Mp0040028,"\h(《Enrique》)Thank you, Vyse!
It is an honor to accompany you!\e"
Mp0040029,\h(　)Enrique has joined the party.\c
Mp0040030,"\h(《Enrique》)Well, just let me know if I can help, and I
will!\c"
Mp0030000,"\h(《Drachma》)I can't just sit around and let Valua destroy
everythin'! I want to help you fight 'em! We've
come this far, haven't we?\c"
Mp0030001,"\h(《Drachma》)You're sayin' that we're goin' into that 
continent? Boy, sometimes I wonder if yer head 
is a few Moon Stones short.\e"
Mp0030002,"\h(《Drachma》)But, if you insist on me goin' with you, I will.\e"
Mp0030003,"\h(《What do you want to do?》)“Yes, it would be great if you came with us.”
“It's best if you stay here for now.”\e"
Mp0030004,"\h(《Vyse》)Yes, it would be great if you came with us. 
We could use that big ol' arm of yours to crack 
some skulls.\e"
Mp0030005,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrumph… I guess I'll go with you, boy. I… I
never though I'd be fightin' with you again…\c"
Mp0030006,\h(　)Drachma has joined your party.\c
Mp0030007,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrumph! That's fine with me, boy.
But, let me know if you change your mind…\c"
Mp0050000,"\h(《Gilder》)I can't believe they took out Elder Prime right 
in front of us.\e"
Mp0050001,"\h(《Gilder》)Now they have all the Crystals. We've got to go 
to Dangral Island and stop them.\c"
Mp0050002,"\h(《Gilder》)Great, they got an entire continent with a 
shield around it as their new base. How are we 
supposed to stop them now?\c"
Mp0050003,"\h(《Gilder》)So, Galcian just plans to destroy whatever
countries he doesn't like, huh? Just like a kid
throwing a temper tantrum.\e"
Mp0050004,"\h(《Gilder》)I don't think he's going to stop with Valua.
He's not going to rest until the whole 
world gives in to his crazy demands.\c"
Mp0050005,"\h(《Gilder》)Alright, Vyse! This is it!\c"
Mp0050006,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, Vyse.
You're not thinking of leaving me behind are 
you? I can't let you have all the fun!\e"
Mp0050007,"\h(《What to do?》)“C'mon Gilder, let's go!”
“Sorry, but I need you to stay here.”\e"
Mp0050008,"\h(《Vyse》)C'mon Gilder, let's go!\e"
Mp0050009,"\h(《Gilder》)That's what I want to hear!
Let's go show them what we're made of!\c"
Mp0050010,\h(　)Gilder has joined the party.\c
Mp0050011,"\h(《Gilder》)You're breakin' my heart! Alright, I'll stay. 
Let me know if you need me. Oh, and if Clara 
asks, you don't know where I am.\c"
Mh6330000,"\h(《Khazim》)Hey, let's get ready! We gotta knock those 
Valuan ships out of the sky!\e"
Mh6330001,"\h(《Khazim's Men》)Alright!
Let's do it!\c"
Mh6340000,\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)We'll take care of your cannons for you!\c
Mh6350000,\h(《Khazim's Gunner》)Don't worry. We're ready!\c
Mh4110000,"\h(《Marco》)These decks will be so clean, you'll be able to
eat off of them.\c"
Mh4110001,"\h(《Marco》)Wow, you have to save 100,000 gold?!
I have never seen that much money before!\c"
Mhh020000,"\h(《Fina》)So this is the deck, and above that door is the
bridge.\c"
Mhh040000,"\h(《Enrique》)This is the lookout tower. All we need now is a
competent lookout!\c"
Mhh040004,"\h(《Enrique》)Ungh…
I didn't think the Delphinus would rock this 
much…\c"
Mhh040001,"\h(《Enrique》)Ungh…
We must find a way to acquire 100,000 gold 
before we do anything else.\e"
Mhh040002,"\h(《Vyse》)Well for you, Enrique, you have to conquer 
your seasickness first.\e"
Mhh040003,"\h(《Enrique》)I'm… very sorry about my current… condition.
I hope that by the time we can gather the money,
I'll be a better sailor…\c"
