MAC000000,"\h(《Would you like to try again?》)“I never give up!”
“I quit.”\c"
MA5140000,"\h(《De Loco》)I've been waiting for you, Vyse!
Now, you will learn the true power of the
ever-changing Chameleon!!!\c"
MA5140001,"\h(《Drachma》)It looks like he's serious this time, boy.
He's trying to get behind us.\e"
MA5140002,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse! Just make sure to watch out for that big
cannon that he fired at King Ixa'taka!
One hit of that and we're dead!\c"
MA5140003,"\h(《De Loco》)Prepare to fire the Moon Stone Cannon!
Halt all systems and redirect all power!\e"
MA5140004,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehe… You can't knock me off balance
if my ship isn't moving, Vyse! Heehee…
Now, feel the power of my Moon Stone Cannon!!\c"
MA5140005,"\h(《Aika》)The enemy vessel has stopped!
What's going on?!\e"
MA5140006,"\h(《Drachma》)It looks like he's got somethin' up his sleeve.
But, now's our chance. We need to hit him
as hard as we can while he's stopped.\e"
MA5140007,"\h(《Drachma》)We'll take a bit of a beating, but
we can take this chance and
hit him as hard as we can…\e"
MA5140008,"\h(《Drachma》)Or, we can play it safe and back away.
We won't be able to do as much damage,
but neither will he.\e"
MA5140009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take a chance and open fire!”
“Play it safe and back off.”\e"
MA5140010,"\h(《Vyse》)We need to take a chance and hit him with
with everything we've got! Let's take him
out for good!\e"
MA5140011,"\h(《Drachma》)Sometimes you have to take a risk to
win. Well, boy… open fire!!\c"
MA5140012,"\h(《Vyse》)We can't risk taking that much damage right now.
We need to put some distance in between us!\e"
MA5140013,"\h(《Drachma》)Perhaps that's the safest choice for now.
Very well… take evasive action!\c"
MA5140014,"\h(《Aika》)They're still just sitting there!
They probably used up too much energy
on that last attack!\c"
MA5140015,"\h(《Aika》)They've stopped again!
Vyse, what should we do this time?!\e"
MA5140016,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take a chance and open fire!”
“Play it safe and back off.”\c"
MA5140017,"\h(《Aika》)They've stopped again!
Vyse, what should we do this time?!\e"
MA5140018,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Take a chance and open fire!”
“Play it safe and back off.”\c"
MA5140019,"\h(《De Loco》)What's going on?!
Why didn't the Moon Stone
Cannon fire?!\e"
MA5140020,"\h(《Vice Captain》)Lord De Loco! The last blast
nearly drained all the energy from
the ship! We must recharge the cannon!\e"
MA5140021,"\h(《Vice Captain》)Perhaps firing this prototype Moon Stone
Cannon was too much for it to handle. I
think that maybe we should…\e"
MA5140022,"\h(《De Loco》)Silence! Silence!!!!
I don't want to hear any excuses! Fire! Fire!!
Fire the Moon Stone Cannon!!\c"
