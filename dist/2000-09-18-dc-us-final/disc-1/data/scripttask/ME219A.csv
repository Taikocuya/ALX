MF0140000,\h(《Aika》)Ugh… uh…\e
MF0140001,"\h(《Aika》)How did we end up in this place?
And where exactly are we?\e"
MF0140002,"\h(《Fina》)This place does seem peculiar…
I don't see Vyse or Captain Drachma anywhere… 
I hope they're okay.\e"
MF0140003,"\h(《Aika》)… They're probably fine…
They're both too stubborn to die that easily…\e"
MF0140004,"\h(《Aika》)Hmmm…
I wonder who saved us?\e"
MF0140005,\h(《Young Woman》)Oh! You're awake!\e
MF0140006,"\h(《Young Woman》)There's no need to get up just yet.
Let's see, what can I get you… \e"
MF0140007,"\h(《Young Woman》)How about a nice, hot bowl of soup?\e"
MF0140008,"\h(《Aika》)Sure! That would be great!
Oh, my name's Aika.\e"
MF0140009,"\h(《Fina》)And I'm Fina.
Thank you so much for saving us. 
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\e"
MF0140010,"\h(《Young Woman》)Aika and Fina… 
You both have such pretty names!\e"
MF0140011,"\h(《Young Woman》)You two are lucky that I found your lifeboat.
You were both unconscious.\e"
MF0140012,"\h(《Young Woman》)What exactly happened?
I love exciting stories.\e"
MF0140013,\h(《Aika》)……\e
MF0140014,"\h(《Young Woman》)Ah, don't worry about it.
If you don't want to tell me, 
I won't force you to.\e"
MF0140015,"\h(《Young Woman》)But, by the looks of you…
I'd say that you two are Air Pirates.\e"
MF0140016,\h(《Aika》)……\e
MF0140017,\h(《Young Woman》)Haha… looks like I guessed right.\e
MF0140018,"\h(《Young Woman》)You don't have anything to worry about,
my dear…\e"
MF0140019,"\h(《Young Woman》)Because I'm an Air Pirate, too!\e"
MF0140020,\h(《Fina》)What?\e
MF0140021,\h(《Aika》)Really?\e
MF0140022,"\h(《Young Woman》)Yes.
I am Clara, of the Blue Rogues.
Pleased to meet you!\e"
MF0140023,"\h(《Clara》)Ah…
I see.\e"
MF0140024,"\h(《Clara》)I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. 
Vyse is probably fine!\e"
MF0140025,"\h(《Clara》)You girls like him, right?\e"
MF0140026,\h(《Clara》)You have to have faith in your man…\e
MF0140027,\h(《Aika》)Um… yeah…\e
MF0140028,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MF0140029,\h(《Girl Sailor》)Captain Clara!\e
MF0140030,"\h(《Girl Sailor》)Captain!
We'll be reaching Nasrad in a few moments!\e"
MF0140031,"\h(《Clara》)Okay…
Prepare for landing.\e"
MF0140032,"\h(《Clara》)We'll be landing in Nasr's Capital, 
Nasrad, very soon.\e"
MF0140033,"\h(《Clara》)Nasrad is a very large city. Who knows? 
Maybe you can find out where Vyse is while
we're there.\e"
