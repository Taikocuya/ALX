Ms028a000,"\h(《Fina》)This machine was built to transport people
from here to the center of the Silver Shrine.\c"
Ms028a001,"\h(《Fina》)Each of the doors leads to a bedroom. However,
they are all empty now.\e"
Ms028a002,"\h(《Fina》)I don't even know if most of the doors still
work. It's… been so long since any of them have
been opened…\c"
Ms028a003,"\h(《Vyse》)We still haven't accomplished what we came here
to do. We can't head back home just yet.\c"
Ms028a004,"\h(《Vyse》)Galcian and Ramirez probably went back to their
headquarters. We should probably do the same!\e"
Ms028a005,"\h(《Fina》)They will probably be trying to raise Soltis
from beneath the clouds soon. I… I don't know
what will happen if they do…\e"
Ms028a006,"\h(《Fina》)Nevertheless, we should hurry back! We can't
waste another moment here…\c"
Ms028a007,"\h(《Vyse》)We should probably head back home.
We need to think of a way to destroy Soltis
once and for all…\c"
Ms028a008,"\h(《Vyse》)What the…?!
We're upside-down!!\e"
Ms028a009,"\h(《Fina》)Don't worry, Vyse.
We won't fall.\e"
Ms028a010,"\h(《Fina》)Up here, there isn't much gravity… The floors
themselves will hold us down. So, there really
isn't much difference between up and down…\e"
Ms028a011,"\h(《Fina》)Even though there isn't much gravity, we will
still be able to walk normally. Just make sure
not to step off the walkway.\e"
Ms028a012,"\h(《Fina》)Walking upside-down may be a little disorienting
at first, but once you learn how to get your
bearings, you should be fine.\c"
