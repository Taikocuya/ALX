MA0070001,"\h(　)Am I…
Am I home?\e"
MA0070002,\h(　)Fina…\e
MA0070003,"\h(　)Fina…
You… replace… Rami… the… Moon…\e"
MA0070004,\h(　)Elder…\e
MA0070005,"\h(　)However, watch… yourself.
…do not… allow… trust…\e"
MA0070006,\h(　)Elder…\e
MA0070007,"\h(《Aika》)How is she, Vyse?\e"
MA0070008,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… her breathing's more regular now. 
I think she'll be alright.\e"
Ms028e000,"\h(《Fina》)These flowers are not real. The Elders made
them. You see… no living creature, other than
the Silvites, lives in this shrine.\c"
Ms028e001,"\h(《Fina》)Elder Prime made this doll for me when I was
a small child. He's been like a father to me
for most of my life…\e"
Ms028e002,"\h(《Fina》)I spent most of my childhood days in this room
playing with this doll and with Cupil.\c"
Ms028e003,"\h(《Fina》)This used to be my room. I grew up in this
place… I have many fond memories of this
place… But, it was so lonely, here.\c"
Ms028e004,"\h(《Fina》)This device allows you to speak with and see
people that are across vast distances.\e"
Ms028e005,"\h(《Fina》)But, after Ramirez left… there was nobody
left for me to speak with, except for the
Elders…\e"
Ms028e006,"\h(《Fina》)You see… Ramirez, the Elders, and I are the
only Silvites left.\e"
Ms028e007,"\h(《Fina》)The Elders said that there is no point in having
more people here than is necessary… But, for
some reason, I always felt so lonely here…\c"
Ms028e008,"\h(《Fina》)This bed is actually quite convenient. The
sheets are automatically changed everyday.\e"
Ms028e009,"\h(《Fina》)But, I… I still felt more comfortable sleeping
in… normal beds. The kind that you all sleep
in.\e"
Ms028e010,"\h(《Fina》)Each bed felt so warm… so comforting… almost
as if they had been bathed in warm sunlight for
hours and hours. I… I don't know why…\c"
