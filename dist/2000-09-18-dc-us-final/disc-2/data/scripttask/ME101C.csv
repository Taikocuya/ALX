MA0050000,"\h(《Vice Captain》)Your Excellency, the sun is up and visibility is
good. The preparations for your escape have been
completed.\e"
MA0050001,"\h(《Alfonso》)Good work.
I have finished my preparations as well…\e"
MA0050002,\h(《Alfonso》)… preparations to dispose of a traitor.\e
MA0050003,\h(《Vice Captain》)W… what?\e
MA0050004,"\h(《Vice Captain》)P… please!
Your Excellency!!!
What are you doing?!\e"
MA0050005,"\h(《Alfonso》)I cannot tell the Empress that I lost my ship to
the Air Pirates in a fair fight. I am going to
need a scapegoat and you'll do quite nicely.\e"
MA0050006,"\h(《Alfonso》)To keep my glorious reputation from being 
tarnished, you must be sacrificed… \e"
MA0050007,"\h(《Vice Captain》)N… no!
You can't do this!\e"
MA0050008,\h(《Vice Captain》)Aaaaaaahhhh!\e
MA0050009,"\h(《Alfonso》)Even in death, he'll serve me well. 
I can't wait to tell the Empress…\e"
MA0050010,"\h(《Alfonso》)“But Empress, my own Vice Captain betrayed us
and allowed the Air Pirates on board… I could
do naught but dispose of the traitor myself.”\e"
MA0050011,"\h(　)So, this is how Valua treats its people…\e"
MA0050012,\h(《Alfonso》)What?!\e
MA0050013,"\h(《Vyse》)Now that we've taken control of your ship, we'll
be taking the girl as well.
There's just one more thing I need to do.\e"
MA0050014,"\h(《Vyse》)After seeing you kill an unarmed man in cold 
blood, I can't allow you to walk away from this.
Draw your blade, Alfonso!\e"
MA0050015,"\h(《Alfonso》)Hah… An uncivilized Rogue such as yourself
wants to challenge me? \e"
MA0050016,"\h(《Alfonso》)You aren't worth my effort, but perhaps you'd
like to meet one of my pets.
Come, Antonio!\e"
MA0050017,\h(《Vyse》)What? What is that thing?!\e
MA0050018,"\h(《Alfonso》)He's my personal war beast.
I was going to leave him here, but it seems I've
found a use for him after all.\e"
MA0050019,"\h(《Alfonso》)Antonio!
Trample the pests… and make their deaths as
painful as possible.\e"
MA0060000,"\h(《Alfonso》)Bah!
Perhaps there is more to you than meets the eye.\e"
MA0060001,"\h(《Alfonso》)Well, Vyse of the Blue Rogues…
You will rue this day… the day you stood
against the Valuan Empire. We shall meet again.\e"
MA0060002,"\h(《Aika》)You coward! 
What kind of a commander sacrifices his own men 
and his ship to run from a fight?\e"
MA0060003,"\h(《Aika》)Well, even though he was a coward, he was a
coward with gold…\e"
MA0060004,"\h(《Vyse》)True… I suppose that the ship and everything on
it officially belong to us now.\e"
MA0060005,"\h(《Aika》)We haven't had a catch this big for quite some 
time! The people back home are going to be 
impressed.\e"
MA0060006,"\h(《Aika》)And look at this girl.
I've never seen anyone dressed like that before.\e"
MA0060007,"\h(《Vyse》)You're right. She sure doesn't look like she's 
from around here. I wonder why Valua was trying 
to kidnap this girl in the first place.\e"
MA0060008,"\h(《Aika》)Hmm…
I wonder where she's from…\e"
