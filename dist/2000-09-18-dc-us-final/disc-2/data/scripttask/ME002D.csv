MA0100000,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Weapons, armor, gold…
Now THIS is a great catch!
One of our best yet!\e"
MA0100001,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Tonight, we should celebrate!\e"
MA0100002,\h(《Everyone》)Yeah!!!\e
MA0100003,"\h(《Aika》)Well Fina, this is what we do!  What do you
think?\e"
MA0100004,"\h(《Fina》)Well…
It certainly looks challenging.\e"
MA0100005,"\h(《Aika》)Hahaha… challenging, huh…
Well, now that you mention it, it isn't easy.
But it is fun!\e"
MA0100006,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the underground port inside of Pirate 
Isle. From the outside, this island looks like
a quiet, peaceful village.\e"
MA0100007,"\h(《Vyse》)But the inside of the island is where our 
headquarters is located.\e"
MA0100008,"\h(《Aika》)There are armories, shops, and even a tavern
inside here.
Come on, we'll give you a tour.\e"
MA0100009,\h(《Dyne》)Vyse!\e
MA0100010,"\h(《Dyne》)Come to my office immediately… and bring that 
girl with you.\e"
MA0100011,\h(《Aika》)Vyse… I wonder what that was all about.\e
MA0100012,"\h(《Vyse》)… I'm not sure, but we'd better hurry. 
You know how my dad gets when we're late.\e"
MA0110000,"\h(《Vyse》)Vyse and Aika reporting for duty.
And we've brought Fina like you requested.\e"
MA0110001,"\h(《Dyne》)Hmph… you're a little late.
I'll let it slide this time… Come on over.\e"
MA0110002,"\h(《Dyne》)Young lady, I am Dyne, the Captain of the Blue
Rogues. There are a few questions that I want to
ask you. Will you answer them for me?\e"
MA0110003,\h(《Fina》)Of… of course.\e
MA0110004,"\h(《Dyne》)Well then, on to the first question.
What is your name?\e"
MA0110005,\h(《Fina》)…… It's Fina.\e
MA0110006,"\h(《Dyne》)… Alright.
Next question.\e"
MA0110007,"\h(《Dyne》)I've been sailing for a very long time, but
I've never come across anyone wearing clothes
like yours.\e"
MA0110008,"\h(《Dyne》)What country are you from and why were you
traveling alone out there?\e"
MA0110009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Defend Fina.”
“Sit quietly and listen.”\e"
MA0110010,"\h(《Vyse》)Dad, you're worrying too much.
Fina is just a normal girl.\e"
MA0110011,"\h(《Dyne》)… Vyse.
Even though I am your father, I am also the 
leader of the Blue Rogues.\e"
MA0110012,"\h(《Dyne》)Therefore, it is my duty to not only protect
the safety of my family, but the safety of my
crew as well.\e"
MA0110013,"\h(《Dyne》)If this girl is a danger of any sort to you or 
any of my men, I cannot let her live.\e"
MA0110014,\h(《Vyse》)……\e
MA0110015,"\h(《Aika》)Cap'n Dyne, you worry too much.
Fina is just a normal girl.\e"
MA0110016,"\h(《Dyne》)Silence, Aika.\e"
MA0110017,"\h(《Dyne》)I am the captain here.
It is my duty to protect the safety of
my family and my crew.\e"
MA0110018,"\h(《Dyne》)If this girl is a danger of any sort to you or 
any of my men, I cannot let her live.\e"
MA0110019,\h(《Aika》)But… but…\e
MA0110020,"\h(《Dyne》)Fina…
It is your turn to speak.\e"
MA0110021,\h(《Fina》)……\e
MA0110022,\h(《Aika》)Fina…\e
MA0110023,\h(《Fina》)… I… I cannot say.\e
MA0110024,"\h(《Dyne》)Why is that?
Is it because we are Air Pirates?
Don't you trust us?\e"
MA0110025,"\h(《Fina》)No, that has nothing to do with it.
I thank you with all my heart for saving my 
life.\e"
MA0110026,"\h(《Fina》)But I cannot tell any living soul about the 
purpose of my quest. Even if it means 
sacrificing my own life.\e"
MA0110027,"\h(《Fina》)I have no intention of endangering any of your 
lives. If you believe anything that I say, 
please believe this.\e"
MA0110028,\h(《Dyne》)……\e
MA0110029,"\h(《Dyne》)… Alright then.
Heh… looks like I lost this one.\e"
MA0110030,"\h(《Dyne》)I understand your dilemma. And I can see in
your eyes that you are true to your word.\e"
MA0110031,"\h(《Dyne》)Although we're Air Pirates, we also have a 
strong sense of honor.\e"
MA0110032,"\h(《Dyne》)You do not need to divulge the details of your 
quest. Understand that you now have my trust… 
Be careful that you do not lose it.\e"
MA0110033,"\h(《Fina》)Captain Dyne…
Thank you kindly.
I will not disappoint you.\e"
MA0110034,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, Aika…
Bring the girl… Fina topside and give her a
tour of the village.\e"
MA0110035,\h(《Aika》)Now that's more like it!\e
MA0110036,"\h(《Vyse》)Way to go, Dad!
You're the best!\e"
MA0110037,"\h(《Dyne》)… It's not “Dad”. It's Captain!
I swear… how many times do I have to remind
you?\e"
MA0110038,"\h(《Dyne》)You're excused.
Don't be late for dinner.\e"
MA0160000,\h(《Vyse》)Mom!!!\e
MA0160001,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Vyse! Aika!
Thank the Moons you two are safe!\e"
MA0160002,\h(《Aika》)What happened here?\e
MA0160003,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)It was the Imperial Armada…
They came out of nowhere and attacked us.\e"
MA0160004,"\h(《Vyse》)What happened to Dad?
Where is everyone else?!\e"
MA0160005,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Your father said that if we fight, too many 
lives would be lost. So, he… he surrendered.\e"
MA0160006,\h(《Aika》)So Cap'n Dyne… and the others…\e
MA0160007,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)They were taken prisoner by the Armada and taken
to Valua.\e"
MA0160008,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn!
… Fina! What happened to Fina!\e"
MA0160009,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I'm sorry, Vyse…
The Armada took her too.\e"
MA0160010,"\h(《Aika》)In Valua, the punishment for Piracy is death! 
Fina will probably be killed, too!\e"
MA0160011,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, what should we do?!\e"
MA0160012,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Try and save everyone!”
“There's nothing you can do.”\e"
MA0160013,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you think, Aika?
We have to save our families… and Fina!\e"
MA0160014,"\h(《Vyse》)I know rescuing everyone isn't going to be easy,
but it's not impossible!\e"
MA0160015,"\h(《Vyse》)We can't let them get away with this. 
Don't worry, we'll get them back… somehow.\e"
MA0160016,"\h(《Aika》)… Yeah, you're right!
It's up to us. 
We can't give up now!\e"
MA0160017,"\h(《Aika》)Alright, let's go! Let's show those Valuans what
happens when they mess with the Blue Rogues!\e"
MA0160018,"\h(《Vyse》)What do you mean, “What should we do?”
We can't do anything by ourselves…\e"
MA0160019,"\h(《Aika》)Don't give up, Vyse!
Let's go to Valua and rescue them!\e"
MA0160020,"\h(《Aika》)We're the only ones who can. 
We're the only ones left, Vyse!\e"
MA0160021,"\h(《Aika》)I thought you said you won't give up on anything
without giving it your best shot!!!\e"
MA0160022,\h(《Vyse》)Aika…\e
MA0160023,"\h(《Vyse》)You're right. We should leave right away. Our
friends, our families… Fina… they're all
counting on us!\e"
MA0160024,"\h(《Aika》)… Yeah!
Let's go, Vyse.\e"
MA0160025,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Wait…
You won't be able to do anything against Valua 
in the shape you're in right now.\e"
MA0160026,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Don't just rush after them. You'll need a plan 
first. It's not going to be an easy fight.\e"
MA0160027,"\h(《Aika》)But, but…
If we don't hurry, everyone might…\e"
MA0160028,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)My husband always said, “Acting quickly and 
rushing are two completely different things.”\e"
MA0160029,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Especially in times like these, you must calm 
down and plan every move carefully.\e"
MA0160030,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Don't worry… everything will be alright.
He… your father won't let things end like this,
not him.\e"
MA0160031,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah Mom, you're right.\e"
MA0160032,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika… Let's rest up today.
We'll leave for Valua first thing in the
morning!\e"
MA0160033,\h(《Aika》)Okay!\e
MA0270000,\h(《Air Pirates》)Cheers!\e
MA0270001,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Haha… Loqua sure does hit the spot. Captain
Dyne really does know how to pick his Loquat
Berries! This stuff is good!\e"
MA0270002,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)Heh… it's been a while since we've taken over
an Armada Flagship. We deserve to take a
little break now and then!\e"
MA0270003,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Hmm? Should you be sitting here drinking loqua
with the rest of us when you've got a beautiful,
hard-working wife waiting for you at home?\e"
MA0270004,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Hey! There's nothing wrong with relaxing with
friends after a hard day's work!\e"
MA0270005,"\h(《Aika》)My, oh my… This place sure is full…\e"
MA0270006,"\h(《Aika》)Fina, this is our tavern…
They serve all kinds of drinks here: nectars,
juices, loqua…\e"
MA0270007,"\h(《Fina》)Um…
Excuse me, but what exactly is “loqua?”\e"
MA0270008,"\h(《Vyse》)WHAT?!
Fina… you really don't know what loqua is?\e"
MA0270009,"\h(《Fina》)Well… um…
I don't know exactly, but it appears to be a
really good tasting drink of some kind.\e"
MA0270010,"\h(《Fina》)Everyone seems to be drinking it so fervently…
it must be delicious.\e"
MA0270011,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)You want to share a bottle of Mur Loqua with us?
It's made from Loquat Berries and Moon Stones.
It's just a juice, but it tastes great!\e"
MA0270012,"\h(《Aika》)Nononononono!
We don't have time to just sit around right now!
We have to go talk to the Cap'n!\e"
MA0270013,"\h(《Fina》)Why?
Are we not supposed to be here?\e"
MA0270014,"\h(《Aika》)Well, the Cap'n is always getting on our case
for being late and stuff… I really don't want
to get into any more trouble today…\e"
MA0270015,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… Yeah, my dad can get pretty worked up
when he's mad. We wouldn't want him to have a
heart attack now, would we?\e"
MA0270016,"\h(《Aika》)Haha… You're so mean to your dad, you know
that Vyse? C'mon… We should probably get going.
Your dad's waiting for us.\c"
Ms002d000,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a picture of the Albatross.
My dad has had this boat for as long as I can
remember. She's a good boat…\c"
Ms002d001,"\h(《Vyse》)I never could quite figure out what this was a
picture of. Aika thinks it's a giant ballon, but
I think it's a big rock.\c"
Ms002d002,"\h(《Vyse》)It's full of my old man's books and other
things that he's picked up on our raids. I
wonder how old some of that stuff actually is…\c"
Ms002d003,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the flag of the Dyne Family. I've always
liked this design. It just says “Blue Rogues”
to me. It's a classic.\c"
Ms002d041,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the flag of the Dyne Family…
Don't worry everyone… I'll rescue you all!
I promise!!!\c"
Ms002d004,"\h(《Vyse》)These boxes contain all the good loot from all
of our recent raids. My dad always takes the
good stuff. Well, I suppose he IS the captain…\c"
Ms002d005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's filled with various healing crystals and
raw materials for medicines and stuff. Maybe
this is Erinn's emergency supply…\c"
Ms002d006,"\h(《Vyse》)Weapon parts… Moon Stones… This must be where
Zack puts all of his odds and ends. I wonder
if he's ever going to use any of this stuff…\c"
Ms002d042,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, it looks like everything is still intact
here. Those Valuans aren't very thorough. They
didn't take any weapons or Moon Stones.\c"
Ms002d007,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow… Fruit!! Erinn probably grabbed this from
one of our raids. Fruit is hard to come by…
Well, fruit other than Loquat Berries, that is…\c"
Ms002d008,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a barrel filled with loqua. After it's been
processed with the Moon Stones, the bitter smell
of Loquat Berries is hardly noticeable.\c"
Ms002d043,"\h(《Vyse》)Why didn't the Valuans take the loqua? Do they
not drink it in Valua? Well, I wouldn't know…
I've never been there before…\c"
Ms002d009,"\h(《Vyse》)There're loquas of all colors lined up on the
walls here. I wonder if loqua made with Silver
Moon Stones actually exists…\c"
Ms002d044,"\h(《Vyse》)Why didn't the Valuans take the loqua? Do they
not drink it in Valua? Well, I wouldn't know…
I've never been there before…\c"
Ms002d010,"\h(《Vyse》)We took this armor from a Valuan vessel a long
time ago. Looks like someone had a little fun
drawing on it. Looks much better now. Heh heh…\c"
Ms002d045,"\h(《Vyse》)It's hard to think that just a little while ago,
everyone was here giving cheers to our
successful raid on that Valuan battleship…\c"
Ms002d011,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. It's connected to my dad's
office. It allows him to issue commands from his
office to the guys sleeping in here.\e"
Ms002d012,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse!! Quit standing around and get your butt
over here on the double!!\c"
Ms002d013,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. It's connected to my dad's
office. It allows him to issue commands from his
office to the guys sleeping in here.\e"
Ms002d014,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, I thought I told you that these things are
only to be used during emergencies. I swear…
you never listen to a thing I say…\c"
Ms002d015,"\h(《Vyse》)Dad lets everyone eat a little better than
usual whenever we successfully raid a Valuan
ship. They always have the best stuff…\c"
Ms002d016,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the log from the Valuan battleship that we
just raided. Hey… Dad is mentioned in here.
He's famous! Heh… My dad's a great Air Pirate.\c"
Ms002d046,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the log from the Valuan battleship that we
just raided. There's mention of my dad in it.\c"
Ms002d017,"\h(《Vyse》)Most sailors feel at home sleeping in hammocks.
That's probably because they spend most of their
time out sailing. I prefer a nice, warm bed.\c"
Ms002d047,"\h(《Vyse》)I can only pray that everyone is alright.
Don't worry, Dad… I'm coming.\c"
Ms002d018,"\h(《Vyse》)I guess the guys get pretty thirsty at night.
Why else would they bring a whole barrel of
loqua into their sleeping quarters?\c"
Ms002d019,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. It's connected to my dad's
office. It allows him to issue commands from his
office to the guys sleeping in here.\e"
Ms002d020,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, quit standing around and come over here
like I asked you.\c"
Ms002d021,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. It's connected to my dad's
office. It allows him to issue commands from his
office to the guys sleeping in here.\e"
Ms002d022,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, I thought I told you that these things are
only to be used during emergencies. I swear…
you never listen to a thing I say…\c"
Ms002d059,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a talking-tube. It's connected to my dad's
office. It allows him to issue commands from his
office to the guys sleeping in here.\c"
Ms002d023,"\h(《Vyse》)Weapons are set aside here in case of an
emergency. We've all been trained to spring into
action at a moment's notice.\c"
Ms002d048,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn… The Valuans disassembled all the weapons
here. I don't see why they had to ruin all of
the weapons… Why didn't they just take them?\c"
Ms002d024,"\h(《Vyse》)We use these cranes when we're loading the ship
with supplies for long voyages. Food containers
and Moon Stone barrels can get pretty heavy.\c"
Ms002d025,"\h(《Vyse》)The crest of the Dyne Family.
This is my dad's office.\c"
Ms002d026,"\h(《Vyse》)These boxes are filled with Loquat Berries and
Moon Stones used in making loqua. Heh… This
stuff sure is popular around here.\c"
Ms002d049,"\h(《Vyse》)The Loquat berries are still in here. Why didn't
the Valuans take any of this stuff? Do they not
drink loqua in Valua or something?\c"
Ms002d027,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a barrel full of freshly made Relik Loqua.
I think it's made with Red Moon Stones. It's a
little too spicy for my tastes, to be honest.\c"
Ms002d050,"\h(《Vyse》)Why didn't the Valuans take the loqua? Do they
not drink it in Valua? Well, I wouldn't know…
I've never been there before…\c"
Ms002d028,"\h(《Vyse》)It's full of cannonballs. I remember when I was
a kid, my dad made me polish cannonballs all the
time. I really hated doing that…\c"
Ms002d051,"\h(《Vyse》)Looks like the Valuans took all of the
cannonballs that were kept in here.\c"
Ms002d029,"\h(《Vyse》)It's packed with weapons that we took from the
Valuan guards. I don't really see anything of
particularly high quality…\c"
Ms002d052,"\h(《Vyse》)Heh… Looks like the Valuans took back
all the weapons that we stole from them.
There's nothing left…\c"
Ms002d030,"\h(《Vyse》)It's filled with Moon Stones for the ship. We
use them as fuel. The Albatross is kind of old,
so she eats up fuel pretty quickly.\c"
Ms002d053,"\h(《Vyse》)There used to be Moon Stones in here. It looks
like the Valuans were pretty thorough about
taking as much as they could…\c"
Ms002d031,"\h(《Vyse》)The other side of this door is covered in rock.
That way, you can't tell there's actually a door
here from the outside.\e"
Ms002d032,"\h(《Vyse》)Whenever there's an enemy ship nearby, we open
up this door and use this big cannon here to
knock them out of the sky.\c"
Ms002d054,"\h(《Vyse》)Whenever there's an enemy ship nearby, we open
up this door and use this big cannon here to
knock them out of the sky.\e"
Ms002d055,"\h(《Vyse》)But, it doesn't look like anyone even got the
chance to strike back with this thing…\c"
Ms002d033,"\h(《Vyse》)My dad told me that he stole this cannon from a
Black Pirate when he was younger. It's pretty
old, but it's really powerful.\c"
Ms002d056,"\h(《Vyse》)It's the cannon that my dad stole when he was
younger. It doesn't look like anyone was able
to use it against the Valuans.\c"
Ms002d034,"\h(《Vyse》)On sailboats, ropes are used for just about
everything. Having good, strong ropes can mean
the difference between life and death.\c"
Ms002d035,"\h(《Vyse》)There are all kinds of building tools in here.
Hammers, saws, knives… The Albatross needs to
be kept in good shape, so we repair it daily.\c"
Ms002d036,"\h(《Vyse》)This is where we store various ship parts that
we steal from enemy ships. These boxes have
been sitting here for as long as I can remember.\e"
Ms002d037,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't even think my dad knows what's piled up
in here anymore. But, I suppose it's better to
have more parts than not.\c"
Ms002d057,"\h(《Vyse》)This is where we store various ship parts. Well,
now that the Albatross has been destroyed, these
things are pretty much useless.\c"
Ms002d038,"\h(《Vyse》)This is where we store most of the loot from our
raids. Later, we'll separate the stuff that we
want to keep from what we want to sell.\c"
Ms002d058,"\h(《Vyse》)It's hard to think that just a little while ago,
everyone was here giving cheers to our
successful raid on that Valuan battleship…\c"
Ms002d039,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the door to go outside… but it won't
open. My dad probably locked it. I should
bring Fina to see him first.\c"
Ms002d040,"\h(《Vyse》)… What's this?
The bookshelf seems a little loose… And I can
hear the sound of wind coming from behind it…\c"
Ms002d060,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to your ship.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms002d061,\h(《Dyne》)Vyse… Where do you think you're going?\e
Ms002d062,"\h(《Vyse》)Oops… I forgot to talk to my dad about
traveling with Fina. I should probably let him
know what's going on…\c"
M00010000,"\h(《Jimmy》)The Valuans came out of nowhere and just
started shooting at us! So many people were
hurt… I got hurt a little, but I'm okay.\e"
M00010001,"\h(《Jimmy》)I wish I was bigger… then maybe I could've done
something to fight back!!\c"
M00020000,"\h(《Alan》)Vyse!! You're back!! Have the Valuan soldiers
all gone away yet?\e"
M00020001,"\h(《Alan》)A bunch of ships came and all these soldiers
just started capturing people and Captain Dyne
and everyone else got taken back to Valua!!\c"
M00030000,"\h(《Lindsi》)A whole lot of ships from Valua came and started
shooting at us… They took everyone's daddies
away…\e"
M00030001,"\h(《Lindsi》)And… our houses… our whole village…
It was all destroyed… I don't know
what to do, Vyse!\c"
M00040000,\h(《Pow》)Pow… pow…\c
M00050000,"\h(《Martha》)Vyse! Oh, thank the Moons you're safe! The
Armada… they… they attacked Pirate Isle!!\e"
M00050001,"\h(《Martha》)They just came out of nowhere and attacked us
without any warning! Then they took all of the
men back to Valua!\e"
M00050002,"\h(《Martha》)They… they even destroyed the Albatross…
Your father must have been heart-broken…\c"
M00050003,"\h(《Martha》)That good-for-nothing husband of mine was
captured and taken away by the Valuans, too!
I… I'm a little worried about him…\c"
M00050004,"\h(《Martha》)Vyse, are you really going to try and break
into Valua to rescue the others?\e"
M00050005,"\h(《Martha》)Just… just be careful, okay? Don't break your
mother's heart, you understand? And Aika… you
better make sure Vyse stays out of trouble!\c"
M00050006,"\h(《Martha》)Just… just be careful, okay? Don't break your
mother's heart, you understand? And Aika… you
better make sure Vyse stays out of trouble!\c"
M00060000,"\h(《Barbara》)I can't believe the Valuans just opened fire
on us like that… It was so cruel. The children
were outside playing!\e"
M00060001,"\h(《Barbara》)Captain Dyne realized resistance would be futile
and surrendered quietly, but I'm sure he wanted
to fight back on the inside…\c"
M00060002,"\h(《Barbara》)I think your mother is in the Captain's office.
You should go in and see her right away. She was
worried sick about you and Aika.\c"
M00060003,"\h(《Barbara》)Your mother is doing everything she can to keep
calm, but in her heart I'm sure she doesn't
know what to do.\e"
M00060004,"\h(《Barbara》)Vyse… You must come home safely. I don't want
to think about what would happen to your mother
if you were to be… captured, too.\c"
M00070000,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)The Captain is the one who summoned you.
Go speak to him first.\c"
M00080000,\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Vyse! Aika! You're alive! I'm so relieved!\c
M00080001,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I hear that you've decided to leave.
Your father's told me all about it already.\e"
M00080002,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)But, I know you well enough to figure that it
wouldn't be long before you'd yearn to travel
the skies by yourself.\e"
M00080003,\h(《Vyse》)Mom…\e
M00080004,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)It's okay, dear. Everyone ultimately has to fly
away from their parent's nest. I knew it was
just a matter of when.\e"
M00080005,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I knew this day would be coming sometime.
It's just… It's just that it came a lot
sooner than I expected… or hoped.\e"
M00080006,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)So stand tall, son. Go chase after those dreams
that you've always talked about. And make sure
you take care of Aika, too, okay?\c"
M00080007,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Stand tall, son. Go chase after those dreams
that you've always talked about. And make sure
you take care of Aika, too, okay?\c"
M00090000,"\h(《Jessica》)Vyse, your mother is really worried about you.\e"
M00090001,"\h(《Jessica》)The last time I saw her, she was in Captain
Dyne's office. Go see her, Vyse…
Let her know that you're okay.\c"
M00110000,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)Hah hah hah! It's been a long time since I've
seen the Valuans get their butts beaten that
badly! Good job, Vyse!\e"
M00110001,"\h(《Timmus the Gunner》)And while I'm in a such a good mood, I think
I'll go up to the training center above ground
and have myself a good workout.\c"
M00120000,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)The Captain is the one who summoned you.
Go speak to him first.\c"
M00130000,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh, come right in.
This is a weapon and armor shop.\e"
M00130001,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Sorry, but I'm going to have to charge you even
if you are a fellow Air Pirate. I have to go to
a lot of trouble to get my stock.\e"
M00130002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk to Zack.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00130003,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Most weapons are forged out of Moon Stones.
Well, it's not the only thing used, but it's one
of the main materials.\e"
M00130004,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)And since weapons are made of Moon Stones,
they can be affected by other Moon Stones
if used properly.\e"
M00130005,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)To learn all the details, ask at the training
center that's located above ground.\e"
M00130006,\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh. Thanks for stopping by.\c
M00130007,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Captain Dyne ordered me to keep all of
the weapons locked up.\e"
M00130008,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)That's probably so the other Pirates don't raid
my stock. Otherwise, how would I make money?
Hehehe…\c"
M00130009,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Hear what Zack has to say.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00130010,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)If you intend to tangle with Valua, I
suggest you buy some powerful weapons.\e"
M00130011,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)We wouldn't want Captain Dyne's only son to
perish for want of a good blade… Heh heh heh.\e"
M00130012,\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Heh heh heh. Thanks for stopping by.\c
M00135000,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hey there Vyse. Or should I say “Vyse the
Ninny?” Hehehe… I've heard stories of your
misadventures…\e"
M00135001,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse. You looking to buy something?\e"
M00135002,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well… if it isn't little Vyse the Determined.
Are you here to buy something?\e"
M00135003,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well… if it isn't little Vyse the Respected.
I've been hearing about your adventures lately.
Just make sure not to disappoint your father…\e"
M00135004,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Admirable. I laughed when I first heard
that one. But, I suppose if you've earned the
name, you deserve it…\e"
M00135005,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Well, well… if it isn't Vyse the Bold. I heard
you're becoming quite the Air Pirate. Almost
better than your dad, from what I hear…\e"
M00135006,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Valiant… has a nice ring to it, eh?
I suppose you've earned the name… Just try
to live up to it, okay?\e"
M00135007,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)So, they call you “Vyse the Daring” now, eh?
Bah… I've known you since you were a baby. I'm
not sure if picking on Aika counts as “daring.”\e"
M00135008,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Hahaha… If it isn't Vyse the Dashing! I wonder
who gave you that name… A lady, perhaps? I
wonder what Aika thinks about that…\e"
M00135009,"\h(《Zack the  Weapons Merchant》)Vyse the Fearless… You know what? Ever since
people started calling you that, your dad hasn't
stopped bragging…\e"
M00135010,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)You've become quite the sailor, haven't you?
Not even your father was ever called a hero!
That's quite a name you've earned for yourself…\e"
M00135011,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)Vyse, King of Rogues… I wonder if your dad will
agree with that one… How about “Vyse, Prince of
Rogues…” I'm sure he'll like that one better.\e"
M00135012,"\h(《Zack the Weapons Merchant》)I can't believe an annoying little kid like you
would grow up someday to become a living legend.
Heh… Well, I'm honored to know you, Vyse.\e"
M00140000,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh, hello, Vyse! Do come in!
See anything that you want to buy?\e"
M00140001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to Erinn.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00140002,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Unlike spells that require MP, if you have a
healing crystal, you can recover your HP
anytime and anyplace.\e"
M00140003,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Some of the “tougher” Air Pirates refuse to use
them to save themselves, but I say it never
hurts to play it safe.\e"
M00140004,\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Thanks for stopping by. Come again!\c
M00140005,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Welcome home. I've set aside some special
items just for you and your crew.\e"
M00140006,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Use these items and make those Valuans
regret everything they've done to us!\e"
M00140007,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Hear what Erinn has to say.”
“Leave.”\e"
M00140008,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Don't worry about the injured, Vyse. I've got
plenty of Sacri Crystals in stock to take
care of everyone.\e"
M00140009,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)If all the Air Pirates never come home, I'll be
out of business. That's why I'm counting on you
to bring them all back, Vyse!\c"
M00145000,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh… Hey, Vyse. You know what? I heard people
have been calling you “Vyse the Ninny” lately.
I wouldn't let it bother you too much, okay?\e"
M00145001,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Oh, hey there Vyse. You here to buy something?\e"
M00145002,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Determined.
Sounds like you're starting to make a name
for yourself, there. Your dad must be proud.\e"
M00145003,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey, Vyse! From what I hear, you're starting to
gain a lot of respect out there as a sailor!
Good for you…\e"
M00145004,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Vyse the Admirable… It's a suitable name, I
guess. I bet you're popular among the ladies…
Hahaha…\e"
M00145005,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse. You know what I just noticed?
You're starting to look a lot like your father.
Maybe it's the way you carry yourself, now…\e"
M00145006,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Valiant. That name
makes you sound so… honorable. Hahaha…
I'm sorry… I didn't mean to laugh…\e"
M00145007,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)“Vyse the Daring,” huh? I suppose it's a fitting
name… I don't know anyone who's as craz… er…
I mean… daring as you are.\e"
M00145008,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Hey there, Vyse the Dashing. You really seem
be making a name for yourself as a sailor these
days. Well, good for you, Vyse.\e"
M00145009,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)So, now they call you “Vyse the Fearless?”
Haha… I can remember when you were afraid of
the dark as a baby! My, how things change…\e"
M00145010,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Well, if it isn't Vyse the Hero. That's quite a
nickname you've earned for youself, there. Just
make sure you live up to it, okay?\e"
M00145011,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)“The King of Rogues,” huh? Heh… I wonder who
gave you that nickname. It definitely wasn't
your dad, I'll tell you that…\e"
M00145012,"\h(《Erinn the Item Merchant》)Wow… I never would have thought that you would
become a legend! Everyone here on Pirate Isle
is so proud of you…\e"
M00150000,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)Hooray! We're home! You know, there really isn't
anything else quite like the feeling you get
when you reach your home port.\c"
M00150001,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)If you ever lose track of your position during
a voyage, just look at your map! You should be
able to find exactly where you are.\e"
M00150002,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)I'm sure your father showed you how to draw
a good map, so every time you explore somewhere
new, you should draw it on your map.\e"
M00150003,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)It's every sailor's dream to have a complete
map of the entire world drawn by his own hand…\c"
M00150004,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)It's every sailor's dream to have a complete
map of the entire world drawn by his own hand…\c"
M00150005,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)Vyse! Heh… I hear you've been causing plenty of
trouble for the Valuan Empire.\e"
M00150006,"\h(《Landis the Navigator》)All I ask is that you show them what we Blue
Rogues are made of. We gotta get them back for
what they did to us!!\c"
M00160000,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)My job is to guide the Albatross into the
underground entrance so that it can dock
in the harbor safely.\e"
M00160001,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)We use flag signals to communicate to each other
over vast distances. Right now, I'm coordinating
the loading of supplies onto the Albatross.\c"
M00160002,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Cannon shells… 20 rounds remaining…
Drinking water… 10 barrels remaining…
Um… What else…\c"
M00160003,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Thanks to the healing crystals that Erinn had,
all of my wounds have healed and I'm feeling
much better!\e"
M00160004,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Oh, and your new ship's called the Little Jack,
right? I'll resupply it for you, so you just
sit back and relax there, Vyse.\c"
M00160005,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)New ships are always so much nicer. I'll make
sure to load your ship with plenty of supplies.
Wouldn't want you to run out of fuel now…\c"
M00160006,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Captain Dyne ordered me to load the ship
with battle supplies.\e"
M00160007,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)I think the Captain is planning to go out and
cause a little mayhem of his own. Heh heh…\c"
M00170000,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne's orders… The exit to the
village above ground has been locked.\e"
M00170001,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)He said that you weren't allowed to bring the
girl topside until he's had a chance to talk
with her. You better go see him first.\c"
M00170002,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne said the girl… I mean Fina, is
permitted to wander freely throughout the
island. So, I unlocked the door.\e"
M00170003,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Also, there are two treasure chests in this
underground port containing emergency supplies
somewhere… You might want to look for them.\c"
M00170004,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)There are two treasure chests in this
underground port containing emergency supplies
somewhere… You might want to look for them.\c"
M00170005,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Vyse… what you did back in Valua was amazing!
I've never seen you fight so hard before!
You've become quite the Air Pirate!\e"
M00170006,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne has trained you well. I'm sure
you'll make a fine captain someday just like
your father.\c"
M00170007,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Hey there, Vyse. How's the sailing been?\e"
M00170008,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Captain Dyne is proud of everything that you and
your crew have accomplished. Keep up the good
work, wherever you go.\c"
M00170009,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)What?! You escaped from Valua again? And
this time you also stole the Armada's
most powerful ship?!\e"
M00170010,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Wow! I don't know if you're crazy or just plain
tough, but one thing's for sure… you're always
full of surprises!\c"
M00170011,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Have you seen our new ship yet, Vyse?
Captain Dyne had us build a new one…
It's called the Albatross II.\e"
M00170012,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)We still had the old blue-prints, so we were
able to reconstruct the first Albatross exactly
the way it was.\e"
M00170013,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Well, we actually upgraded its engines and
armor… But, just by looking at it, you could
never tell that it's much more powerful now.\c"
M00170014,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Now that we finally have a ship again, we can
get back to doing what we do best…
Being Air Pirates!!\c"
M00170015,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)Vyse… I saw that strange island come rising up
from beneath the clouds… I really don't know
what to make of it.\e"
M00170016,"\h(《Luke the Raider》)I don't know why, but that island… it just
LOOKS like it's begging to be explored. Hehe…
Maybe it's just me…\c"
M00180000,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)15 Pirates escaped with their lives…
And only a single bottle of loqua between them…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180001,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Heh heh! I've got a good singing voice, eh?
This's the song we Pirates sing when we're
forced to swab the decks…\c"
M00180002,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Sad is the fate of the captured Air Pirate…
They make his head part from his shoulders…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180003,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Man, that famous song almost came true for us.
We were so close to actually kissing the
executioner's block.\c"
M00180004,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)15 Pirates escaped with their lives…
And only a single bottle of loqua between them…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180005,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Pretty little lasses, all around the town…
Don't fall in love with a man of the skies…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\e"
M00180006,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Heh heh! The one thing about being an Air Pirate
is that it's hard to stay out of trouble. It
just sorta seems to come looking for you…\e"
M00180007,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)That's why it's my job to make sure the
Albatross is always in good shape. Just in case
trouble comes looking for us, you know?\c"
M00180008,"\h(《Peter the Deck-Swabber》)Pretty little lasses, all around the town…
Don't fall in love with a man of the skies…
And a yo ho ho, a yo ho ho.\c"
M00190000,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)You're the first visitor we've had in a long
time. Make yourself at home, miss, and don't be
afraid to ask for anything you need.\e"
M00190001,"\h(《Patch the Deckhand》)We Blue Rogues are friend to any travelers of
the skies. Well, if you're an armed traveler
with gold, it's a different story! Haha!\c"
M00200000,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Plundering treasure is fine, but just once I'd
like to find a well-built, handsome young man as
treasure instead of the usual.\e"
M00200001,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)… Of course, if I did that, I'd be just like a
Black Pirate instead of a Blue Rogue. Oh well, I
suppose that means it's off limits.\c"
M00200002,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)… But, to be honest, I really would like to
kidnap a man for myself someday! Hahaha…\c"
M00200003,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Vyse, if you're going out on a voyage,
make sure that you've equipped your best
weapons and armor.\e"
M00200004,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)An Air Pirate needs to be sure that his swords
and his wits are always sharp.\c"
M00200005,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)It looks like this this is it, Vyse.
The final battle… Are you really ready
to fight Galcian and Ramirez?\e"
M00200006,"\h(《Mabel the Raider》)Now that I think about it, that Ramirez
fellow was actually a pretty good-looking guy.
I'm so bad… Hehehe…\c"
M00210000,\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)Everyone got captured while I was sleeping!\e
M00210001,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I was going to try and chase them down, but
the Valuans destroyed the Albatross…\e"
M00210002,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)What are we supposed to do now, Vyse?!
We have to try and help them somehow!\c"
M00210003,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)What are we supposed to do now, Vyse?!
We have to try and help them somehow!\c"
M00210004,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I've been so worried about Captain Dyne and the
others that I can't sleep at all…\e"
M00210005,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)You need to succeed in rescuing everyone so
that I can get some sleep again!\c"
M00210006,"\h(《Matthew the Deckhand》)I can't believe I overslept and everyone
else left without me… You figure they'd
wake me up or something…\c"
M00230000,"\h(《Dyne》)Now listen up, Vyse. There are times when
something other than brute strength or
sharpness of mind is demanded of a man.\e"
M00230001,"\h(《Dyne》)Sometimes you have to have a firm grasp of the
entire situation at hand. That's when you need
to learn how to be a Swashbuckler.\e"
M00230002,"\h(《Dyne》)People will notice how you behave in various
situations and you'll begin to earn a reputation
based on those actions.\e"
M00230003,"\h(《Dyne》)That's why you need to try and be as
adventuresome as possible, without forgetting
your leadership responsibilities, okay?\c"
M00230004,"\h(《Dyne》)Your “Swashbuckler Rating” is a quality that you
must cultivate in your words and actions every
day of your life. Never forget that.\c"
M00230005,"\h(《Dyne》)What's wrong, Vyse?
You're looking uncharacteristically grim.\e"
M00230006,"\h(《Vyse》)Dad… Actually, there's something that
I have to tell you…\e"
M00230007,"\h(《Dyne》)Don't worry…
I have a feeling that I already know
what you're going to say.\e"
M00230008,"\h(《Dyne》)I remember when I was your age… The feeling
that I had to get away from my own little island
and see the rest of the world.\e"
M00230009,"\h(《Dyne》)But when a man decides to step out onto his
own path, he doesn't need to ask for his
parents' permission.\e"
M00230010,"\h(《Dyne》)From now on, you are my equal, son.
A man who lives by the skies. There is
nothing more honorable than that…\e"
M00230011,"\h(《Dyne》)Heh… You're late on almost every other
occasion, but you sure aren't wasting any time
to try and get out on your own…\e"
M00230012,\h(《Vyse》)Dad…\e
M00230013,"\h(《Dyne》)Go on, get out of here, Vyse.
Go make your mark in the world.\c"
M00230014,"\h(《Dyne》)Go on, get out of here, Vyse.
Go make your mark in the world.\c"
M00230015,"\h(《Dyne》)Now listen up, Vyse. There are times when

must cultivate in your words and actions every
day of your life. Never forget that.\c"
M00230020,"\h(《Dyne》)Heh heh heh. I feel remarkably calm
considering that the enemy is about
to hit me with the best of their best.\e"
M00230021,"\h(《Dyne》)But that's good. It puts the crew at
ease if the captain looks like he's
calm and fully in control.\e"
M00230022,"\h(《Dyne》)But, it all comes down to this battle. I've got
to keep my eyes open and just keep my men alive.
