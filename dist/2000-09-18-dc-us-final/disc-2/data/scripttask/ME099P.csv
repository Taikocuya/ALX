MJ0250000,"\h(《Vyse》)Well then… shall we head back to Crescent Isle 
and get Fina's ship ready?\e"
MJ0250001,\h(《Aika》)……\e
MJ0250002,"\h(《Aika》)Enrique left us…
And once we get back to Crescent Isle… 
Fina will leave us, too…\e"
MJ0250003,\h(《Aika》)It… it kind of makes me not want to go home…\e
MJ0250004,"\h(《Aika》)Haha…
What am I talking about? I'm sorry, Fina.\e"
MJ0250005,\h(《Fina》)Aika… I will… miss you…\e
MJ0250006,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the first time in my life that I haven't
been excited about sailing somewhere…\e"
M80200000,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M80200001,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M80200002,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M81200000,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)We are the Nasr Air Guard. Our primary
responsibility is to defend Nasrad from
invaders.\e"
M81200001,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)In order for the Valuan Armada to invade us,
they will have to go through the strait.\c"
M80210000,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M80210001,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M80210002,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M81210000,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)Hah! The Valuans are overconfident. They think
their Armada is unstoppable. Let them try to get
past us.\e"
M81210001,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)It doesn't matter how many ships they have. If
they try to rush through the strait, we'll just
pick them off.\c"
M90010000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)This region of the sky is like a giant maze.
There are sky rifts and islands all over the
place.\e"
M90010001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)We need to be careful around here. There are
lots of spots where Air Pirates can hide and
ambush us.\c"
M90010002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Shrine Island? Forget it. No one in their right
mind would go near the place.\e"
M90010003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I've heard that there are monsters on that
island, and if you fly close enough, you can
hear them at night when the winds are still.\c"
M90010004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)It was incredible! I heard this really loud
rumble, and my ship started shaking. I looked
over the side…\e"
M90010005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)… I saw a whole fleet of Valuan warships. I
wonder where they were going. With a fleet that
large, they must have been attacking someone.\c"
M90010006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you're looking for Sailors' Island, it's
northeast of here. Just look for the
lighthouse… it'll guide you to the port.\e"
M90010007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You'll see it right after you go through the
rock tunnel.\c"
M90010008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)From what I hear, Valua has added another
admiral to it's ranks. That makes six main
fleets in the Armada now.\e"
M90010009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)With that many ships, they must be up to
something. I wouldn't want to get on their bad
side.\c"
M90010010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Where'd you get that ship?! I've never seen a
ship like that before!\e"
M90010011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Wait a second… That's a Valuan Ship! You stole
it!!! You're either very brave… or very
stupid!\c"
M90010012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Is that right? There's really a land called
Yafutoma in the far east?\e"
M90010013,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)What?! You say you can reach Yafutoma by going
west, too? Wait… I don't get it…\c"
M90010014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe it… Valua has been completely
destroyed. You can still smell the smoke at 100
leagues, if you're downwind.\c"
M90020000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Say, you must be members of the infamous Dyne
Clan. We've been hearing a lot about you guys
lately!\e"
M90020001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)We hear you've been really stirring things up
over in Valua. Keep up the good work.
We're behind you all the way.\c"
M90020002,\h(《Merchant Ship》)I saw a Moon Stone hit Shrine Island yesterday.\e
M90020003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That stone is as good as gone. You'd have to be
crazy to go after it. Shrine Island is haunted,
you know.\c"
M90020004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You're going to Valua? Just head north from
here. It should be easy to find. But, you'll
need a passport to get in.\e"
M90020005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Passports are usually only issued to a very
small number of merchants who are permitted to
trade with Valua.\c"
M90020006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I just heard that the Ship Parts Merchant in
Sailors' Island just got in a shipment of
Secondary Cannons.\e"
M90020007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)All of the stores in Sailors' Island get regular
shipments of new goods every now and then. You
should check back there often.\c"
M90020008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)A Valuan ship! Please spare me! I have done
nothing wrong! I have a family to feed!!\e"
M90020009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)What? You're Air Pirates? Heh… You scared me
there for a second. But wait… I suppose I
should still be scared, huh?\c"
M90020010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You said you sailed around the world? Ha! Yeah,
right! What kind of fool do you take me for?
Everyone knows the world is flat!\c"
M90020011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That massive island came up from Deep Sky and
now the sky rifts are gone!\e"
M90020012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I wonder if the sky rifts were formed when the
island sank into Deep Sky in the first place.\c"
M90020013,\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe that island rose from Deep Sky!\e
M90020014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Think of the impact that it's going to have on
all of the trade routes.\c"
M90200000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)This region is called Mid Ocean. All of the
trade routes pass through here.\e"
M90200001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)That's Sailors' Island, over there. It's in the
middle of all of the trade routes, so it's a
great place to gather information.\c"
M90200002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Wow! That's an impressive weapon you have there.
Hey, is that a Harpoon Cannon? I've heard those
things can blast through stone reefs!\e"
M90200003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you pass through that stone reef, and
continue west, you'll see Nasr. You'll know
you're there when you see a huge desert.\c"
M90200004,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Have you heard? They say that Nasrad, the
capital of Nasr, has been destroyed.\e"
M90200005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)An Admiral named Ramirez leveled the place. Some
of the merchants are helping the refugees.\c"
M90200006,\h(《Merchant Ship》)They've reopened the route to Cape Victory!\e
M90200007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Now that engineers are developing engines that
can power through sky rifts, it's even safe to
go to Esparanza now!\e"
M90200008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)A few advances in technology can really change
the world.\c"
M90200009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I heard a rumble, then there were some strong
gusts of wind. I was trying to keep control of
my ship, and that island came out of nowhere!\e"
M90200010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Some merchants see this as an opportunity to
make a profit, but not me! I'm more concerned
with staying alive!\c"
M90200011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You guys are amazing! You actually defeated the
Valuan Armada! I can't believe it!\e"
M90200012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)But the Valuans still have a base on that huge
island! I hope you can send that thing back into
Deep Sky where it belongs!\c"
M91200000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Just recently, trade routes have been
established in North Ocean!\e"
M91200001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I heard that Gordo, the Air Pirate, actually
opened a restaurant out there, and I heard
that the food is really good, too!\c"
M91200002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I'm not about to let that new continent scare me
away! Trade has been better than ever, lately.\e"
M91200003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I know Air Pirates spend all their time going
after treasure, but we have to make an honest
living.\c"
M90210000,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)If you head due north from here, you'll run into
Valua.\e"
M90210001,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Be careful, they won't let you in without a
Valuan Passport. And forget about sneaking
in, there are patrols all over the place.\c"
M90210002,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You guys are pirates, aren't you? If you are,
I'd stay clear of Valua. If they catch you,
you're as good as dead.\e"
M90210003,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Valua has strict laws against piracy. If they
even think you're a pirate, they bring you to
the Coliseum and execute you.\c"
M90210004,\h(《Merchant Ship》)Did you hear what happened in Valua?\e
M90210005,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)There's rumors that someone actually broke out
of the Grand Fortress. I'd like to meet that
guy, and shake his hand.\c"
M90210006,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I've seen a lot of Valuan construction ships in
the area. They must be working on something
pretty big.\c"
M90210007,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)Hey, did you hear? Valua is constructing a new
base. They are building it on Dangral Island.\e"
M90210008,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)None of our ships can fly low enough to get a
good look at it, but there's been lots of
construction ships in the area.\e"
M90210009,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)With that ship of yours, you might be able to
see what's going on. Go south and and start
searching under the clouds. You can't miss it.\c"
M90210010,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)You should be able to see the base, if you fly
south from here and search under the clouds.\c"
M90210011,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)There's been a lot of Valuan ships around here
lately, so we figured that they were up to
something…\e"
M90210012,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)But I never would have guessed that they were
capable of raising an entire continent out of
Deep Sky.\c"
M90210013,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)I can't believe it! You guys were amazing! I
never thought I'd see all of the Air Pirates
join forces and attack the Armada head on.\e"
M90210014,"\h(《Merchant Ship》)By winning that battle, you guys changed the 
course of the world! Who knows what would 
have happened if the Armada had won?\c"
M90050000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Welcome to Nasr, the desert kingdom!\e"
M90050001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)There's a port called Maramba nearby. Your ship
looks like it's been through quite a bit. Maybe
you should restock your supplies there.\c"
M90050002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)It looks like your ship is from Nasr, but you
don't look Nasrean. I should warn you…\e"
M90050003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)With a ship that small, you would never make it
through the stone reefs that surround our
beautiful desert. You should turn back.\c"
M90050004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you go southwest from here, you'll reach
South Ocean, there are some really strong
headwinds there, so be careful.\e"
M90050005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)It is uncharted territory… no one has ever made
it through South Ocean before, although many
have tried.\c"
M90050006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Cape Victory? I've heard of it. It's on the
southern tip of Nasr.\e"
M90050007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you want to go there, although I can't
imagine why anyone would go there, you'll have
to fly through a sky rift. Good luck trying…\c"
M90050008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Items from the newly discovered continent have
already begun to make their way into the
marketplaces of the rest of the world.\e"
M90050009,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Nasrad may have been destroyed, but as long as
there are goods to trade, merchants like us
will survive.\c"
M90050010,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Soltis… Yes, I've heard that name before. It
was the name of an ancient civilization.
Some of our historians have records of it.\e"
M90050011,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)The legends state that the Moons themselves
pushed the entire continent into Deep Sky.\c"
M90060000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Hail, travelers! I am a merchant from the
Kingdom of Nasr.\e"
M90060001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)My primary trade is in carpets and Red Moon
Stones.\c"
M90060002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)During ship battles, sometimes your gunners will
lose sight of their targets. Any gunner worth
his salt will shout “Lost” when this happens.\e"
M90060003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)This often happens when your opponent gets
behind you in the heat of battle.\c"
M90060004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I heard that the Valuan Armada attacked Nasrad,
and destroyed the city!\e"
M90060005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I'll bet they burned my shop to the ground, too.
Damn Valuans!\c"
M90060006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)My shop in Nasrad is gone… destroyed in the
attack. I have no idea what I'm going to do
now…\c"
M90060007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)First, the Armada leveled Nasrad, now it looks
like they're going to destroy the rest of the
world too.\e"
M90060008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Please… I know who you are… I've heard of
tales of your bravery… I beg you. Please… stop
them. You're the only one who can.\c"
M91060000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Welcome to Nasrad, the capital of our kingdom!\e"
M91060001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)We have riches beyond your wildest dreams…
We are truly blessed by the Red Moon.
Enjoy your stay…\c"
M91060002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Your ship is able to fly beneath the clouds, I'm
sure you've seen some amazing things.\e"
M91060003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I bet there're strange creatures and sunken
ships down there, eh?\e"
M90220002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)The Nasr fleet protects our trade routes from
Black Pirates. That's why Nasr is so profitable.
Everyone trades with us, because it's safe.\c"
M90220003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)The capitol of Nasr, may have been
destroyed, but not the spirit of the Nasr
people. They've already started rebuilding.\e"
M90220004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I know that a new city will rise from the ashes
of the old.\c"
M90230000,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)If you keep heading south, you'll run into South
Ocean. Traveling through there is almost
impossible.\e"
M90230001,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)There are some really strong headwinds there…
Most ships can't handle it. It's best to
avoid that area completely.\c"
M90230002,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What?!
You're really going to try to cross South Ocean?
But, no one has ever crossed it before!!\e"
M90230003,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What is it with young people these days?
You could get killed! Well, don't say I didn't
warn you.\c"
M90230004,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)What?! You mean to tell me that you crossed
South Ocean and discovered a new continent?\e"
M90230005,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Hmm… If that's true, it might be possible to
start a new trade route through South Ocean.\c"
M90230006,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)We tried to set up a trade route with the new
continent through South Ocean, but the headwinds
were too strong.\e"
M90230007,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Trade routes have opened in North Ocean, but
that doesn't help us here in the South.\c"
M90230008,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I don't know if it has anything to do with the
appearance of that huge island, but the
skies of South Ocean are calm.\e"
M90230009,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)Once the war is over, I may be able to open up
that trade route to the new continent like I've
been wanting to.\e"
M90230010,"\h(《Nasr Merchant Ship》)I'm counting on you, Vyse! It's entirely on your
shoulders! Think of the possibilities! Think of
the money!\c"
M90150000,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I don't think I've ever seen a ship like that
around here before. I'll bet it's a Moon Stone
Trader coming to dig up Yellow Moon Stones.\e"
M90150001,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Just so you know, the Moon Stones in this area
have already been mined, so there's hardly any
left.\e"
M90150002,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Valua is trying to expand because we need to
find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"
M90150003,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Valua is trying to expand because we need to
find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"
M90150004,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Ah, protecting us from Air Pirates… Good. It's
always nice to see that the Valuan Armada is
looking out for us.\e"
M90150005,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I've heard that there's an Air Pirate named Vyse
who thinks he can outwit the Armada. I hope you
catch him!\c"
M90150006,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)It's shocking news! Lord Galcian has rebelled
against Empress Teodora!\e"
M90150007,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I, I never would have imagined that our glorious
empire would errupt into civil war! I wonder
what Lord Galcian is after…\c"
M90150008,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I couldn't believe my eyes. Moon Stones were
falling on Valua… like rain!\e"
M90150009,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)When the rain stopped, there was nothing left…
Valua has been destroyed.\c"
M90160000,\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Shhh! Hey kid… I got some Valuan arms here…\e
M90160001,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)I also buy and sell Discovery information.
I've got everything you need…\c"
M90160002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Buy and sell Discovery information.”
“Leave.”\e"
M90160003,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Valua discovered Ixa'taka several years ago and
immediately conquered it.\e"
M90160004,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Today it is a colony of Valua. The people of
Ixa'taka have been put to work as slaves in
order to get Moon Stones.\c"
M90160005,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this
region, and the Ixa'takans don't have a need for
ship parts…\e"
M90160006,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)I really don't know how much longer I'll be able
to stay in business. Maybe it's time to look for
a new line of work…\c"
M90160008,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)You've heard of Domingo, right… He's one of
the greatest explorers of our time.\e"
M90160009,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)If you're hunting for treasure in this area,
good luck. It's not easy finding anything that
Domingo hasn't already discovered.\e"
M90160010,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)Last time I saw him, he said he was searching
for the “Ixa'taka Palace.”\e"
M90160011,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this
region, and the Ixa'takans don't have a need for
ship parts…\e"
M90160012,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)I really don't know how much longer I'll be able
to stay in business. Maybe it's time to look for
a new line of work…\c"
M90160007,"\h(《Black Market Ship Parts Dealer》)I'm always flying around this area, so if you're
ever around, feel free to stop by.\c"
M90280000,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)North Ocean is a vital trade route that brings a
wealth of new goods from the new continent back
to Valua.\e"
M90280001,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Unfortunately, where there's gold to be made,
there's always pirates that want to steal it.
Be careful!\c"
M90280002,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Admirals Belleza and Vigoro took their fleets to
do battle in the west just a little while ago…\e"
M90280003,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Both fleets suffered heavy losses. I wonder what
happened to them?\c"
M90280004,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Just recently, other merchants have begun
trading with the new continent, and Valua's
losing control over the trade routes.\e"
M90280005,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I've also heard that there's dissention in
the Royal Palace, too.\c"
M90280006,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)Our capital has been destroyed. Our glorious
reign of Valuan supremacy appears to be at an
end.\c"
M90290000,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)What do you think of my new ship? Just look at
the shine on this baby! Its new engine is even
capable of punching through sky rifts.\e"
M90290001,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)With ships like this, we'll be able to establish
a trade route running from Maramba to Esparanza!\c"
M90290002,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)The other day when I was flying near the Dark
Rift, I was attacked by a creature the size of
an island.\e"
M90290003,"\h(《Valuan Merchant Ship》)I barely managed to escape with my life… I
couldn't believe how big it was… It was the
scariest thing I've ever seen!\c"
M90070000,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Your ship is very different.
Are you from the West?\e"
M90070001,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)These lands are blessed by the Green Moon.
It is called Ixa'taka.
The forest is our home.\c"
M90070002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Our people eat berries and seeds. We really like
to eat “Sky Sardis” but they are harder to
catch than berries and seeds.\e"
M90070003,\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Can you please bring me 10 “Sky Sardis?”\c
M90070004,"\h(《Vyse》)If you want “Sky Sardis,” I have 10 right
here! You can have them, if you want.\e"
M90070005,"\h(　)You give 10 “Sky Sardis” to the captain of the
ship.\e"
M90070006,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Chomp chomp chomp…
Yum! I love fish!\e"
M90070007,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)I'd eat them every day, but they're too hard to
catch.\e"
M90070008,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Thank you. I am very grateful.
Take this as a symbol of my appreciation.\e"
M90070009,\h(　)You received 1 “Abirik Cham.”\c
M90070010,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The “Sky Sardis” were very good.
But, I got a bone stuck in my throat! I guess I
ate them too fast.\c"
M90080000,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Our ships have wings, but they also need
Moon Stones for fuel.\e"
M90080001,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The Valuan ships breathe fire.
We are no match for them.\c"
M90080002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)A Great Bird spreads its wings… I once heard
this story, a long time ago.\e"
M90080003,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Somewhere near the northern lake, they say
there's a Great Bird that's visible only from
the sky.\c"
M90080004,\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The Valuans left Moon Stone Mountain.\e
M90080005,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The people that were taken hostage returned to
Horteka. I'm so glad that they're all safe.\c"
M90080006,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Many, many Valuan ships came. The ship with the
big firestick blew a hole in the western stone
reef.\e"
M90080007,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)But then, your ship appeared through that hole.
Where did you come from?\c"
M90080008,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)There's a hole at the end of the world. It's big
and scary. I'm going to stay away from it.\e"
M90080009,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The other day, I went near the hole. Another
ship came out. All of the people on it had black
hair. I was scared.\c"
M90240000,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)We've been hiding, but with the Valuans gone,
we can fly our ships again.\e"
M90240001,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)The Valuans left through the iron wall across
the northern valley and flew away. I think you
can get to Valua from there.\c"
M90240002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)Many Valuan ships came. I was afraid and hid
from them. They flew past me, to the west
of here.\e"
M90240003,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)After a while, the ships came back. There was
lots of smoke on the ships. I wonder what
happened…\c"
M90240004,"\h(《Ixa'takan Ship》)I heard a scary noise coming from the eastern
skies. I wonder what it was…\c"
M90250000,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)I live apart from the rest of the world in this
quiet place, making my home with the flowers
and the insects.\e"
M90250001,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)I'm grateful that you took the trouble to visit
me here, so let me tell you a little secret.\e"
M90250002,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a
wonderful flower called the “Balloon Flower.”
It's very beautiful.\e"
M90250003,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)You will also find a huge flock of insects that
flutter in the wind if you travel to the land
where Ixa'taka meets the Land of the Red Moon.\e"
M90250004,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)… Travel high in the sky to find
“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90250005,"\h(《Ixa'takan Hermit》)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a

“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90110000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I'm a fisherman. I've been chasing after a fish
called “Hamahai” for a long time.\e"
M90110001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)This fish called “Hamahai” is a really rare
species that's found only in the skies high
above Yafutoma.\e"
M90110002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)They fetch a great price, of course. If you have
the time, you might want to see if you can snag
some.\c"
M90120000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Who are you guys anyway? And how do you manage
to stay in the air with those steel ships of
yours?\e"
M90120001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I know who you are! You're Westerners! I've read
about people from the West, but you're the first
Westerners that I've actually seen!\e"
M90120002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Thanks to Prince Daigo, the Tenkou fleet has now
been recognized as an official part of the
Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120003,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)They don't have to stay in the ranks either.
Because they're Air Pirates, they're better at
guerilla tactics and boarding enemy ships!\c"
M90120004,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Prince Daigo already set sail towards the west
with the rest of the Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120005,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)I think Yafutoma is better off with Prince Daigo
as a Naval Commander. It was a mistake to exile
him in the first place.\c"
M90260000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Mount Kazai is our most impressive landmark. I
doubt any ships from the west would be able to
sail over it.\c"
M90260001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)What?! You're telling me that your ship can sail
over Mount Kazai?!\e"
M90260002,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Well, I'm really impressed. My compliments
to your engineers.\c"
M90270000,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)Beyond the eastern sky, there is a stone reef. I
found a hole in it, but I've been too scared to
fly close to it.\e"
M90270001,"\h(《Yafutoman Ship》)The other day, I finally got the courage to go
near it, but I saw someone in a strange-looking
ship, wearing a mask, so I flew away.\c"
M90750000,"\h(《Gordo》)There haven't been any fish around here since
that new island came out of Deep Sky.\e"
M90750001,"\h(《Gordo》)Anyone who takes food away from me will pay
dearly. Vyse, I hope you destroy them…\c"
M90750002,"\h(《Gordo》)What was that? 
You're looking for Gentum, Khale, and Kabal?\e"
M90750003,"\h(《Gordo》)I see… well, it looks like you are searching
for some exotic ingredients.\e"
M90750004,"\h(《Gordo》)Fortunately, we serve Kabal here in my
restaurant. I'd be more than happy to give
you some.\e"
M90750005,"\h(《Gordo》)It's always best to marinade it for a day or two
before cooking it… that's when all the flavors
start to come out. Good Kabal is very rare…\e"
M90750006,\h(　)You received “Kabal.”\e
M90750007,"\h(《Gordo》)Well then…
You're still looking for the other 2
ingredients, right?\e"
M90750008,"\h(《Gordo》)Hmm… It's a commonly used spice over in Nasr,
and it's easily recognizable by its scent.\e"
M90750009,"\h(《Gordo》)I'd be surprised if you couldn't find any in
Nasrad. After all, it is the largest trade city
in the world.\e"
M90750010,"\h(《Gordo》)And what else were you looking for? Ah yes…
Khale. The “Spice of Dreams” as it is sometimes
called.\e"
M90750011,"\h(《Gordo》)Not only does it spice up food, it actually
enhances the flavor of it as well.\e"
M90750012,"\h(《Gordo》)But, I have heard rumors that the last of the
Khale Trees burned down in the Valua - Nasr
War.\e"
M90750013,"\h(《Gordo》)In the Far East, there is an island that is made
up entirely of spices. If you can find that
island, you may be in luck.\c"
M90750014,"\h(《Gordo》)I think you'll be able to find “Gentum” in
Nasrad.\e"
M90750015,"\h(《Gordo》)If you're looking for “Khale”, there may be some
on Spice Island in the Far East.\c"
M90750016,"\h(《Gordo》)Well, well… I see that the information that I
gave you on Gentum and Khale was helpful.\e"
M90750017,"\h(《Gordo》)If you ever have any more questions concerning
exotic ingredients, I'll be able to help. I'm
not called the Gourmet Pirate for nothing.\c"
M90760000,"\h(《Daigo》)Well, Vyse, this is it. The rest of us will be
watching your back from up here. Go Vyse, you're
the only one that can do this.\c"
M90760001,\h(《Jao》)We pray…\e
M90760002,\h(《Mao》)… for your victory.\c
M90780002,"\h(《Centime》)Vyse, if it is okay, could you take my son,
Hans, with you?\e"
M90780003,"\h(《Centime》)He looks up to you quite a bit. And even though
he's already very skilled at engineering, I
think it would be great training for him.\e"
M90780004,"\h(《Centime》)I think it is time for him to go off on his own
and make his mark in the world.\e"
M90780005,"\h(《Hans》)Vyse, take me with you! I'll do my best to be
of service!\e"
M90780006,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Of course!”
“Sorry, but I can't take you with me.”\e"
M90780007,"\h(《Vyse》)Of course!
I could use another good engineer on my ship!\e"
M90780008,\h(《Hans》)Really? Thank you so much!\e
M90780009,\h(　)Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M90780010,"\h(《Vyse》)Sorry, but I can't take you with me.
Doesn't Centime need you to work on his ship?\e"
M90780011,"\h(《Centime》)Don't worry about me, Vyse. I'm quite an
accomplished engineer myself. I've taught him
all that I can.\e"
M90780012,"\h(《Hans》)My father has trained me well! But I know there
is probably much more that I can learn by
working on your ship! Please!\e"
M90780013,"\h(《Vyse》)I see…
Alright, then. I'll take you with me.\e"
M90780014,\h(《Hans》)Thank you so much!\e
M90780015,\h(　)Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M90780000,"\h(《Centime》)Hans… You'll have to pull your own weight on
the Delphinus… And do what Captain Vyse tells
you to do.\e"
M90780001,"\h(《Hans》)Sure, Dad. You've taught me well, and I always
follow orders. I'll do everything I can to help
Captain Vyse.\c"
M90770000,"\h(《Gilder's Vice Captain》)Captain Gilder! You can leave the Claudia with
us! We'll take care of her!\e"
M90770001,"\h(《Willy》)Leave it to us! Wrrack!
Leave it to us!\c"
M90790000,"\h(《Clara》)Oh, Gilder… promise me… promise me that you'll
come back. I'll be waiting right here.\e"
M90790001,"\h(《Clara》)We will always be together. We'll watch the
sunset when you get back. It'll be so romantic.
You're such a dreamboat. My ring size is…\e"
M90790002,"\h(《Clara》)Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! What am I
saying!? Gilder, we can discuss this later…
Hurry back!\c"
M90790003,"\h(《Clara》)Oh, Gilder… promise me, promise me that you'll
come back to me!\e"
M91160000,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, on the Albatross, you always did your
best. You were always the first to board an
enemy ship, and nobody could stop you.\e"
M91160001,"\h(《Dyne》)I've always been proud of you. Maybe there were
times when I didn't show it, but I've never been
disappointed in you.\e"
M91160002,"\h(《Dyne》)Now, this is it. We've got the enemy cornered.
Don't give up, Vyse! I know you can do it!\c"
M92000000,"\h(《Baltor》)Don't you dare get yourself killed, now, Vyse!
Understand?! I want you to know I won't stand
for it!\e"
M92000001,"\h(《Baltor》)I'll kill you if you die fighting with those
clowns. Got that?! I'm the one who gets to kill
you! Me!\c"
M09902000,"\h(《Aika》)Visibility is horrible!
Vyse, the fog's too thick!
I can barely see!\e"
M09902001,"\h(《Vyse》)That's strange… there's never any fog in this
region… I wonder what's causing it.\e"
M09902002,"\h(《Vyse》)The only way to get to Valua is through here…
Slow to half speed…\e"
M09902003,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, wait… we're too close to that island
over there!\e"
M09903000,"\h(《Dyne》)Hey, you're going the wrong way.
There's nothing but open sky over there.\e"
M09903001,"\h(《Dyne》)Turn around and head back to Pirate Isle. This
is no time for you to be fooling around.\c"
M09903002,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, Vyse! You're heading the wrong way! Did you
forget how to read a compass or something?\e"
M09903003,"\h(《Aika》)Shrine Island is to the southwest of here!
That's when the little needle thingy is between
the “S” and the “W.”\c"
M09903004,"\h(《Aika》)Where are you going? We need to get back home to
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909900,"\h(《Dyne》)This is Shrine Island. Some people say that it's
some kind of ancient temple, others think it's
haunted.\e"
M09909901,"\h(《Dyne》)We don't have time to go sight-seeing. Turn the
ship around and head back to Pirate Isle.\c"
M09904000,"\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)Beyond this point is the Valuan Empire. Show me
your entry passport.\e"
M09904001,"\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)What?! You don't have a passport?! I cannot
allow you to go beyond this point! Go back to
the pit you crawled out of!\c"
M09904002,"\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)Beyond this point is the Valuan Empire. Show me
your entry passport.\e"
M09904003,"\h(《Vyse》)A passport? I've got one right here. Take your
time looking it over.\e"
M09904004,\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)… Hmm. Very well.\e
M09904005,\h(《Valuan Patrol Ship》)You may proceed.\c
M09906000,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M09906001,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M09906002,"\h(《Nasr Air Guard》)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M09908000,"\h(《Drachma》)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908001,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully made it
through there.\e"
M09908002,"\h(《Vyse》)Wow…
Sounds like fun. Let's give it a shot.\e"
M09908003,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot! Don't take it so lightly! If it was that
easy, I wouldn't be warnin' you like this!\e"
M09908004,"\h(《Drachma》)Small ships are torn apart by the fierce winds.
Even large ships need considerable power to just
move forward.\e"
M09908005,"\h(《Drachma》)The Little Jack's engine isn't strong enough to
get through here. We must turn back.\c"
M09908006,"\h(《Drachma》)This is South Ocean, boy. I thought I told you
that we'd never make it through there alive.
Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908007,"\h(《Bellena》)The area before you is called South Ocean. I'd
turn back if I were you.\e"
M09908008,"\h(《Bellena》)There's a strong wind that blows from the west
here. This place is known among sailors as one
of the most difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908009,"\h(《Bellena》)Nobody has ever made it through this place. And
nobody knows what lies on the other side,
either.\e"
M09908010,"\h(《Aika》)Wow…
I suppose we'd never make it through in this
tiny ship.\e"
M09908011,"\h(《Bellena》)This ship would probably be torn apart instantly
in the fierce winds.\e"
M09908012,"\h(《Bellena》)We would need a much, much more powerful engine
even to have a chance of making it through
there.\e"
M09908013,"\h(《Aika》)You're probably right. And besides… we should
be looking for the Red Moon Crystal right now,
anyway. Alright Vyse! Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908014,"\h(《Bellena》)I told you that this is South Ocean. We'd never
make it through there. Turn the boat around.\c"
M09908015,"\h(《Drachma》)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908016,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully sailed
through it.\e"
M09908017,"\h(《Vyse》)But the lands of the Green Moon are through
here, right?\e"
M09908018,"\h(《Vyse》)And besides, we have Belleza's engine now.
It's not like we don't have a chance of making
it through.\e"
M09908019,"\h(《Drachma》)Hmm…
Perhaps. But my knowledge of this place is
limited. You're on your own, boy.\e"
M09908020,"\h(《Drachma》)This isn't goin' to be an easy journey. Prepare
yourselves for the worst, kids.\c"
M09909910,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse! This is it! This is where the Red Moon
Crystal is buried!\e"
M09909911,"\h(《Vyse》)Great! Let's land this ship and search the place
right away!\e"
M09909912,\h(《Drachma》)……\e
M09909913,"\h(《Drachma》)… Wait, boy.
Head to town first. I've got some things that I
need to take care of.\e"
M09909914,"\h(《Drachma》)There's a port city named Maramba near here.
Go there first, got it?\e"
M09909915,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… sure. No problem. I just thought that we
could… um… never mind. It doesn't matter to
me.\c"
M09909916,"\h(《Drachma》)You can explore the temple later. Head to
Maramba first, boy.\c"
M09901100,"\h(《Drachma》)Hrumph…
So this is the Iron Net. I've heard rumors about
it.\e"
M09901101,"\h(《Drachma》)I heard that the Valuans built this to prevent
people from coming here from North Ocean.\e"
M09901102,"\h(《Drachma》)I guess they didn't want anyone to find out
about this new land.\e"
M09901103,"\h(《Aika》)I hate to say this, but I don't think we're
going to be able to break through that thing.
We should turn back.\c"
M09901104,"\h(《Drachma》)We'll never be able to break through the Iron
Net, boy. Turn this boat around.\c"
M09909920,"\h(《High Priest》)Did you people come from the east?
Then I have nothing to talk to you about.
Go back to where you came from!\c"
M09909930,"\h(《Drachma》)This looks like the Valuan headquarters here
in these parts.\e"
M09909931,"\h(《Drachma》)Who knows what will happen if we just go
wanderin' around in there. We shouldn't get too
close, boy.\c"
M09901400,"\h(《Drachma》)What are you doin', boy?! Are you tryin' to
leave Valua?!\e"
M09901401,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah! Aren't we supposed to be looking for the
Yellow Crystal around here? Turn this boat
around Vyse!\c"
M09901402,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901403,"\h(《Drachma》)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09901500,"\h(《Gilder》)Hey, hey! Where do you think you're going, Vyse?
That's Valuan homeland over there!\e"
M09901501,"\h(《Gilder》)Don't you think we have better things to do
than to pick another fight with the Valuans?
We should probably avoid this area.\c"
M09901502,"\h(《Aika》)Wait a second there, Fina. Isn't that Valua up
ahead?\e"
M09901503,"\h(《Aika》)What are we going to do with this little boat if
the Valuans decide to attack us? We probably
should stay out of there for now.\c"
M09901600,"\h(《Drachma》)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"

this boat around right now!!\c"
M09909940,"\h(《Aika》)Hey! Look over there! There's some kind of
vortex! Maybe we can go inside it!\e"
M09909941,"\h(《Enrique》)Ugh… Per… Perhaps we should head over to…
ugh… Esparanza, first…\e"
M09909942,"\h(《Enrique》)I don't know… how much longer I can take…
this before I… ulp!\e"
M09909943,"\h(《Aika》)Heh… I swear… What are we going to do with
you, Enrique? I suppose we have no choice for
now. Vyse, let's head over to Esparanza!\c"
M09909944,"\h(《Enrique》)Ugh…
Please… can't we just… stop by Esparanza
first? I'm begging you… ulp!\c"
M09909945,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like we can get inside the Dark Rift
through here. Enrique, are you ready?\e"
M09909946,"\h(《Enrique》)… Yes, I'm ready. I don't suppose I have much
of a choice at this point. We must get through
the Dark Rift no matter what.\e"
M09909947,"\h(《Enrique》)Don't mind me… I will be fine. This is neither
the time nor the place to be complaining about
airsickness.\c"
M09902400,"\h(《Gilder》)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09902401,"\h(《Gilder》)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09902402,"\h(《Fina》)Aika… It looks like we've gone a little too far
to the north.\e"
M09902403,"\h(《Aika》)I think you're right.
Who knows what's up ahead. It might be a little
dangerous to go exploring right now.\e"
M09902404,"\h(《Aika》)And from what I can tell of the map, Daccat's
Island probably isn't north of here anyway.
Let's turn around and continue searching.\c"
M09909952,"\h(《Gilder》)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"

trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09909950,"\h(《Enrique》)Vyse… do not return to Crescent Isle. I beg of
you.\e"
M09909951,"\h(《Enrique》)If I go back now… I… I'm afraid that my
determination will falter. I cannot allow myself
to do that…\c"
M09909960,"\h(《Vyse》)What's this?
There's something set into the statue's eye
socket…\e"
M09909961,\h(　)You found the “Golden Man's Eye.”\e
M09909962,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, no one will notice if it's missing, right?
And besides… we're Air Pirates!! Can you really
blame us for taking a little bit of treasure?\c"
M09909963,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm? Hey, Aika… do you see something glittering
on the ground? Right where the eye of that bird
would be…\e"
M09909964,"\h(《Aika》)Hey, you're right! Let me go down and see what
it is…\e"
M09909965,"\h(《Aika》)… Hey, Vyse! I found something! There was a gem
stuck into the ground! I'm sure they won't miss
a little, itty-bitty gem, would they?\e"
M09909966,\h(　)You found the “Great Bird's Eye.”\e
M09909967,"\h(《Aika》)Besides, who knows when a nice little gem like
this will come in handy?\c"
M09909968,"\h(《Fina》)I…
I can't believe that they actually used the
Rains of Destruction…\e"
M09909969,\h(《Aika》)Fina…\e
M09909970,"\h(《Gilder》)… Vyse, maybe we should head back to Crescent
Isle and take a minute to regroup. We can't do
anything to get into Soltis right now, anyway.\e"
M09909971,"\h(《Vyse》)… You're right.
I really hate to do this, but it looks like we
have no choice but to just head home for now.\c"
M09909972,"\h(《Vyse》)There's an incredibly strong wind blowing from
inside the Dark Rift.\e"
M09909973,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like it's going to be tough to get
through there even with the Delphinus…\c"
M09909974,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm… It looks like we've come out of the Dark
Rift on the same side that we went in on.\c"
M09909975,"\h(《Aika》)On the treasure map it says, “The dead will
always watch over my treasure.”\e"
M09909976,"\h(《Aika》)And there's a skull here on the eastern part of
the Valuan continent. I wonder if that has to
do with anything…\c"
M09909977,"\h(《Vyse》)… What's this place? Why are there buildings
being built on an island way down here?!\c"
M09909994,"\h(《Vyse》)It's too dangerous to go back there right now.
And, besides… I shouldn't let Gregorio's
sacrifice be in vain.\c"
M09909995,"\h(《Aika》)This is the Armada's homebase. We probably
shouldn't get too close, or we'll be asking for
trouble. Let's just turn the ship around…\c"
M09909978,"\h(《Aika》)We did it!!
We actually made it through the Dark Rift!!\e"
M09909979,"\h(《Enrique》)Well! I can't believe that we are actually going
to be able to see what lies east of the Dark
Rift! We're making history as we speak!\c"
M09909980,"\h(《Aika》)Wow! There are so many herbs and spices growing
here! I've never seen so many in one place
before!\e"
M09909981,"\h(《Vyse》)It's amazing… This place truly is a treasure
island.\e"
M09909982,"\h(《Fina》)But we really shouldn't disturb the island too
much…\e"
M09909983,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah… I suppose that if we took too many of the
seeds and stuff that the trees might not be able
to grow back.\e"
M09909984,"\h(《Aika》)… But, I'm sure it would be okay just to take a
little bit, right Vyse?\e"
M09909985,"\h(《Vyse》)I swear, Aika. You and your “just a little bit.”
Alright, alright… we'll take something with us.\e"
M09909986,\h(　)You received the spice “Khale.”\e
M09909987,"\h(《Drachma》)King Ixa'taka spoke of an Iron Net to the north
of this continent.\e"
M09909988,"\h(《Aika》)Yeah… But, if the Valuans escaped to the north,
that means they probably had to take down the
Iron Net, right?\e"
M09909989,"\h(《Drachma》)That means we'll be able to reach North Ocean
that way. We'll head straight to Valua from
there.\c"
M09909990,"\h(《Enrique》)In truth, the Delphinus has not yet been
completed.\e"
M09909991,"\h(《Enrique》)The hull hasn't been fully reinforced yet, so it
would probably be impossible to fly through
stone reefs at this point.\e"
M09909992,"\h(《Enrique》)And the engine's output settings haven't been
properly adjusted yet either, so we probably
won't be able fly through sky rifts.\e"
M09909993,"\h(《Engine》)However, if we can find some way to fix the hull
and the engine, I'm sure sky rifts and stone
reefs would pose no problem for this ship.\e"
M09909000,\h(《Dyne》)Wait… that's the legendary “Pirate's Grave!”\e
M09909001,"\h(《Briggs the Vice Captain》)Good job, Vyse! I'm sure that the Sailors' Guild
would be more than happy to pay you for making
this Discovery!\e"
M09909002,"\h(《Vyse》)Guild?
Pay me for a Discovery?\e"
M09909003,"\h(《Dyne》)Much of this world is uncharted and shrouded
in legend. Ruins, strange creatures… all
sorts of things are waiting to be discovered.\e"
M09909004,"\h(《Dyne》)Any major port city will have a Sailors' Guild.
They pay explorers well for any information on
Discoveries that they've made.\e"
M09909005,"\h(《Dyne》)When you're flying through the skies and your
compass starts spinning around rapidly, that
means there's a Discovery nearby.\e"
M09909006,"\h(《Dyne》)If you try searching the area, you'll probably
find a Discovery. Just head over to the Sailors'
Guild afterwards and collect your reward.\e"
M09909007,"\h(《Dyne》)But, the longer you wait, the greater the chance
that someone else will beat you to it. So, you
should visit the Guild as soon as you can, okay?\c"
M09909008,"\h(《Dyne》)Vyse, before we set sail, do you have any
questions that you wanted to ask me?\e"
M09909009,"\h(《What will you say?》)“How do I steer this thing?”
“How do we get home from here?”
“No, not really.”\e"
M09909010,"\h(《Vyse》)Just to be safe, how exactly do I steer this
thing?\e"
M09909011,"\h(《Dyne》)I never thought I'd hear you ask something like
that. Heh… Nevertheless, pay close attention.\e"
M09909012,"\h(《Dyne》)Using the analog stick, you can move forward or
backward, and turn left or right.\e"
M09909013,"\h(《Dyne》)You can control your altitude by using the R and
L triggers. The R trigger will move the ship
upward and the L trigger will do the opposite.\e"
M09909014,"\h(《Dyne》)Whenever you want to search anything or whenever
you want to dock at a harbor, just press the
A button.\e"
M09909015,"\h(《Vyse》)Um… don't laugh at me, Dad… er… Captain, but
I don't remember the way home from here. Could
you tell me where to go?\e"
M09909016,"\h(《Dyne》)How do you expect to become a good sailor if you
don't pay attention to where you are?! Just head
southeast from here.\e"
M09909017,"\h(《Dyne》)You'll recognize the island when you see it…
hopefully. If you get lost, you can look at a
map using the Start button.\e"
M09909018,"\h(《Dyne》)Also, you'll run into monsters on occasion as
you're sailing. If you do, run out to the deck
and take 'em out.\e"
M09909019,"\h(《Dyne》)One word of warning: there are these monsters
called Maroccas that live around here. They're
pretty tough.\e"
M09909020,"\h(《Dyne》)If you're not doing much damage on your enemy,
try hitting the Y button to change the
properties of your weapon. It might work better.\c"
M09909021,"\h(《Dyne》)Well, then! Full speed ahead! Destination,
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909022,"\h(《Drachma》)That reminds me… you should have received
something called a “Captain's Stripe.”\e"
M09909023,"\h(《Drachma》)You'll receive one for every major battle that
you win. It's sort of like a trophy.\e"
M09909024,"\h(《Drachma》)If you “Use” a Captain's Stripe, it will make
your ship stronger.\e"
M09909025,"\h(《Vyse》)I see. Thanks for the advice, Captain.\c"
M09909026,"\h(《Drachma》)It looks like we picked up a “Magic Cannon” from
the lady admiral.\e"
M09909027,"\h(《Drachma》)Using this, we'll be able to fire cannonballs
charged with magical energy.\e"
M09909028,"\h(《Aika》)Just like Belleza was doing, right? That's
great! Vyse! Did you hear that?! We should
really put this thing to good use!\e"
M09909029,"\h(《Drachma》)Be careful though, boy. Using the Magic Cannon
uses up MP just like normal magic. So don't go
too crazy with it.\c"
