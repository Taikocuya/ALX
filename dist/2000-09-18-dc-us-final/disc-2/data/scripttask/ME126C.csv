MJ0050000,\h(《Vyse》)What's this? It looks like plans to a ship…\e
MJ0050001,"\h(《Aika》)These must be the plans for the ship that Gilder
was talking about.\e"
MJ0050002,"\h(《Fina》)I think you're right, Aika.\e"
MJ0050003,"\h(《Vyse》)All the specs… from the hull to the engine… 
they're all written here!\e"
MJ0050004,"\h(《Enrique》)This ship is Admiral De Loco's ship, 
the Chameleon.\e"
MJ0050005,"\h(《Enrique》)It appears that his ship is being modified 
according to these plans.\e"
MJ0050006,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, now that we have this, we might 
be able to get to Deep Sky.\e"
MJ0050007,"\h(《Vyse》)We've gotten what we came here for!
Let's get out of here!\e"
MJ0050008,"\h(《De Loco》)Hehehe…
We are currently strengthening the walls of the
bridge…\e"
MJ0050009,"\h(《Galcian》)Increase the speed of the construction.
Finish it within the week.\e"
MJ0050010,\h(《Galcian》)…Hmm.\e
MJ0050011,"\h(《Galcian》)Heh…
Well well well… what do we have here?\e"
MJ0050012,"\h(《Galcian》)This time, I will be sure to dispose of you all
permanently.\e"
MJ0050013,\h(　)You received the “Ship Schematics.”\e
M01260000,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260001,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Moon Energy System operating within normal
parameters. Power supply to the entire base
is flowing smoothly.\e"
M01260002,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Okay, the inspection for this area is done.
Let's go to the next one.\e"
M01260003,"\h(《Vyse》)(I think that's the control area
for the base's power.)\c"
M01260004,"\h(《Vyse》)(I think that's the control area
for the base's power.)\c"
M01260005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a fan. It's probably for ventilation.
I don't think I should get too close…\e"
M01260006,"\h(《Vyse》)But, it looks like there's a passageway behind
it. Hmm… I wonder if there's a way to stop the
fan…\c"
M01260007,"\h(《Vyse》)Whoa, now that's scary…
This must be an elevator shaft.\c"
M01260008,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm, it won't open…
It's probably locked or barred from the
other side.\c"
M01260009,"\h(《Enrique》)Gregorio!
Gregorio!!\e"
M01260010,"\h(《Vyse》)It's no use…
It's locked from
the other side.\c"
M01260011,"\h(《Galcian》)Stop, Air Pirate!\e"
M01260012,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260013,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)So, these are the schematics that Lord De Loco
designed. With his new design, his ship is
supposed to be able to fly into Deep Sky?\e"
M01260014,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)That's what I hear. But it's not like I
can understand any of it anyway. It all looks
like scribbles to me.\c"
M01260015,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Well, I heard that Lord De Loco was going to
take Lord Galcian to take a look around the
Chameleon today…\c"
M01260016,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)What!? If they see us slacking off
here we're done for! Let's get out of here!\c"
M01260017,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
M01260018,"\h(《Vyse》)It's no use…
It's locked from
the other side.\e"
M01260019,"\h(《Vyse》)We can't let Gregorio's sacrifice be in vain!
We need to get out of here now!!\c"
M01260020,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn! It won't open!
Something's holding the door shut!\e"
M01260021,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, we don't have time!
Let's get out of here!!\c"
M01260022,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260023,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I still don't get why they would build a base
down here. What's the point? There's nothing
down here other than wind.\e"
M01260024,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I hear they're trying to build
an elevator that goes all the way into
Deep Sky…\e"
M01260025,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)D, Deep Sky?!
My mom told me when I was a kid that Deep Sky
is the land of the dead!!\c"
M01260026,"\h(《Valuan Solider》)An elevator that goes into Deep Sky?
Unbelievable…\c"
M01260027,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Intruders!!
Get them!!\c"
M01260028,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260029,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Hey, did you hear?
Lord Galcian is building a new
top-secret flagship.\c"
M01260030,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)It'll probably be even more powerful than his
old ship, the Serpent. I swear… that Lord
Galcian really is something.\e"
M01260031,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Did you know that Lord Galcian has never been
defeated in battle? He's a military genius!\c"
M01260032,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)As long as Lord Galcian is around to lead us,
we'll be fine. I doubt there's anyone who could
defeat him.\c"
M01260033,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)You… you're Vyse!?
What are you doing here!?\c"
M01260034,"\h(《Would you like to try again?》)“I never give up!”
“I quit.”\c"
