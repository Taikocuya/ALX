MA0180000,"\h(《Lindsi》)Vy~se!
Ai~ka!
Good Luck!\e"
MA0180001,"\h(《Alan》)You'd better come back!
Promise me, okay?\e"
MA0180002,"\h(《Aika》)Of course! Don't worry…
We'll come back with everyone else, too!\e"
MA0180003,"\h(《Vyse》)Alright…
Aika, let's go.\e"
MA0180004,"\h(《Aika》)Aye aye.
Valua should be on a landmass due north from
here.\e"
MA0180005,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm setting the course!
Alright… Valua, here we come!\e"
M00010000,"\h(《Jimmy》)Don't worry about us, Vyse! We'll take care
of everything while you're gone!\e"
M00010001,"\h(《Jimmy》)My injury? It's all better! My dad always told
me that anything that doesn't kill you will hurt
at first, but it will only make you stronger!\c"
M00020000,"\h(《Alan》)I'm gonna try and fix everything! You
just watch! You don't have to worry
about anything, okay Vyse?\e"
M00020001,"\h(《Alan》)We're not little babies anymore! I was a little
scared at first, but we've got to learn to take
care of things around here, too!\c"
M00030000,\h(《Lindsi》)Vyse… Just promise me one thing…\e
M00030001,"\h(《Lindsi》)You have to promise me that you'll come
back safely, no matter what! Okay? Promise?\e"
M00030002,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Sure, I promise.”
“Sorry… I can't promise anything.”\e"
M00030003,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure, I promise. Have I ever not come home
safely? Have I ever let you down, Lindsi?\e"
M00030004,"\h(《Lindsi》)N, no… You've always come home to us…\e"
M00030005,"\h(《Vyse》)You see? So you don't need to worry.
So, don't worry… I'll come back safely.
And I'll bring back everyone with me.\e"
M00030006,"\h(《Lindsi》)Okay! It's a promise then! We'll all be
waiting for you!! Come home soon!\c"
M00030007,"\h(《Vyse》)To be perfectly honest… I can't really say.
I mean, I've never even been to Valua before…
I don't know what lies ahead.\e"
M00030008,"\h(《Lindsi》)No, don't say that! You have to come home!
You just have to!!!\e"
M00030009,"\h(《Vyse》)… I'll try my best, Lindsi. I'll try my best.\e"
M00030010,"\h(《Lindsi》)You better come back! Or else I'm gonna have to
go out and bring you back, okay?!\c"
M00030011,"\h(《Lindsi》)You have to promise to come back home with
everyone else, okay? It's a promise!\c"
M00030012,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow!\e
M00030013,"\h(《Vyse》)Okay, Pow, I have to go away for a little
while… You be a good boy and look after
everyone while I'm away, alright?\e"
M00040000,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow! Pow!!\c
M00040001,\h(《Pow》)Pow pow! Pow!!\c
M00080000,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Good morning, dear. Are you all set to go?
I… I almost don't want you to go…
But, I suppose you must.\e"
M00080001,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Stand tall, my son. When a sailor starts out on
a journey, he needs to go with a little more
hope in his eyes than that, okay?\e"
M00080002,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)We'll be fine here on the island, so don't worry
about a thing. You just make sure and bring your
father home safe and sound. Good luck, my dear…\c"
M00080003,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)Vyse, why don't you take a little rest? You
must be very tired. A little nap can work
wonders sometimes…\e"
M00080004,"\h(《What will you say?》)“Sure, I could use a little rest.”
“Nah… I'll be fine. I'm not that tired.”\e"
M00080005,"\h(《Vyse》)Sure, I could use a little rest. I was starting
to get a little tired…\e"
M00080006,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)No problem.
Sleep well, Vyse.\e"
M00080007,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)It looks like you rested well.
Be careful out there, okay?\c"
M00080008,"\h(《Vyse》)I'll be fine, mom. I'm not that tired.\e"
M00080009,"\h(《Vyse's Mother》)I see. Well, just be careful out there, okay?\c"
M00090000,"\h(《Jessica》)This scarf… I was knitting it for my husband,
Patch, before… before the Valuans took him.\e"
M00090001,"\h(《Jessica》)No… I must keep knitting. I must finish it.
Then I will give it to my husband when he
returns. I know he'll be back… I just know it…\c"
M00100000,"\h(《Granny》)Your father and everyone else tried to make
me run and hide underground, but I refused to.\e"
M00100001,"\h(《Granny》)Call me a stubborn old woman if you want, but
when I die, I want to die in my own home.\e"
M00100002,"\h(《Granny》)But… I didn't die. And all the young men were
captured… Oh, Vyse, I'm so glad you're safe,
though. It's all so horrible… so horrible…\c"
M00100003,"\h(《Granny》)We just have to think of it as a test that the
Moons are putting us through. They are testing
our bonds of love and friendship…\c"
M00100004,"\h(《Granny》)Vyse… Aika… You both are going after Dyne and
the others? I pray that the Moons watch over
you, wherever you may go…\c"
M00160000,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)V, Vyse, is that you? We got hit badly
by the Valuans… by the Armada…\e"
M00160001,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)… They just attacked us out of nowhere…
I barely had time to warn the others…
Everything's been destroyed…\e"
M00160002,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)The women and children took refuge underground,
but the Captain and the others… they were all
captured and taken prisoner…\c"
M00160003,"\h(《Ben the Lookout》)Everyone else is… in the underground docks…
Hurry and go to them… Your mother was
worried sick…\c"
Ms002b000,"\h(《Vyse》)I can't believe it…
Everything is burnt to a crisp…\c"
Ms002b001,"\h(《Vyse》)Even the walls are falling apart. It's going to
take a lot of work to fix this place again.\c"
Ms002b002,"\h(《Vyse》)The spear that was hanging here has been reduced
to almost nothing but ashes.\c"
Ms002b003,"\h(《Vyse》)This pillar used to never budge, no matter how
hard you hit it. Now it's ready to fall over…\c"
Ms002b004,"\h(《Vyse》)The plant that Granny was raising has fallen off
of her dresser. She put so much love into
raising that thing… She must be heart-broken.\c"
Ms002b005,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, at least the salted fish is safe…\c"
Ms002b006,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like someone was in the middle of
cooking and just left this pot here when the
attack started.\c"
Ms002b007,"\h(《Vyse》)Granny's pot is still full of food. She was
probably cooking when the Valuans attacked. I
hope she's had something to eat since then…\c"
Ms002b008,"\h(《Vyse》)The glass has been shattered and shards are
scattered everywhere. Even the utensils that
were inside the drawer are all scattered around.\c"
Ms002b009,"\h(《Vyse》)The water inside has been polluted with ashes
and dust. This water is unusable now…\c"
Ms002b010,\h(《Vyse》)It's filled with water all the way to the brim.\c
Ms002b011,"\h(《Vyse》)The pickled turnips look and smell as good as
ever… Well, they look and smell as good as
pickled turnips can get, I suppose.\c"
Ms002b012,"\h(《Vyse》)The glass has been shattered and shards are
scattered everywhere. Even the utensils that
were inside the drawer are all scattered around.\c"
Ms002b013,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like someone was in the middle of
cooking and just left this pot here when the
attack started.\c"
Ms002b014,"\h(《Vyse》)Someone left the pot on the fire. There isn't
a whole lot cooking inside the pot, either…\c"
Ms002b015,"\h(《Vyse》)The water inside has been polluted with ashes
and dust. This water is unusable now…\c"
Ms002b016,\h(《Vyse》)It's filled with water all the way to the brim.\c
Ms002b017,"\h(《Vyse》)The dresser seems to have survived intact. It
doesn't look like the contents have been
disturbed, either.\c"
Ms002b018,"\h(《Vyse》)It's my old man's bed. It looks like it wasn't
damaged by the attack.\c"
Ms002b019,"\h(《Vyse》)The fireplace is cold… I don't know when the
last time this fireplace was ever cold. Mom
rarely ever lets the fire go out…\c"
Ms002b020,"\h(《Vyse》)Mom almost never lets the fire go out… I don't
know why, but it's almost depressing…\c"
Ms002b021,"\h(《Vyse》)The glass has been shattered and shards are
scattered everywhere. Even the utensils that
were inside the drawer are all scattered around.\c"
Ms002b022,"\h(《Vyse》)I don't think I could relax right now, even if
I tried. I'd just be wasting my time if I were
to try and lie down in bed.\c"
Ms002b023,"\h(《Vyse》)Whew… My book on navigation wasn't burnt in the
fires. It's covered in ashes, but at least it's
okay.\c"
Ms002b024,"\h(《Vyse》)These papers must've been scattered in the
attack. No wait… I left these papers out here.
Oops.\c"
Ms002b025,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh man… The sign that used to say “Windmill
Island” is broken.\c"
Ms002b026,"\h(《Vyse》)Oh man… The sign that used to say “Windmill
Island” is broken.\e"
Ms002b027,"\h(《Vyse》)Well, I suppose now that the Valuans know that
it was just a cover-up, there's no point in
calling this place Windmill Island anymore.\c"
Ms002b028,"\h(《Vyse》)This is probably from a cannon blast. Even the
ground is scorched here… Those Valuans are
going to pay…\c"
Ms002b029,"\h(《Vyse》)It's hard to think that just before we left for
Shrine Island that there was laundry hanging up
to dry as usual here…\c"
Ms002b030,"\h(《Vyse》)Even the garden looks like it was hit. I don't
think any of the turnips survived the attack.\c"
Ms002b031,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn… It's stuck. It was probably jammed shut
by the attack.\c"
Ms002b032,"\h(《Vyse》)The door is jammed. It looks like it was bent
out of shape in the attack.\e"
Ms002b033,"\h(《Vyse》)This windmill was sort of like the symbol of
this island. And now it's nearly in ruins…\c"
Ms002b034,"\h(《Vyse》)The ladder was destroyed in the attack. There's
no way we can make it up to Lookout Island right
now.\c"
Ms002b035,"\h(《Vyse》)A big chunk of rock is blocking the door to
Aika's house. An explosion from one of the
cannon blasts probably did this.\c"
Ms002b036,"\h(《Vyse》)This boulder's huge! The Valuans must have
really strong cannons to have caused something
like this to fly so far.\c"
Ms002b037,"\h(《Vyse》)It's no use. I can't move this boulder… It's
way too heavy.\c"
Ms002b038,"\h(《Vyse》)… I can't go any further. Everything was
destroyed beyond here.\c"
Ms002b039,"\h(《Vyse》)This is no time for me to go out sailing. I have
to check up on everyone to make sure they're
okay!\c"
Ms002b040,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Set sail for Valua.”
“Stay a little while longer.”\c"
