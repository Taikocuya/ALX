MJ0060000,"\h(《Galcian》)Well, Vyse…\e"
MJ0060001,\h(《Galcian》)It looks like we meet again.\e
MJ0060002,\h(《Vyse》)Galcian!\e
MJ0060003,"\h(《Galcian》)Heh… Not only once, but twice, you escaped from
the Grand Fortress. Very impressive.\e"
MJ0060004,"\h(《Galcian》)However… do not think you will escape 
a third time.\e"
MJ0060005,"\h(《Enrique》)Galcian…
What is Valua planning to do by building
a place like this?\e"
MJ0060006,"\h(《Galcian》)If it isn't the Little Prince…
Whatever Valua does, Your Highness, is no longer
any of your concern, if I'm not mistaken.\e"
MJ0060007,"\h(《Galcian》)You were the one who threw away your
responsibilities and sided with these… pirates.\e"
MJ0060008,"\h(《Enrique》)I did not throw away my responsibilities! 
I am working to rebuild the Empire!\e"
MJ0060009,"\h(《Galcian》)Heh heh heh… It matters not to me.
I have no interest in Valua anymore.\e"
MJ0060010,"\h(《Galcian》)I shall dispose of you here, once and for all.\e"
MJ0060011,\h(《Enrique》)…\e
MJ0060012,"\h(《Vyse》)This is great…
Of all people to get caught by…\e"
MJ0060013,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!
Behind you!\e"
MJ0060014,"\h(《Gregorio》)It has been a while, Prince Enrique.\e"
MJ0060015,\h(《Enrique》)Gregorio?!!\e
MJ0060016,"\h(《Enrique》)How ironic… that fate has lead us both here to
pit sword against sword with each other.\e"
MJ0060017,"\h(《Gregorio》)Do not worry.
I am not here to fight you.\e"
MJ0060018,\h(《Enrique》)What? What are you doing?!\e
MJ0060019,"\h(《Galcian》)Gregorio…
You understand the consequences of your
actions…\e"
MJ0060020,"\h(《Gregorio》)Lord Galcian…
It appears that YOU do not understand the
consequences of YOUR actions.\e"
MJ0060021,"\h(《Gregorio》)You wish to revive the ancient horrors and use
them to make the world yours…\e"
MJ0060022,"\h(《Gregorio》)I cannot sit back and watch you destroy the
world!\e"
MJ0060023,\h(《Enrique》)What are you doing?\e
MJ0060024,"\h(《Gregorio》)Prince… you spoke the truth when we last met 
at Esparanza. The Empire has chosen 
the wrong path.\e"
MJ0060025,"\h(《Gregorio》)You and Vyse are the only ones that can stop the
Armada.\e"
MJ0060026,"\h(《Gregorio》)Prince Enrique… 
Let my last act be in your honor.\e"
MJ0060027,\h(《Enrique》)Why?\e
MJ0060028,"\h(《Gregorio》)I will hold him off.
Escape while you can.\e"
MJ0060029,"\h(《Enrique》)What are you saying?!
We will fight with you!\e"
MJ0060030,"\h(《Gregorio》)You must not take Galcian lightly! 
He is more powerful than you can imagine.\e"
MJ0060031,"\h(《Gregorio》)And this is a military base of the Armada… 
If you don't escape soon, we will all be
surrounded.\e"
MJ0060032,\h(《Gregorio》)If you die here… the world will be doomed.\e
MJ0060033,"\h(《Gregorio》)Go… our last hopes lie with you… 
Young Prince.\e"
MJ0060034,"\h(《Gregorio》)I earned the nickname Iron Wall Admiral.
I won't let him past me.\e"
MJ0060035,"\h(《Gregorio》)And, I will be able to die defending you.
I cannot ask for a higher honor.\e"
MJ0060036,\h(《Enrique》)Wait! Don't do this!!!\e
MJ0060037,"\h(《Gregorio》)Young Prince… Captain Vyse…
Please… You must stop Galcian… 
You are our last hope…\e"
MJ0060038,\h(《Gregorio》)Farewell!\e
MJ0060039,\h(《Enrique》)NOOO!!!\e
MJ0060040,"\h(《Galcian》)Gregorio…
Have you made your peace?\e"
MJ0060041,"\h(《Gregorio》)I am ready to die, Lord Galcian, but I shall die
defending my people against a tyrant.\e"
M01260000,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260001,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Moon Energy System operating within normal
parameters. Power supply to the entire base
is flowing smoothly.\e"
M01260002,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Okay, the inspection for this area is done.
Let's go to the next one.\e"
M01260003,"\h(《Vyse》)(I think that's the control area
for the base's power.)\c"
M01260004,"\h(《Vyse》)(I think that's the control area
for the base's power.)\c"
M01260005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a fan. It's probably for ventilation.
I don't think I should get too close…\e"
M01260006,"\h(《Vyse》)But, it looks like there's a passageway behind
it. Hmm… I wonder if there's a way to stop the
fan…\c"
M01260007,"\h(《Vyse》)Whoa, now that's scary…
This must be an elevator shaft.\c"
M01260008,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm, it won't open…
It's probably locked or barred from the
other side.\c"
M01260009,"\h(《Enrique》)Gregorio!
Gregorio!!\e"
M01260010,"\h(《Vyse》)It's no use…
It's locked from
the other side.\c"
M01260011,"\h(《Galcian》)Stop, Air Pirate!\e"
M01260012,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260013,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)So, these are the schematics that Lord De Loco
designed. With his new design, his ship is
supposed to be able to fly into Deep Sky?\e"
M01260014,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)That's what I hear. But it's not like I
can understand any of it anyway. It all looks
like scribbles to me.\c"
M01260015,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Well, I heard that Lord De Loco was going to
take Lord Galcian to take a look around the
Chameleon today…\c"
M01260016,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)What!? If they see us slacking off
here we're done for! Let's get out of here!\c"
M01260017,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
M01260018,"\h(《Vyse》)It's no use…
It's locked from
the other side.\e"
M01260019,"\h(《Vyse》)We can't let Gregorio's sacrifice be in vain!
We need to get out of here now!!\c"
M01260020,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn! It won't open!
Something's holding the door shut!\e"
M01260021,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, we don't have time!
Let's get out of here!!\c"
M01260022,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260023,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I still don't get why they would build a base
down here. What's the point? There's nothing
down here other than wind.\e"
M01260024,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I hear they're trying to build
an elevator that goes all the way into
Deep Sky…\e"
M01260025,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)D, Deep Sky?!
My mom told me when I was a kid that Deep Sky
is the land of the dead!!\c"
M01260026,"\h(《Valuan Solider》)An elevator that goes into Deep Sky?
Unbelievable…\c"
M01260027,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Intruders!!
Get them!!\c"
M01260028,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260029,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Hey, did you hear?
Lord Galcian is building a new
top-secret flagship.\c"
M01260030,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)It'll probably be even more powerful than his
old ship, the Serpent. I swear… that Lord
Galcian really is something.\e"
M01260031,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Did you know that Lord Galcian has never been
defeated in battle? He's a military genius!\c"
M01260032,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)As long as Lord Galcian is around to lead us,
we'll be fine. I doubt there's anyone who could
defeat him.\c"
M01260033,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)You… you're Vyse!?
What are you doing here!?\c"
M01260034,"\h(《Would you like to try again?》)“I never give up!”
“I quit.”\c"
