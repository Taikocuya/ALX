MJ0040000,\h(《Galcian》)Admirals of the Valuan Armada…\e
MJ0040001,\h(《Galcian》)I have urgent news that affects all of you.\e
MJ0040002,"\h(《Alfonso》)Hoho! Words of wisdom from the 
Grand Admiral himself?  
Please… enlighten us.\e"
MJ0040003,"\h(《Galcian》)From this day forth, the Armada will no longer 
be under the Empress' control.\e"
MJ0040004,"\h(《Galcian》)Those that do not wish to walk this path that I 
have chosen, leave now. Those that wish to hear
my plans, stay.\e"
MJ0040005,\h(《Alfonso》)What? What is this?!\e
MJ0040006,"\h(《Gregorio》)Admiral Galcian! Do you know what you are 
saying?!\e"
MJ0040007,"\h(《Alfonso》)Have you gone insane, Galcian?!
Are you rebelling against the Empress?\e"
MJ0040008,"\h(《Galcian》)Hahaha… Fear not, Alfonso. I still have my wits
about me. I am following my own path. It's your
decision whether or not you wish to follow me.\e"
MJ0040009,"\h(《Alfonso》)Hehehe…
So, Galcian finally shows his true intentions…\e"
MJ0040010,"\h(《Alfonso》)Those words are treasonous! The punishment is
death!\e"
MJ0040011,\h(《Alfonso》)Ramirez?!\e
MJ0040012,"\h(《Ramirez》)If you speak in that manner again, I shall 
cleave you in two.\e"
MJ0040013,\h(《Alfonso》)What? What do you mean?\e
MJ0040014,"\h(《Galcian》)Wait, Ramirez…
There is no need for you to waste your energy on
this whelp.\e"
MJ0040015,"\h(《Galcian》)What about the rest of you? 
Will you follow me?\e"
MJ0040016,\h(《Belleza》)Lord Galcian…\e
MJ0040017,"\h(《Vigoro》)It doesn't make any difference to me. As long as
I get to fight, I don't care who's in charge.\e"
MJ0040018,"\h(《De Loco》)I will stay in the Armada as well.
I still haven't finished building the ship that
can go into Deep Sky.\e"
MJ0040019,"\h(《De Loco》)Also, if I stay in the Armada… I'll probably
get to fight Vyse again! Hehehehe!!!\e"
MJ0040020,\h(《Gregorio》)……\e
MJ0040021,"\h(《Galcian》)Gregorio…
What will you do?\e"
MJ0040022,"\h(《Gregorio》)Lord Galcian…
What is your goal?\e"
MJ0040023,"\h(《Gregorio》)I do not think that you are seeking the Imperial
Throne… What is it you want?\e"
MJ0040024,"\h(《Galcian》)Hahaha…
You are correct… That is not my goal.\e"
MJ0040025,"\h(《Galcian》)I want more power…
More control than Valua has ever had.
That is all I will say for now.\e"
MJ0040026,"\h(《Gregorio》)Lord Galcian…
Just what are you up to…\e"
MJ0080000,\h(《Enrique》)Gregorio… you were like family to me…\e
MJ0080001,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Lord Galcian!
What is going on?!\e"
MJ0080002,"\h(《Galcian》)…Send him back to Valua. And make sure his body
is well taken care of. It is worth more than
your life.\e"
MJ0080003,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Yes, Lord Galcian!\e"
MJ0080004,"\h(《Galcian》)Gregorio… you were always the kind to be the
last to stay on a sinking ship.\e"
MK0160000,\h(《Vyse》)I hope this works!\e
MK0160001,"\h(《Gilder》)Well, there's only one way to find out.\e"
MK0160002,"\h(《Aika》)Alright!
It's moving!\e"
MK0160003,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah!
It looks like this will take us
straight to Soltis!\e"
MK0160004,\h(　)You'll be dead before you get there.\e
MK0160005,\h(《Vyse》)Huh?\e
MK0160006,"\h(《Vigoro》)Hey there, Red!
Did you miss me?\e"
MK0160007,"\h(《Aika》)Ewww… 
It's Vigoro!!!\e"
MK0160008,\h(《Vigoro》)I've been thinking about you… \e
MK0160009,"\h(《Aika》)I can't believe this guy!
He just doesn't know when to give up!!\e"
MK0160010,"\h(《Vigoro》)I remember you… Vyse. 
This time, I'm ready for you!\e"
MK0160011,\h(《Vyse》)Let's settle this once and for all!\e
MK0170000,"\h(《Vigoro》)Heh…
I… I give up… You're the better man.\e"
MK0170001,"\h(《Vigoro》)I didn't think that there was anyone else in 
this world other than Lord Galcian that could 
best me…\e"
MK0170002,"\h(《Vigoro》)Galcian and Ramirez are down below. 
Good luck, kid.\e"
MK0170003,"\h(《Vigoro》)Red…
Looks like this is good-bye…\e"
MK0170004,"\h(《Vigoro》)“The strongest man has the right to be with the
finest woman.”\e"
MK0170005,"\h(《Vigoro》)Vyse just stomped me pretty good… 
So, I don't deserve you.\e"
MK0170006,"\h(《Aika》)Wow, maybe if you didn't come on so strong, you
might actually be appealing. So what are you 
going to do now?\e"
MK0170007,"\h(《Vigoro》)I don't know…
Maybe I'll become an Air Pirate like you guys…\e"
MK0170008,"\h(《Vigoro》)As long as there are beautiful women in this 
world… I'll keep fighting!\e"
MK0170009,"\h(《Vigoro》)So long, Blue Rogues!
Maybe we'll run into each other again!\e"
MK0200000,\h(《Gilder》)Vyse! What's going on?!\e
MK0200001,\h(《Vyse》)I don't know!\e
MK0200002,\h(《Aika》)You've got to be kidding! \e
MK0200003,\h(《Vyse》)I'm trying! I'm trying!\e
MK0200004,"\h(《Vyse》)…It's no use.
There's no power!\e"
MK0200005,\h(《Vyse》)I got an idea!\e
MK0200006,\h(《Fina》)Vyse?\e
MK0200007,\h(《Aika》)Vyse! What do you think you're doing?!\e
MK0200008,\h(《Vyse》)Come on! Let's go!\e
MK0200009,"\h(《Aika》)Let's go?! What do you mean, “Let's go?”\e"
MK0200010,\h(《Aika》)You… you don't mean…\e
MK0200011,"\h(《Vyse》)Yes.
We're going to run up the rail.\e"
MK0200012,"\h(《Vyse》)Hurry! I don't know how much longer it will 
hold!\e"
MK0200013,\h(《Aika》)You're serious?!\e
MK0200014,"\h(《Gilder》)Vyse, umm… 
Some of us aren't as young as we used to be you
know…\e"
MK0200015,\h(《Vyse》)What's that?!\e
MK0200016,\h(《Gilder》)It's Soltis!\e
MK0200017,"\h(《Vyse》)Hurry, this railing isn't going to last much 
longer!\e"
MK0200018,\h(《Aika》)Fina… you go first!\e
MK0200019,\h(《Fina》)Okay!\e
MK0200020,\h(《Vyse》)RUN!!! Go! Go! Go!\e
MK0210000,\h(《Vyse》)That was too close!\e
MK0210001,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse!
This way! Hurry!\e"
MK0210002,"\h(《Gilder》)Hurry, Vyse!
Get off the rail!\e"
MK0210003,\h(《Aika》)Vyse!!\e
M01260000,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260001,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Moon Energy System operating within normal
parameters. Power supply to the entire base
is flowing smoothly.\e"
M01260002,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Okay, the inspection for this area is done.
Let's go to the next one.\e"
M01260003,"\h(《Vyse》)(I think that's the control area
for the base's power.)\c"
M01260004,"\h(《Vyse》)(I think that's the control area
for the base's power.)\c"
M01260005,"\h(《Vyse》)It's a fan. It's probably for ventilation.
I don't think I should get too close…\e"
M01260006,"\h(《Vyse》)But, it looks like there's a passageway behind
it. Hmm… I wonder if there's a way to stop the
fan…\c"
M01260007,"\h(《Vyse》)Whoa, now that's scary…
This must be an elevator shaft.\c"
M01260008,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm, it won't open…
It's probably locked or barred from the
other side.\c"
M01260009,"\h(《Enrique》)Gregorio!
Gregorio!!\e"
M01260010,"\h(《Vyse》)It's no use…
It's locked from
the other side.\c"
M01260011,"\h(《Galcian》)Stop, Air Pirate!\e"
M01260012,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260013,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)So, these are the schematics that Lord De Loco
designed. With his new design, his ship is
supposed to be able to fly into Deep Sky?\e"
M01260014,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)That's what I hear. But it's not like I
can understand any of it anyway. It all looks
like scribbles to me.\c"
M01260015,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Well, I heard that Lord De Loco was going to
take Lord Galcian to take a look around the
Chameleon today…\c"
M01260016,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)What!? If they see us slacking off
here we're done for! Let's get out of here!\c"
M01260017,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
M01260018,"\h(《Vyse》)It's no use…
It's locked from
the other side.\e"
M01260019,"\h(《Vyse》)We can't let Gregorio's sacrifice be in vain!
We need to get out of here now!!\c"
M01260020,"\h(《Vyse》)Damn! It won't open!
Something's holding the door shut!\e"
M01260021,"\h(《Aika》)Vyse, we don't have time!
Let's get out of here!!\c"
M01260022,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260023,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I still don't get why they would build a base
down here. What's the point? There's nothing
down here other than wind.\e"
M01260024,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)I hear they're trying to build
an elevator that goes all the way into
Deep Sky…\e"
M01260025,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)D, Deep Sky?!
My mom told me when I was a kid that Deep Sky
is the land of the dead!!\c"
M01260026,"\h(《Valuan Solider》)An elevator that goes into Deep Sky?
Unbelievable…\c"
M01260027,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Intruders!!
Get them!!\c"
M01260028,"\h(《Vyse》)Hm?
I can hear someone talking…\e"
M01260029,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Hey, did you hear?
Lord Galcian is building a new
top-secret flagship.\c"
M01260030,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)It'll probably be even more powerful than his
old ship, the Serpent. I swear… that Lord
Galcian really is something.\e"
M01260031,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)Did you know that Lord Galcian has never been
defeated in battle? He's a military genius!\c"
M01260032,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)As long as Lord Galcian is around to lead us,
we'll be fine. I doubt there's anyone who could
defeat him.\c"
M01260033,"\h(《Valuan Soldier》)You… you're Vyse!?
What are you doing here!?\c"
M01260034,"\h(《Would you like to try again?》)“I never give up!”
“I quit.”\c"
