ME0020000,"\h(《Aika》)Umm…
There are a bunch of people wearing masks…
And they have spears, too…\e"
ME0020001,\h(《Horteka Villager》)Are you Quetya?\e
ME0020002,\h(《Vyse》)Huh?\e
ME0020003,"\h(《Horteka Villager》)The girl… in the white clothes… 
is she Quetya?\e"
ME0020004,"\h(《Fina》)What?
Are they talking about me?\e"
ME0020005,"\h(《Vyse》)Umm… we're Blue Rogues. 
We came across the South Ocean.\e"
ME0020006,"\h(《Horteka Villager》)You are not Quetya…
You are the same as the other men from the East.
It is best if you leave soon.\e"
ME0020007,"\h(《Vyse》)What did I say?
What do they mean “Quetya” and who are the
“Men from the East”?\e"
ME0020008,"\h(《Fina》)I have no idea.
I don't know what they're talking about.\e"
ME0020009,"\h(《Drachma》)We should meet with the leader of the village.
He might be able to explain what's going on
here.\e"
ME0020010,"\h(《Drachma》)Also, that trip across South Ocean has depleted
our fuel supply. We need to stock up on Moon
Stones if we ever want to leave this place.\e"
ME0020011,"\h(《Vyse》)Okay… let's find the leader of this village…  
Maybe we'll be able to find some Moon Stones 
here as well.\e"
ME0040000,"\h(《Elder》)So, you are from the East.
Your people bring disaster. 
Leave this village immediately.\e"
ME0040001,"\h(《Vyse》)Wait a minute!
Why does everyone keep talking about these
“Men from the East” and this “Quetya” stuff?\e"
ME0040002,\h(《Vyse》)I don't even know what a “Quetya” is! \e
ME0040003,"\h(《Elder》)Quetya is our god. Generations ago, when the 
giant came to destroy us, Quetya appeared and 
saved our village.\e"
ME0040004,"\h(《Elder》)Ancient prophecies say that Quetya's messengers
will come from the East and save us if our land
is ever in danger.\e"
ME0040005,"\h(《Vyse》)I understand… and since we came from the East, 
that is why everyone thinks “Quetya” sent us.\e"
ME0040006,"\h(《Aika》)But… if Quetya's messengers are supposed to
save you, why did you say that people from the
East bring disaster?\e"
ME0040007,"\h(《Elder》)Even now, the men from the East are destroying
our land. They claim they come from a place
called Valua.\e"
ME0040008,"\h(《Aika》)Valua?!
They're here, too?\e"
ME0040009,"\h(《Elder》)When the people from Valua came, everyone 
thought that Quetya sent them. Even the king 
came to greet them.\e"
ME0040010,"\h(《Elder》)The people from Valua said they wanted Moon 
Stones. We took them to our Sacred Mountain 
where we keep Glow Rocks.\e"
ME0040011,"\h(《Fina》)So, the Valuans came to steal their
Moon Stones…\e"
ME0040012,"\h(《Elder》)And then the people from Valua attacked us with 
fire-breathing iron ships. They took control 
of Sacred Mountain.\e"
ME0040013,"\h(《Elder》)Everyone… even the king fought…
But many were killed and the forest was burned. 
The survivors… were taken as slaves…\e"
ME0040014,"\h(《Aika》)That's terrible!
They are using your people to gather the
Moon Stones so they can make weapons!\e"
ME0040015,"\h(《Vyse》)So that's why everyone is so against the
“Men from the East”.\e"
ME0040016,"\h(《Vyse》)Please…
You need to trust us. We are different from 
the Valuans… the “Men from the East”.\e"
ME0040017,"\h(《Vyse》)We fight against Valua so they can't hurt 
people…\e"
ME0040018,"\h(《Vyse》)And that is why we've come all this way… 
We need a very precious stone, called 
a Moon Crystal.\e"
ME0040019,\h(《Elder》)…\e
ME0040020,"\h(《Drachma》)You can't expect him to trust us…
You're wasting your time, boy!\e"
ME0040021,"\h(《Vyse》)…Please, I am telling the truth.
Please…\e"
ME0040022,"\h(《Elder》)…If you fly north from this village, you'll see
a small hut in the middle of the forest. 
That is where our king is hiding.\e"
ME0040023,"\h(《Elder》)The kings of our land have always passed down 
the Sacred Green Stone from generation to 
generation. This may be the stone that you seek.\e"
ME0040024,"\h(《Elder》)Your eyes. They are pure.
I believe that you are here to help us.
Please… save our people.\e"
ME0040025,"\h(《Vyse》)Thank you…
I will not betray you.\e"
ME0040026,"\h(《Vyse》)Let's go!
We've got a village to save…\e"
M05000000,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)…
I have nothing to sell to a person from the
east.\c"
M05000001,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)The elder says I must help you. So even though I
don't like it, I will sell to you.\e"
M05000002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons”
“Talk to the Merchant”
“Leave”\e"
M05000003,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)For a long time, we did not fight wars. Weapons
were only for hunting, or as defense from wild
animals.\e"
M05000004,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)But ever since the Valuans arrived, I have
started making weapons to use against people.\c"
M05000005,\h(《Weapons Merchant》)…\c
M05000006,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)You are a hero to all who live in the forest.
I'd be honored if you used my weapons.\e"
M05000007,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell weapons”
“Talk to the Merchant”
“Leave”\e"
M05000008,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)The men of the village have returned. I'm going
to work hard to make weapons. We want to protect
the village with our own hands.\e"
M05000009,"\h(《Weapons Merchant》)This weapon I made, I made it with a prayer for
the forest. Please make good use of it.\c"
M05010000,\h(《Item Merchant's Daughter》)…\c
M05010001,\h(《Item Merchant's Daughter》)…Is there something you'd like to buy?\e
M05010002,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk to the Merchant”
“Leave the shop”\e"
M05010003,"\h(《Item Merchant's Daughter》)The Valuans, they were looking for the Sacred
Green Stone. They said it shines even brighter
than a Moon Stone.\e"
M05010004,"\h(《Item Merchant's Daughter》)I've never seen a stone like that, but they took
away everything in the shop anyway. \e"
M05010005,\h(《Item Merchant's Daughter》)…\c
M05010006,"\h(《Item Merchant's Daughter》)All because of you, the forest has been saved.
It would make me happy if any of my items proved
useful to you.\e"
M05010007,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Buy and iell items”
“Talk to the Merchant”
“Leave the shop”\e"
M05010008,"\h(《Item Merchant's Daughter》)Our forest burned, but it will revive quickly.
The Forest of Ixa'taka is very strong.\e"
M05010009,\h(《Item Merchant's Daughter》)Thank you. May Quetya be with you.\c
M05020000,\h(《Tavernkeep》)Get out! We don't have food for Easterners!\c
M05020001,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)This tavern was a good tavern. Merida's dancing 
made everybody happy. My loqua kept everybody 
in good spirits.\e"
M05020002,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Then the Valuans came, captured some, killed 
others, and stole our food and drink.\e"
M05020003,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Merida won't dance anymore. The others won't 
laugh anymore. My tavern has nothing left.\e"
M05020004,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Merida won't dance anymore. The others won't 
laugh anymore. My tavern has nothing left.\e"
M05020005,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Everybody came back. Merida is dancing again. 
I thank you.\e"
M05020006,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)Eat all you want. Drink all you want. For you, 
it is free.\e"
M05020007,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)A while ago, Merida wrote a letter and put it in
a bottle tied to a red balloon. I saw her
release it into the air.\e"
M05020008,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)I think it was a very important letter to 
Merida.\e"
M05020009,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)When Merida left, my tavern became a very lonely
place.\e"
M05020010,"\h(《Tavernkeep》)But if she is happy dancing in your ship, then
it is worth it. If Merida is happy, I am happy.\c"
M05030000,\h(《Young maiden》)……\e
M05030001,"\h(《Merida》)I am Merida, the dancer of this tavern. When I 
dance, I make everybody happy. 
But… I, I cannot dance anymore. \e"
M05030002,"\h(《Merida》)The Valuans killed my father. And they killed 
many of my friends, too.\e"
M05030003,"\h(《Merida》)Now, when I dance, it does not make people 
happy. So, I dance no more.\e"
M05030004,"\h(《Merida》)Now, when I dance, it does not make people 
happy. So, I dance no more.\e"
M05030005,"\h(《Merida》)Everybody has returned, except for my father. He
was killed, so he cannot come home. But I will
dance again to make the people happy once more.\e"
M05030006,"\h(《Merida》)But I… I will never forgive Valua. Someday I 
will get my own ship. I will avenge my father.\c"
M05030007,"\h(《Merida》)But I… I will never forgive Valua. Someday I 
will get my own ship. I will avenge my father.\c"
M05030008,"\h(《Merida》)That is a very powerful ship that you have. I 
hope one day I will board a ship. I look for 
comrades to help me get revenge on Valua.\e"
M05030009,"\h(《Merida》)I wrote a letter to Quetya and sent it into the 
sky. I asked Quetya to please send me strong 
warriors to aid my cause.\e"
M05030010,"\h(《Merida》)That is a very powerful ship that you have. I 
hope one day I will board a ship. I look for 
comrades to help me get revenge on Valua.\e"
M05030011,"\h(《Merida》)I wrote a letter to Quetya and sent it into the
sky. I asked Quetya to please send me strong 
warriors to aid my cause.\e"
M05030012,"\h(《Vyse》)Could this be that letter by any chance? 
I picked it up in the Ocean.\e"
M05030013,"\h(《Merida》)That is the letter that I wrote to Quetya! I 
sent it looking for help.\e"
M05030014,"\h(《Merida》)Quetya surely sent you to me. You must be the
warriors that I am waiting for.\e"
M05030015,"\h(《Merida》)Please! Take me with you! I want to fight 
against Valua!\e"
M05030016,"\h(《Merida》)I… I may not be strong, but I can dance. 
My dancing will lift everyone's spirits!\e"
M05030017,\h(　)Merida has joined your crew as a “Jester.”\c
M05040000,\h(《Masked Man》)I want nothing to do with you.\c
M05040001,"\h(《Masked Man》)You look for the Sacred Green Stone, just like 
the Valuans.\e"
M05040002,"\h(《Masked Man》)The Valuans demanded that I tell them where the 
Sacred Green Stone was. They beat me over and 
over… I thought I was going to die…\e"
M05040003,"\h(《Masked Man》)The Valuans demanded that I tell them where the 
Sacred Green Stone was. They beat me over and 
over… I thought I was going to die…\e"
M05040004,"\h(《Masked Man》)I saw the Giant of the Forest! Legend has it
that the Giant of the Forest will protect us. 
But I'm not so sure about that…\e"
M05040005,"\h(《Masked Man》)The Giant of the Forest was surely created by 
someone with an evil heart. Evil will not 
protect us. It is good that you stopped it. \e"
M05040006,"\h(《Masked Man》)Welcome, welcome. You are our heroes. It is an 
honor to have you here. Please make yourselves 
at home.\e"
M05040007,"\h(《Masked Man》)You people came from the east? You made it 
through the wall of rocks?\e"
M05040008,"\h(《Masked Man》)Long ago, many brave men made attempts to break 
through the wall of rocks. All failed, and the 
rocks destroyed their ships. You are amazing!\e"
M05040009,\h(《Masked Man》)The forest… Something bad is happening there…\e
M05050000,"\h(《Elder》)…So you are the ones from the east who people 
have been talking about.\c"
M05050001,"\h(《Elder》)You must go see the king. He lives in a hut to 
the north. The hut is protected by a giant tree.\c"
M05050002,"\h(《Elder》)So you intend to go to Moon Stone Mountain, 
do you?\e"
M05050003,"\h(《Elder》)Moon Stone Mountain is where our comrades are 
imprisoned. If there is any disturbance, they 
will be killed. Please be very careful.\e"
M05050004,"\h(《Elder》)So High Priest Isapa is safe. It is wonderful to
hear. I hope the others are safe, too.\c"
M05050005,"\h(《Elder》)My deepest gratitude. Thanks to you, the people 
have safely returned to their homes.\e"
M05050006,"\h(《Elder》)You people are not Quetya, but I think it was 
Quetya who sent you to us.\e"
M05050007,"\h(《Elder》)Like all those who Quetya sends to us, you are 
welcome in this village any time. The people of 
the forest will help you.\c"
M05050008,"\h(《Elder》)Like all those who Quetya sent to us, you are 
welcome in this village any time. The people of 
the forest will help you.\c"
M05050009,"\h(《Elder》)Ahh, it is Lord Vyse! What in the world is this 
trembling of the sky? What could be going on?\e"
M05050010,"\h(《Elder》)What? You say a new continent has risen from 
beneath the clouds? It is a fearsome thing.\e"
M05050011,"\h(《Elder》)What? You say a new continent has risen from 
beneath the clouds? It is a fearsome thing.\e"
M05060000,"\h(《High Priest》)Quetya and the people of the east, we once 
confused. But we will confuse the two no more.\c"
M05060001,"\h(《High Priest》)“From the east will come the one who can
vanquish the Great Evil.” That was the prophecy 
from Quetya.\e"
M05060002,"\h(《High Priest》)Quetya is a god from the east. Long, long ago, 
Quetya saved our forest from a dangerous enemy.\e"
M05060003,"\h(《High Priest》)Whenever our forest is in danger, Quetya always 
comes to our rescue.\c"
M05060004,"\h(《High Priest》)Quetya is a god from the east. Quetya will 
surely appear and save us from Valua.\c"
M05060005,"\h(《High Priest》)Quetya's prophecy has been fulfilled. Quetya has
indeed saved us.\e"
M05060006,"\h(《High Priest》)You people were sent by the god Quetya. Quetya 
took on your forms to come and save us.\c"
M05060007,"\h(《High Priest》)There was a prophecy that evil would come from 
the east. Is something terrible about to occur?\c"
M05070000,"\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)So you're from the east? You look tired. Would 
you like a room for the night? It'll be 160 
gold.\e"
M05070001,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M05070002,\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)Sleep well…\c
M05070003,"\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)You seem refreshed. Come again any time you need
a rest.\c"
M05070004,"\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)People from the east get tired just like anyone 
else. Don't worry about it. Come again any time 
you need a rest.\c"
M05070010,"\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)…You don't have enough money.
Come back when you have enough.\c"
M05070005,"\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)You saved the village! Thank you. Stay awhile 
here and get a good rest.\e"
M05070006,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M05070007,\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)Sleep well…\c
M05070008,"\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)You seem refreshed. Come again any time you need
a rest.\c"
M05070009,"\h(《Elderly Innkeeper》)You must be careful not to push yourself beyond 
your limits. Come again any time you need a 
rest.\c"
M05140000,\h(《Woman》)Urrrr… Go away! Scram! Don't bother me!\c
M05140001,"\h(《Woman》)My son, he was taken away by the Valuans to work

but he is alive and well. Thank you. Thank you.\c"
M05140005,"\h(《Woman》)My son is alive and well, and with me again. 
Everyday, I feel so happy. I am so happy.\c"
M05140006,"\h(《Woman》)I sense something bad, evil. Something terrible
is going to happen again. I am afraid. I am very
afraid.\c"
M05150000,"\h(《Masked Man》)Ahh! You're the one who got rid of the Valuans! 
It's only because of you that I was saved.\e"
M05150001,"\h(《Masked Man》)On Moon Stone Mountain, they made me work. It 
was very hard. But thanks to you, I came home 
alive.\e"
M05150002,"\h(《Masked Man》)Here, my thanks. Please put it to good use.\e"
M05150003,\h(　)You received 1 “Tropica.”\c
M05150004,"\h(《Masked Man》)On Moon Stone Mountain, they made me work. It

M05150005,"\h(《Masked Man》)Ahh, it's you! My savior. Let me tell you 
something interesting.\e"
M05150006,"\h(《Masked Man》)Somewhere in the lower parts of this island,
there is a fruit called the “Garpa Fruit.” It
is very tasty.\e"

try them, too.\c"
M05150008,"\h(《Masked Man》)Somewhere in the lower parts of this island,

is very tasty.\c"
M05160000,\h(《Masked Man》)……\c
M05160001,"\h(《Masked Man》)The men of Ixa'taka are all warriors. We protect
the forest, protect our king. We can strike down
wild animals in a single blow.\e"
M05160002,"\h(《Masked Man》)But we let our guard down. We thought Valua was 
not the enemy. We even held a festival to 
welcome them.\e"
M05160003,"\h(《Masked Man》)Suddenly, Valua captured the king, and the sky 
filled with ships that spat fire. We could do 
nothing.\c"
M05160004,"\h(《Masked Man》)Suddenly, Valua captured the king, and the sky 
filled with ships that spat fire. We could do

will get past me, not Valua, not the giant. This
I swear.\c"
M05160008,"\h(《Masked Man》)A little while ago, many steel ships came from 
Valua, flying over the forest.\e"
M05160009,"\h(《Masked Man》)We prepared to fight. The women and children hid
in the forest. But the ships passed us by, and
went west.\e"
M05160010,"\h(《Masked Man》)The other day, the Valuans returned from the 
west. There were less ships, and all of them 
were damaged. What happened in the west?\c"
M05160011,"\h(《Masked Man》)The other day, the Valuans returned from the 
west. There were less ships, and all of them 
were damaged. What happened in the west?\c"
M05160012,"\h(《Masked Man》)Something very serious is going to happen in the
east. Is your battle connected with this thing
in the east?\e"

M05170000,\h(《Masked Man》)…\c
M05170001,"\h(《Masked Man》)This song is for Quetya. When the Valuans came, 
I played this song in the welcome festival.\e"
M05170002,"\h(《Masked Man》)Now I play to ask Quetya to come, and drive off 
the Valuans.\c"
M05170003,"\h(《Masked Man》)This song is for Quetya. It thanks Quetya for 
bringing everyone home.\c"
M05180000,"\h(《Girl》)Are you from the east? Everyone hates people 
from the east. You'd best be on your way.\c"
M05180001,\h(《Girl》)The Elder said you defeated Valua. Is it true?\e
M05180002,"\h(《Girl》)I have always believed in Quetya. I believe 
someday Quetya will come, and destroy Valua for 
us.\e"
M05180003,"\h(《Girl》)Maybe you were sent here by Quetya.
Do you think so?\c"
M05180004,"\h(《Girl》)I have always believed in Quetya. I believe

many things from here… Oops!\e"
M05210001,"\h(《Masked Man》)I must not talk to people from the east. You'd 
better forget what I said.\c"
M05210002,\h(《Masked Man》)…\c
M05210003,\h(《Masked Man》)You are not a bad man. The Elder said so.\e

M05210010,"\h(《Tikatika》)Aha! A golden man. To the north, I see a golden 
man.\e"
M05210011,"\h(《Tikatika》)In the northern sky there is a golden man.
It is the truth. Go and see for yourself.\c"
M05210012,"\h(《Tikatika》)Shucks, you're no fun. It is the truth. My eyes 
are very good. Incredible even!\c"
M05210013,"\h(《Tikatika》)My eyes are sharper than the birds'. Shall I 
show you?\e"
M05210014,"\h(《Tikatika》)You defeated the giant. I saw it from here. You 
are awesome!\c"
M05210015,"\h(《Tikatika》)You have a nice ship. Have you flown around here
a lot? Do you know this area well?\e"
M05210016,"\h(《Tikatika》)Have you seen a ship with all women sailors
around here? Sometimes I see them flying nearby.
They are very different from the women here.\e"
M05210017,"\h(《Tikatika》)Even with my eyes, I cannot always see where 
they go. I am very curious about them.\e"
M05210018,"\h(《Vyse》)A place with just women? Hmm…
Sorry, can't help you there.\e"
M05210019,"\h(《Tikatika》)Too bad.
I won't leave here until I find out!\c"
M05210020,"\h(《Vyse》)Women only? Maybe you're talking about the 
“Village of the Ixa'ness.”\e"
M05210021,"\h(《Tikatika》)Yes! Yes! That must be it! So, there really is
a village of only women… I've been searching
for it for many years. Thank you.\e"
M05210022,"\h(《Tikatika》)You are the best sailor I know. Take me with
you on your ship. I want to travel with you.\e"
M05210023,\h(《Vyse》)Really? You'll join the crew of my ship?\e
M05210024,"\h(《Tikatika》)That's right, I'll join your crew. I've been 
looking for someone who could make good use of 
my incredible eyes.\e"
M05210025,"\h(《Tikatika》)With my eyes, I can see the enemy from far away.
Other things, too, as clear as day. This will be
useful to you.\e"
M05210026,\h(　)Tikatika has joined your crew as a “Lookout.”\c
M05300000,"\h(《Masked Man》)Ahh, you're Vyse! It's all thanks to you that my
life was saved.\e"
M05300001,"\h(《Masked Man》)I was forced to work on Moon Stone Mountain. 
My mother was all alone, back in the village, 
and I couldn't go home. I was very worried.\e"
M05300002,"\h(《Masked Man》)But because of you, I was able to come home to 
my mother. Thank you. Thank you.\c"
M05300003,"\h(《Masked Man》)But because of you, I was able to come home to 
my mother. Thank you. Thank you.\c"
M05300004,"\h(《Masked Man》)Something is happening again in the east.
Are we going to be invaded again?\e"
M05300005,"\h(《Masked Man》)This time, nothing can take me away from my 
mother's side. I will stay right here and 
protect my mother. \e"
Ms010a000,"\h(《Vyse》)I wonder what this is? It looks like
ground up berries and herbs…
I wonder what they're used for…\c"
Ms010a001,"\h(《Vyse》)It's full of berries and dried meat.
It looks pretty tasty…\c"
Ms010a002,"\h(《Vyse》)There's water here. It looks fresh and it's
still relatively cold. It's probably from the
river that runs beneath the town.\c"
Ms010a003,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like you put wood inside and burn it to
cook things. I guess it's an Ixa'takan stove.
Maybe they don't use Moon Stones as fuel.\c"
Ms010a004,"\h(《Vyse》)It's some liquid, almost like honey.
There's a really sweet smell
that's filling the whole room.\c"
Ms010a005,"\h(《Vyse》)Now THAT'S a big vat of… something. Whatever it
is, it looks sticky. I wouldn't want to fall
into there, that's for sure.\c"
Ms010a006,"\h(《Vyse》)This jar's empty…
Maybe they use it to carry the stuff
that's in the big vat?\c"
Ms010a007,"\h(《Vyse》)Mmm… That looks good. I guess Aika was right
about the fruit here. There seems to be
plenty of it, that's for sure.\c"
Ms010a008,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like you put wood inside and burn it to
cook things. I guess it's an Ixa'takan stove.
Maybe they don't use Moon Stones as fuel.\c"
Ms010a009,"\h(《Vyse》)It's covered with some animal skin. That's
probably how they keep their food fresh. Looks
like there's some salted meat inside.\c"
Ms010a010,"\h(《Vyse》)Hmm… It's a piece of wood that looks like it's
been carved. It doesn't look quite finished,
though. I wonder what it's supposed to be?\c"
Ms010a011,"\h(《Vyse》)It's empty…
It smells like there used to be some sort of
juice or nectar in here…\c"
Ms010a012,"\h(《Vyse》)There're all kinds of different masks.
I wonder if each one has a different
meaning or something?\c"
Ms010a013,"\h(《Vyse》)It's covered with some animal skin. That's
probably how they keep their food fresh. Looks
like there's some salted meat inside.\c"
Ms010a014,"\h(《Vyse》)It's an article of Ixa'takan clothing. I can't
tell whether you're supposed to wear it around
your waist or over your shoulder…\c"
Ms010a015,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like you put wood inside and burn it to
cook things. I guess it's an Ixa'takan stove.
Maybe they don't use Moon Stones as fuel.\c"
Ms010a016,"\h(《Vyse》)It looks like this spear and mask
haven't been used in a while.
There's a layer of dust on both of them.\c"
Ms010a017,"\h(《Vyse》)This must be the son of the household's
spear and mask. It looks worn in.
He must go hunting every day.\c"
Ms010a018,"\h(《Vyse》)It's covered with some animal skin. That's
probably how they keep their food fresh. Looks
like there's some salted meat inside.\c"
Ms010a019,"\h(《Vyse》)Mmm… Looks tasty.
Horteka has some of the best fruit
I've ever seen.\c"
Ms010a020,"\h(《Vyse》)There are some assorted dried leaves inside the
pot. Maybe these leaves are what's making this
place smell so nice…\c"
Ms010a021,"\h(《Vyse》)I've never seen Ixa'takan craftwork before.
It's so raw… and natural. It's strange… but
beautiful in its own way.\c"
Ms010a022,"\h(《Vyse》)Ack! There's something in the water! Wait…
It's actually kinda cute. Heh heh… I wonder
what it's called?\c"
Ms010a023,"\h(《Vyse》)There're some offerings of fruit.
I guess this picture is of that guy, Quetya,
that the Ixa'takans keep talking about…\c"
Ms010a024,"\h(《Vyse》)It's an altar to the “god,” Quetya.
Who would've thought Quetya was actually
a Silvite?\c"
Ms010a025,"\h(《Vyse》)They probably use this stage for religious
ceremonies and celebrations or something.\c"
Ms010a026,"\h(《Vyse》)This is the way to the boat… but we can't leave
until we get some more fuel and talk to the
village elder to find out about the Crystal.\c"
Ms010a029,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Return to your ship.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
