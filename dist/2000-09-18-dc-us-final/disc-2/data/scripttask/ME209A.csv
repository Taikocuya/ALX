MC0130000,\h(《Aika》)Aah!\e
MC0130001,"\h(《Aika》)Who's that?! Vyse, there's something about this 
guy… I'm not sure what it is, but I don't think
we can take him.\e"
MC0130002,"\h(《Vyse》)Yeah…
And he looks really mad too!
\e"
MC0130003,"\h(《Vyse》)Aika, here's the plan…
Run!!!
We have to get Fina before he catches us!\e"
MC0150000,"\h(《Aika》)I'm so glad you're safe, Fina!
We were worried about you.\e"
MC0150001,"\h(《Fina》)Vyse…
Aika…
How did you… Why?\e"
MC0150002,"\h(《Vyse》)Why do you think?
We're here to save you!\e"
MC0150003,\h(《Fina》)You mean… you did all this… just for… me?\e
MC0150004,"\h(《Aika》)Aww, Fina…
We're friends! 
We weren't going to let them take you from us.\e"
MC0150005,\h(《Fina》)Thank you both so much!\e
MC0150006,"\h(《Fina》)Honestly,
I… I was so scared… I was all alone…
I was afraid that they were going to hurt me.\e"
MC0150007,"\h(《Fina》)Oh, thank you… I'm… I'm so grateful!\e"
MC0150008,"\h(《Vyse》)Everything is okay now, Fina.
Now, let's get out of here!\e"
MC0150009,\h(《Galcian》)I can't allow that.\e
MC0150010,"\h(《Vyse》)What?!
He found us!\e"
MC0150011,"\h(《Galcian》)I am Galcian, Lord of the Imperial Armada.\e"
MC0150012,"\h(《Galcian》)You have caused us a great deal of trouble, boy.
What is your name?\e"
MC0150013,"\h(《Vyse》)I'm Vyse of the Blue Rogues.
I just thought you were the guy that cleaned the
rail cars.\e"
MC0150014,"\h(《Galcian》)Ah… so you are the one who made a fool out of 
Alfonso.\e"
MC0150015,"\h(《Galcian》)That girl is worth nothing to you Air Pirates. 
Hand her over to me.\e"
MC0150016,"\h(《Galcian》)I guarantee that your lives, as well as that of 
the girl, will be spared. Is it a deal?\e"
MC0150017,"\h(《What will you do?》)“Never!”
“… Sounds fair…”\e"
MC0150018,"\h(《Vyse》)Never!
I don't know what you want with her…\e"
MC0150019,"\h(《Vyse》)But you're Valuans. Whatever it is, 
it can't be good.\e"
MC0150020,"\h(《Galcian》)Do you honestly think that after attacking the 
Valuan Armada you'll be able to fly the 
skies freely?\e"
MC0150021,"\h(《Vyse》)We're Air Pirates. We don't need your permission
for anything…
If we see something we want, we take it.\e"
MC0150022,"\h(《Galcian》)That's very disappointing.
I'm afraid you leave me no choice…
I must destroy you.\e"
MC0150023,"\h(《Vyse》)…Sounds fair…
We'll hand over Fina if you can guarantee that 
she won't be harmed.\e"
MC0150024,\h(《Aika》)How can you do that Vyse?! Are you crazy!? \e
MC0150025,\h(《Aika》)You can't have her!\e
MC0150026,"\h(《Galcian》)That's very disappointing.
I'm afraid you leave me no choice…
I will destroy you both.\e"
MC0150027,\h(《Vyse》)The Little Jack!\e
MC0250006,"\h(《Vyse》)Fina should be at the front of the rail car. 
Let's go!\e"
