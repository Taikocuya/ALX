Ms028b000,"\h(《Aika》)Wow… So this is what the Great Silver Shrine
looks like. It's… It's amazing…\e"
Ms028b001,\h(《Fina》)Vyse… Do you see that building over there?\e
Ms028b002,"\h(《Fina》)That is the “Room of the Elders.”
It is the heart of this shrine.\e"
Ms028b003,"\h(《Fina》)To get there, we must travel through the “Path
of Emptiness.” But be careful… or else you
might lose all sense of direction in there.\e"
Ms028b004,"\h(《Gilder》)Great… This sounds like it's going to be loads
of fun. Well, I guess all we have to do is just
not get lost, right? C'mon, Vyse!\c"
Ms028b005,"\h(《Elder Prime's Voice》)Island-dwellers…
If you wish, I can send you back to the
entrance of the shrine.\e"
Ms028b006,"\h(《What will you say?》)“That would be great.”
“No thanks… We can walk.”\e"
Ms028b007,"\h(《Elder Prime's Voice》)Very well.
Hold still…\c"
Ms028b008,"\h(《Elder Prime's Voice》)I see. Very well, then. If you change your
mind, return here and I will extend the same
offer as before.\c"
