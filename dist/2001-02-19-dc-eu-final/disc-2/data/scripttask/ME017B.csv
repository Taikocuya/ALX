M01000000,"\h(«Polly»)This place isn't bad. It sort of reminds me
of my tavern back on Sailors' Island.\e"
M01000001,\h(«Polly»)I think I'll be able to cook here… \e
M01000002,"\h(«Polly»)But, the kitchen could use a little work.
It needs some remodeling if I'm going to make
some of my more popular dishes.\c"
M01000003,"\h(«Polly»)If you let me remodel the place, I'll be able 
to open a tavern here on your island.\c"
M01140000,"\h(«Pinta»)This is a really nice island! It's even in a 
great location, too! We should be able to go on 
all sorts of adventures from here.\e"
M02000000,"\h(«Marco»)I never thought that I would ever be able to get
out of Valua. And I never knew the outside world
was so big!\e"
M02000001,"\h(«Marco»)After your little pep talk, I've been wanting to
see as much of the world as I can. Thanks, Vyse!
I can't wait to go sailing again!\c"
M02000002,"\h(«Marco»)Heh… The biggest surprise for me after getting 
out of Valua was probably the sky… It's blue. 
I've never seen a blue sky before…\e"
M02000003,"\h(«Marco»)And the clouds are white! I thought they were 
all dark like the ones in Valua!\e"
M02000004,"\h(«Marco»)Hey, don't laugh! If you lived in Lower City 
your whole life, you'd understand!\c"
M02000005,"\h(«Marco»)So, how's the ship's new engine doing?\e"
M02000006,"\h(«Marco»)Heh… Who'd have thought that I'd become an
engineer… I actually helped build that thing!
I did a pretty good job if I do say so myself.\c"
M02000007,"\h(«Marco»)Welcome back, Vyse! I bet you were surprised to
find the island all fixed up, weren't you?\e"
M02000008,"\h(«Marco»)I helped Izmael a lot, too! Okay, well… I only 
painted the walls, but it was still a lot 
of work!\c"
M02000009,"\h(«Marco»)Hey, you guys saw the shooting stars that 
were falling over Valua, right?\e"
M02000010,"\h(«Marco»)Ever since that happened, you and Aika have 
been looking pretty upset. What's up? Did 
something bad happen?\c"
M02000011,"\h(«Marco»)The Armada made the Moon Stones fall on Valua,
huh?\e"
M02000012,"\h(«Marco»)I… I didn't really like the place, but… I grew
up there. It makes me sad that it's all gone.\e"
M02000013,"\h(«Marco»)Vyse, promise me that we'll beat the Armada. 
We can't let them get away with what they've
done.\c"
M02000014,"\h(«Marco»)We have to stop them before they destroy all 
of the other lands. There's so much I haven't
seen yet.\c"
M04090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Welcome. Heed my words and the future will be
known…\e"
M04090001,"\h(«Will you have your fortune told?»)“Pay 10 gold for your fortune.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M04090002,\h( )You gave 10 gold to Kalifa.\e
M04090003,"\h(«Kalifa»)Very well.
Let us begin.\e"
M04090004,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm…\e
M04090005,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa!!!\e
M04090006,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Remember to chew 
your food well before swallowing!\e"
M04090007,"\h(«Kalifa»)That way you won't choke on it, and it
also aids the digestion process.\c"
M04090008,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Having a low
“Swashbuckler Rating” will affect your mission!\e"
M04090009,"\h(«Kalifa»)When you have a low rating, it will become
easier to run from fights and easier to avoid
them all together!\c"
M04090010,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Hmm… it looks like
tomorrow will be partly cloudy and there is
chance of rain in some areas.\e"
M04090011,"\h(«Kalifa»)So, if you have any laundry out to dry, you
better bring it inside today!\c"
M04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Having a high
“Swashbuckler Rating” will affect the morale
of your crew in a positive manner.\e"
M04090013,"\h(«Kalifa»)Your bravery will show through in battle,
as well! Your fighting abilities will raise
depending on your ability as a leader!\c"
M04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! On… Pirate Isle…
the little girl named Lindsi… Oh, no! She will
be playing on the dock and… and…\e"
M04090015,"\h(«Kalifa»)… and she's going to get a splinter
in her finger!\c"
M04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! A woman from a tavern
and a man who sits alone in silence will be
reunited!\e"
M04090017,"\h(«Kalifa»)And they will live happily ever after once 
they are together again as husband and wife. 
Such a happy ending…\c"
M04090018,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! 
Your lucky number is 4. 
Your lucky color is… umm… blue.\e"
M04090019,"\h(«Kalifa»)Couples should spend more time outdoors!
Fresh air and beautiful scenery can be 
invigorating…\c"
M04090020,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! On Sailors' Island,
there are some rare items for sale.\e"
M04090021,"\h(«Kalifa»)So, be sure to check back there as often as
possible to see what new wares are in the
merchants' possession!\c"
M04090022,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! You will meet many
people during your travels. You will also part
with many people…\e"
M04090023,"\h(«Kalifa»)…What? You say that could be anyone's fortune?!
Skeptic! You must learn to accept your own fate.
Then you will learn your true purpose.\c"
M04090024,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! In this world, there
are 3 special Chams called “Abirik Chams.”\e"
M04090025,"\h(«Kalifa»)You never know where you'll get them from, so
make sure to be nice to people… they may
surprise you with a gift.\c"
M04090026,"\h(«Kalifa»)Defensive techniques only last for one round,
but their effect is guaranteed.\e"
M04090027,"\h(«Kalifa»)So, if you can anticipate your enemies' moves,
you will be able to render their attacks
ineffective.\c"
M04090028,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Once you are the
captain of your own ship and your Spirits
are as high as they can be…\e"
M04090029,"\h(«Kalifa»)You will gain the power to call forth all of
your allies to battle by your side.\c"
M04090030,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Your crew will react
differently depending on the condition of your
ship.\e"
M04090031,"\h(«Kalifa»)Once you have a crew, talk to them often.
Especially when all seems lost.\c"
M04090032,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! If you want to
make your cannons more effective, seek out
a “Gunner” for your crew.\e"
M04090033,"\h(«Kalifa»)On the other hand, if you wish to increase the
defensive power of your ship, then you should
find an “Engineer” to help maintain it.\c"
M04090034,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Princess Moegi will 
find love. But that love will cause her great
pain.\e"
M04090035,"\h(«Kalifa»)I… I cannot see more. The future hangs in the
balance. You must be strong, for you carry the
fate of the world on your shoulders.\c"
M04090036,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! If you always stand
your ground in a fight, word will spread
amongst the people of your bravery.\e"
M04090037,"\h(«Kalifa»)On the other hand, if you always flee from your
adversaries, the people will learn of your
cowardice. Be careful in your actions.\c"
M04090038,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! When a Moon Stone 
becomes contaminated, it becomes a “Chom.”
They have the opposite effect as “Chams.”\e"
M04090039,"\h(«Kalifa»)Giving Cupil a Chom will result in him
regurgitating all of the Chams that he has eaten
up until that point. Use them wisely.\c"
M04090040,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Tonight, you must
avoid eating fish at all costs!\e"
M04090041,"\h(«Kalifa»)If you do, it will upset your stomach and you
will feel a sickness many times worse than that
caused by air travel.\c"
M04090042,\h(«Kalifa»)… Nothing. I see nothing.\e
M04090043,"\h(«Kalifa»)Well, just consider the gold that you spent as
an investment in your future.\c"
M04090044,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! 
You will travel by air to a faraway land!\e"
M04090045,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oh, sorry. You already did that, didn't you?\c"
M04090046,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!\e"
M04090047,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ancient wisdom will fall because of 
what a young heart feels.\c"
M04090048,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!
I see great danger in your immediate future!\e"
M04090049,"\h(«Kalifa»)A great evil takes many shapes, 
but in reality… it has none.
That is all I can say, for now.\c"
M04090050,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!
But it is cloudy… Perhaps another 10 gold 
tomorrow will clear things up!\e"
M04090051,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hey, fortune tellers have to eat too, you know.
\c"
M04090052,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!
I see a Moon Stone! But, its color is…\e"
M04090053,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hard to see. It's not red. Nor is it purple, 
blue, or green. Nor is it yellow, or silver. 
It's a color that I've never seen.\c"
M04090054,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!\e"
M04090055,"\h(«Kalifa»)There is more to Deep Sky than meets the eye!
Use caution Vyse, there is great evil under the
clouds.\c"
M04090066,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Remember it always and 
the way will be clear to you.\e"
M04090067,"\h(«Kalifa»)I'm very sorry, but you don't have enough gold. 
Come back again later.\c"
M04090068,"\h(«Kalifa»)I see… very well. If you ever need the guidance
of the Red Moon, do not hesitate to return.\c"
M04090069,"\h(«Kalifa»)Remember my words and heed them carefully.
Now go forth and fulfill your destiny.\e"
M04090070,"\h(«Kalifa»)By the way, can you do something with this tent?
It's awfully hard to concentrate in such… 
austere surroundings.\c"
M05030000,"\h(«Merida»)I have heard that the royal family of Valua is
cruel, and the people of Valua are cold-hearted.\e"
M05030001,"\h(«Merida»)But Enrique is so nice. Marco is cute, too. I
think that it is wrong to judge people just
because they come from somewhere else.\c"
M05100000,"\h(«Hans»)I'm learning all about shipbuilding from Brabham
right now.\e"
M05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Brabham is an expert on all kinds of engines, 
from old models to new models, so I've learned
a lot from him! My father would be proud!\e"
M05100002,"\h(«Hans»)He let me read the Yafutoman Book 
on Ship Polarity.\e"
M05100003,"\h(«Hans»)From that, I learned how to build an engine 
using wave motion technology and how to arrange
the sails when flying at extreme heights!\c"
M05100004,"\h(«Hans»)The Great Cloud Sea Engine was quite a job. And 
Brabham is so strict when it comes to work.\e"
M05100005,"\h(«Hans»)He must be tired from all those sleepless 
nights, but he doesn't show it.  He is so 
energetic, especially for his age!\e"
M05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Well, our base is as good as ever.
Now, we just have to prepare for the
assault on Valua.\e"
M05100007,"\h(«Hans»)Did you notice, during the attack, how fast some
of their ships were? Or even that one ship that
was able to fly beneath the clouds?\e"
M05100008,"\h(«Hans»)I wonder why the Valuans only use their 
superior technology to kill people…\c"
M05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse…
It's time for the final battle…\e"
M05100010,"\h(«Hans»)My father's ship, the Ironclad, is ready 
for action, too!\e"
M05100011,"\h(«Hans»)We have finished working on the Delphinus. 
It is ready when you are!\c"
M05210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)Hey Captain, did you know you can 
see the entire island from up here?\e"
M05210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nothing to report today. Well, except for the
fact that Izmael ate Brabham's lunch when he
wasn't looking.\c"
M05210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nothing to report today. Well, except that 
Marco has a stomach ache. I think he 
drank water from the pond…\c"
M05210003,"\h(«Tikatika»)Stay away from the pond. Prince Enrique and 
Princess Moegi are saying their final farewells 
before he leaves. Do not invade their privacy.\c"
M05210004,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nothing to report today. But, I did notice that
Princess Moegi seems to be going to the pond
every day to pray…\c"
M05210005,"\h(«Tikatika»)Welcome back, Captain. I was trying to see where
you were going in that little boat, but…\e"
M05210006,"\h(«Tikatika»)even I could not see. This is the first time
these eyes have failed me. The Great Silver
Shrine must really be high up in the sky…\e"
M05210007,"\h(«Tikatika»)I can't quite see that island that rose up from
under the clouds from here… 
even with my eagle-like eyes.\e"
M05210008,"\h(«Tikatika»)But, I can sense the fear of the birds that come
from the direction of Mid Ocean. I have a very
bad feeling about all of this…\e"
M05210009,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nothing to report today. Heh… I can see 
everyone from here!\e"
M05210010,"\h(«Tikatika»)Everyone is so energetic! I can feel their 
spirit. I'm sure we will win the battle 
against the Armada!\c"
M07060000,"\h(«Don»)When I heard this place used to be a desert
island, I figured it would be even more 
depressing than Esparanza.\e"
M07060001,"\h(«Don»)But, you've got a good variety of food and 
drinks here, and you've assembled quite a crew. 
You're doing a great job!\c"
M07060002,"\h(«Don»)Into Deep Sky, huh? I couldn't even make it 
through the Dark Rift. Now I'm about to sail 
into the underworld with you.\e"
M07060003,"\h(«Don»)Vyse, I gotta tell ya. There's never a dull 
moment when you're around. To say that you are 
inspirational would be an understatement.\e"
M07060004,"\h(«Don»)We all would have made it through the Dark Rift 
if you were around back then.\c"
M07060005,"\h(«Don»)Hey, I really want to hear about the Great
Silver Shrine!\e"
M07060006,"\h(«Don»)While you were off adventuring, I was bustin' 
my butt working on these buildings.\c"
M07060007,"\h(«Don»)Hey, something happened to the Yellow Moon. 
It rained Moon Stones on Valua. Then there were
some explosions.\e"
M07060008,"\h(«Don»)I want to put my past behind me, but 
I'm worried about the Valuans. 
They're not all bad, you know.\c"
M07060009,"\h(«Don»)So, this is it, huh?  
If we all make it back, 
we're going to celebrate!\e"
M07060010,\h(«Don»)I got my bottle of loqua ready!\e
M07060011,"\h(«Don»)Let's get 'em, Vyse!\c"
M08030000,\h(«Urala»)Oh… Vyse. Um… this is a really nice tavern.\e
M08030001,"\h(«Urala»)I wish I could serve Yafutoman food to 
everyone on the island…\e"
M08030002,"\h(«Urala»)But, I guess that's impossible without 
renovating the kitchen…\e"
M08030003,"\h(«Urala»)Oh, don't worry about it. 
I just miss my kitchen back home.\c"
M08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)This is a very beautiful island that you've 
found, Vyse. This pond reminds me of home. 
It's relaxing.\e"
M08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)I wish that I could just sit here like this 
forever…\c"
M08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Something seems to be bothering Prince Enrique…
\e"
M08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)I wish he would tell me what it was. Perhaps 
there is something that I could do to calm him
down…\c"
M08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique, I know your decision is final. 
I… I understand your loyalty and love for your
country.\e"
M08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)I cannot stop you. But… please, return safely
to me. I could not bear the pain if something
were to happen to you…\c"
M08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Ever since the island was attacked, I have 
been worried about Prince Enrique. 
I hope that he is safe…\e"
M08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)I know that he is strong, but he's all alone. 
I am trying to hope for the best, but I fear
the worst.\e"
M08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Please, Prince Enrique, please… 
come back to me.\c"
M08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)I have a really bad feeling about that island 
that rose from Deep Sky.\e"
M08070010,\h(«Moegi»)I get the chills just thinking about it.\c
M08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)I thought I heard Prince Enrique scream
when the Moon Stones fell on Valua.
I hope he is safe.\e"
M08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, you believe that 
Prince Enrique is safe, right?\c"
M08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)I am so happy that Prince Enrique came back 
safely. I don't know what I would have done if 
something happened to him.\c"
M08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, can you please take me with you 
when you fight against the Armada?\e"
M08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)I don't think I can stand being apart from 
Prince Enrique again… \c"
M08070016,\h(«Moegi»)Perhaps I might be able to help in some way…\e
M08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)That old Izmael really is something. 
Just watching him makes me want 
to start building things for you.\e"
M08150001,"\h(«Kirala»)So, how about it? It will cost you some gold,
but I guarantee you a job well done! I can't 
just sit here while Izmael has all the fun!\e"
M08150002,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Ask Kirala to build something.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M08150003,"\h(«Kirala»)Now we're getting somewhere! So, 
which building do you want me to remodel?\e"
M08150004,"\h(«What do you want to remodel?»)“Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”
“Tavern…… 1,500 gold.”\e"
M08150005,"\h(«Kirala»)Now we're getting somewhere! 
Which building do you want me to remodel?\e"
M08150006,"\h(«What do you want to remodel?»)“Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”
“Tavern…… 1,500 gold.”
“Kalifa's Tent…… 1,000 gold.”\e"
M08150007,"\h(«Kirala»)Hey, I might like building things, but I can't
get any work done if I don't have the gold to
buy supplies.\c"
M08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)So, you want to remodel the living quarters?! 
It's gonna cost 2,000 gold to do that… Are 
you sure you want to go through with it?\e"
M08150009,"\h(«Remodel your living quarters?»)“Yeah, go ahead.”
“Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150010,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll have it all fixed 
up for you the next time you come back to the
island.\c"
M08150011,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, you're gonna think things over again? 
Tell me when you make up your mind.\e"
M08150012,"\h(«Kirala»)Hey, I may be good, but I can't do much without 
the gold to pay for everything. Come back later 
when you have enough!\c"
M08150013,"\h(«Kirala»)So, you want to remodel the tavern?  It's gonna
cost 1,500 gold to do that… are you sure you
want to go through with it?\e"
M08150014,"\h(«Remodel the tavern?»)“Yeah, go ahead.”
“Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150015,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll have it all fixed up
for you the next time you come back to the
island.\c"
M08150016,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, you're gonna think things over again? 
Tell me when you make up your mind.\e"
M08150017,"\h(«Kirala»)Hey, I may be good, but I can't do much 
without the gold to pay for everything. 
Come back later when you have enough!\c"
M08150018,"\h(«Kirala»)So, you want to remodel Kalifa's tent?
It's gonna cost 1,000 gold to do that… are you
sure you want to go through with it?\e"
M08150019,"\h(«Remodel Kalifa's tent?»)“Yeah, go ahead.”
“Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150020,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll make her a nicer tent. 
Maybe she'll actually start to give us some 
useful information.\c"
M08150021,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, you're gonna think things over again? 
Tell me when you make up your mind.\e"
M08150022,"\h(«Kirala»)I see…
Well, if you ever change your mind, 
just let me know.\e"
M08150023,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me!  I'll finish my work by the 
time you come back to this island again.\e"
M08150024,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, wait… weren't you already going to have
Izmael remodel that for you?\e"
M08150025,"\h(«Kirala»)If you want, I can remodel it instead.
Is that okay?\e"
M08150026,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Have Izmael remodel it.”
“Have Kirala remodel it.”\e"
M08150027,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that I already asked
Izmael to take care of that.\e"
M08150028,"\h(«Kirala»)Hahaha… it's quite alright.
Well, if you ever want me to remodel it later,
just let me know. I'd be happy to do it.\c"
M08150029,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah… but actually, I was having second
thoughts about the whole thing. I decided that I
want you to remodel it.\e"
M08150030,"\h(«Kirala»)Hahaha… I guess you can't deny true
craftsmanship, huh? I'll just let Izmael
know and I'll get the money from him.\e"
M08150031,"\h(«Kirala»)Leave everything up to me, okay?
I'll show you the beauty of Yafutoman
architecture!\c"
M14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Captain Vyse, your base is done! 
It's not bad considering what I had
to work with here on this island.\e"
M14010001,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow, Izmael, you ARE great! It's hard to believe
that I was marooned here and sleeping in a cave
not too long ago!\e"
M14010002,"\h(«Izmael»)I told you that I'd take care of business! Well 
then, now that I'm finished building our 
headquarters…\e"
M14010003,\h(«Izmael»)I think I'll take up sailing with you guys!\e
M14010004,"\h(«Vyse»)Anyone who can turn a deserted island into 
a fortress is more than welcome!\e"

I'm the greatest builder that ever lived!\e"
M14010006,\h( )Izmael has joined your crew as a “Builder.”\c
M14010007,"\h(«Izmael»)Well, I'm pretty happy with the base, but I 
think I could fix it up a little bit if I 
had more money.\e"
M14010008,"\h(«Izmael»)What do you say? Do you want me to remodel some 
of the buildings?\e"
M14010009,"\h(«Have Izmael remodel a building?»)“That would be great!”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M14010010,\h(«Izmael»)Which building do you want remodeled?\e
M14010011,"\h(«Which do you want to have remodeled?»)“Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”
“Tavern…… 1,500 gold.”\e"
M14010012,\h(«Izmael»)Which building do you want remodeled?\e
M14010013,"\h(«What do you want to remodel?»)“Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”
“Tavern…… 1,500 gold.”
“Kalifa's Tent…… 1,000 gold.”\e"
M14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)Captain, you don't have enough money. I'd do it 
for free, but I need to buy supplies and stuff. 
Come back when you have the gold.\e"
M14010015,"\h(«Izmael»)So, you want to remodel your living quarters? 
It's gonna cost 2,000 gold to do that… are you 
sure you want to go through with it?\e"
M14010016,"\h(«Remodel the living quarters?»)“Go right ahead.”
“Hmm… let me think this over.”\e"
M14010017,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, leave it to me! You'll love what 
I'm going to do to the place! I'll be 
finished when you return to the island.\c"
M14010018,"\h(«Izmael»)That's too bad. If you change your mind, 
just let me know!\e"
M14010019,"\h(«Izmael»)Captain, ya don't have enough money. I'd do it 
for free, but I need to buy supplies and stuff. 
Come back when ya have the gold.\c"
M14010020,"\h(«Izmael»)So, you want to remodel the tavern? It's gonna
cost 1,500 gold to do that… are ya sure you
want to go through with it?\e"
M14010021,"\h(«Remodel the tavern?»)“Go right ahead.”
“Hmm… Let me think this over.”\e"
M14010022,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll take care of everything
by the time ya return to the island.\c"
M14010023,"\h(«Izmael»)That's too bad. If ya change your mind, 
just let me know!\e"
M14010024,"\h(«Izmael»)Captain, ya don't have enough money. I'd do it 
for free, but I need to buy supplies and stuff. 
Come back when ya have the gold.\c"
M14010025,"\h(«Izmael»)So, ya want to remodel Kalifa's tent?
It's gonna cost 1,000 gold to do that… are ya
sure ya want to go through with it?\e"
M14010026,"\h(«Remodel Kalifa's tent?»)“Go right ahead.”
“Hmm… let me think this over.”\e"
M14010027,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll build Kalifa a bigger 
tent by the time ya return to the island again. \c"
M14010028,"\h(«Izmael»)That's too bad. If ya change your mind,
just let me know!\c"
M14010029,"\h(«Izmael»)That's a shame. If ya change your mind,
just let me know!\c"
M14010030,"\h(«Izmael»)Leave it to me!  I'll have the job done by the 
time you come back to this island again!\e"
M14010031,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam bam baaam!
Didn't ya already ask Kirala to remodel that
building for ya?\e"
M14010032,\h(«Izmael»)I could remodel it instead if ya want me to!\e
M14010033,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Have Kirala remodel it.”
“Have Izmael remodel it.”\e"
M14010034,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh… I almost forgot that I had asked Kirala to
do it. Sorry about that, Izmael.\e"
M14010035,"\h(«Izmael»)Ba-bam!
Looks like you're getting forgetful in your old
age there! Hahahaha!\e"
M14010036,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, actually, I was thinking about it and I
want you to remodel it.\e"
M14010037,"\h(«Izmael»)Aye aye!
I'll get to work right away!\e"
M14010038,"\h(«Izmael»)I'll get the money from Kirala. Don't worry
about a thing, okay? Leave everything up to me!
\c"
M14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)I lost everything that was dear to me… 
I lost it all in the Dark Rift.\e"
M14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)…All I had to keep me going were my memories of
Polly.\e"
M14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)It was during those years in the Dark Rift 
that I realized just how important Polly 
was to me.\e"
M14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)I never knew how much I had, until she was gone.
I'm gonna stay by her side until we finish this.
Then we're heading back to Sailors' Island.\c"
M14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)Captain Vyse… I suppose we will be 
heading off to that awful island now…\e"
M14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)We've got to stop Valua from destroying 
everything. Polly and I have our whole 
lives ahead of us.\c"
M14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)We have to win this battle! 
I'll do everything I can to help you!\e"
Mp0010000,"\h(«Aika»)Now that we've got our own island base, 
I bet you finally feel like a real captain.
Captain Vyse… I like the sound of that.\e"
Mp0010001,"\h(«Aika»)You've sailed around the world in your own ship!
Not many people can say that they've made their
childhood dreams come true, you know.\e"
Mp0010002,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika, you make it sound like I'm ready to
retire. There's still so much that I haven't
seen yet.\e"
Mp0010003,"\h(«Vyse»)And there's still lots of undiscovered treasure 
to be found. We've got a long way to go!\e"
Mp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)Haha, that's so like you! Don't worry, 
I'll be right there with you! Especially 
if there's treasure involved.\c"
Mp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)I'll do my best, Captain Vyse. Haha… 
I like the sound of that. It makes me laugh.\c"
Mp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, now that we can go higher and lower than 
we ever have before, we can explore all of the 
places where we haven't been yet!\c"
Mp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)Brabham should be finished working on the
Delphinus by now!\e"
Mp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Let's hurry back to the port, Vyse!\c"
Mp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)I was going to start calling Enrique 
'Prince Pukey,' because he was always 
barfing over the side of the ship…\e"
Mp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)But now, he's become quite a sailor!\e"
Mp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)He'll be okay… Right, Vyse…?\c"
Mp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)When we were kids, remember how everyone
used to describe Deep Sky as a cold, 
dark place where the dead went to rest?\e"
Mp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)I didn't want to believe that my mom and dad 
went to such a horrible place after they died…\e"
Mp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)So, I promised myself that someday, I 
would travel to Deep Sky and see it for 
myself. I wanted to prove everyone wrong.\c"
Mp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)I hope Fina is okay…
She says she is, 
but she looks really sad… \e"
Mp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)Wasn't Elder Prime like a grandfather to her?
Losing him must have been really hard on her.\c"
Mp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)I never thought Galcian would actually 
use the Rains of Destruction!\e"
Mp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)And he did it on his own country, too! 
I can't believe how many people he killed. 
We have to find a way to stop him!\c"
Mp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)So, it all comes down to this battle…
I was really nervous last night, and I didn't
get much sleep.\e"
Mp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)At first, I was scared, but when I thought
about all of the Air Pirates that are here to
fight with us, I started to feel better.\e"
Mp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)Alright, Vyse, everyone's waiting for us at the
Delphinus! Let's hurry back to the port!\c"
Mp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)We really should head back to the Delphinus! 
Everyone is awaiting your orders!\c"
Mp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Good morning, Vyse!
Thanks for that little talk last night.
I was able to relax enough to get some sleep.\e"
Mp0010027,"\h(«Aika»)I know we can beat Galcian. I have faith in
everyone… And I have faith in you.\e"
Mp0010028,"\h(«Aika»)I'd face anyone if you were fighting by my side.
I'm sure the rest of the Air Pirates feel the
same way.\e"
Mp0010029,"\h(«Aika»)Heh heh… Let's do our best.
Everyone's counting on you, Vy… I mean
Cap'n Vyse!!!\c"
Mp0010030,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, we really should head back to the port!
Everyone is waiting for you to lead us into 
battle!\c"
Mp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)I thought everything would be over once we
defeated Galcian, but it looks like I was wrong,
huh?\e"
Mp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)I'm not scared though, since you're 
here with me… and we've 
made it this far together, right?\e"
Mp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)Ok, let's go beat the snot out of Ramirez so we 
can hurry back here to Crescent Isle, and throw 
the biggest party in history!\c"
Mp0020000,"\h(«Fina»)It's… a very nice island. 
And you even had a room 
made for me, too.\e"
Mp0020001,"\h(«Fina»)I can't believe it… I actually have my own room
in your home base…\e"
Mp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)I feel like I am really a member of the Blue 
Rogues. I… I'm so happy. Thank you, Vyse.\e"
Mp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)When we last saw him, Drachma said that
it wasn't going to be easy for him to
start his life over…\e"
Mp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)Do you think he will rejoin us, 
when he feels better?\c"
Mp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)We've finally gathered all of the Moon Crystals.
My mission is finally over.
Thank you for all your help.\c"
Mp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)We can finally get into Deep Sky? 
I don't know much about it. 
I'm a little scared… \e"
Mp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)I suppose it's time to look for my ship…
Thank you for all you've done for me…\c"
Mp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)So, the Delphinus will be able to sail into
Deep Sky… I never dreamed that I'd have to go
down there.\c"
Mp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique is going back to his homeland, Valua…\e"
Mp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)I, too, must return to my homeland once we find
my ship. I… I feel almost as if I don't want to
return.\e"
Mp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)I'm all right. I have decided that I can no
longer waste time lamenting over the change that
has occurred in Ramirez. He must be stopped.\e"
Mp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez and I… We were both raised by the
Elders in the Great Silver Shrine.\e"
Mp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)Among the Elders, Elder Prime was the most
knowledgeable. He knew everything, from 
historical records to current world affairs.\e"
Mp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez was always the most interested in 
Elder Prime's stories about the Chronicles 
of Arcadia. They'd spend hours together.\e"
Mp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)I think it was Elder Prime's stories that
inspired Ramirez to search for the Crystals. 
I can't believe Ramirez… killed him… \c"
Mp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, so many people were killed when 
the Rain of Destruction fell on Valua.\e"
Mp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez and the Silver Gigas, Zelos, are 
responsible for this.\e"
Mp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)As a Silvite,
I… I should have stopped Ramirez… \c"
Mp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)The time has come at last to face Ramirez.
To be completely honest, it… it's a little hard
for me to fight against him.\e"
Mp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)But, as a Silvite… I must stop him. 
It is my duty. \e"
Mp0020023,"\h(«Fina»)I'll do my best. We must not let
Galcian and Ramirez destroy this world.\c"
Mp0020024,"\h(«Fina»)Galcian and Ramirez must be stopped, 
before more innocent lives are lost.\c"
Mp0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Good morning, Vyse.
Um… thank you for everything last night.\e"
Mp0020026,"\h(«Fina»)To be completely honest, it's a little hard for
me to fight against Ramirez. But…\e"
Mp0020027,"\h(«Fina»)I want to fight. I want to help save this world.
I… I want to fight along side of you.\e"
Mp0020028,"\h(«Fina»)That's why I'll try my best. As long as you are
there fighting with me, somehow I believe we'll
win.\c"
Mp0020029,"\h(«Fina»)Let's go, Vyse. Everyone is probably waiting at
the Delphinus for us.\c"
Mp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Let's go Vyse, we've got to stop Ramirez. \e"
Mp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)For the sake of this world… and for the memory
of Elder Prime, Ramirez must be stopped.\c"
Mp0040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Hello, Vyse. For a hidden base, 
this is most impressive.\e"
Mp0040001,"\h(«Enrique»)As we acquire more crew members, 
the base, as well as the Delphinus,
will run more smoothly.\e"
Mp0040002,"\h(«Enrique»)You are the only one who has the experience 
and the determination to lead this crew to 
victory. We all look up to you, Vyse!\e"
Mp0040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, I have entrusted you with the 
Delphinus. Please take good care of it,
I may want it back someday.\c"
Mp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)As a Prince of Valua, I knew that someday I 
would eventually return to Valua, but I never
thought I'd have to return from underneath it.\c"
Mp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)We have obtained all the Moon Crystals at last. 
Now I can finally put an end to my mother's
tyranny.\e"
Mp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Although we fight on opposing sides,
she is still my mother.\e"
Mp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)I hope that I can convince her that what she is 
doing is wrong, and we can come to some
agreement.\c"
Mp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse… I'm sorry but could you leave me alone 
for a while?\e"
Mp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)The modifications on the Delphinus should be
complete. Let us return to the port, Vyse.\c"
Mp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Don't give me that worried look of yours. 
I promise you that I will come back. 
Heh… I'm not quite ready to die yet.\e"
Mp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)I… I just have one request to ask of you, Vyse.
Please… look after Princess Moegi while I am
gone. She… she means so much to me.\c"
Mp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)So, it's time to confront Galcian. I shall 
accompany you in the Delphinus.\e"
Mp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Galcian must pay for destroying my 
homeland, and killing my mother… 
and Gregorio…\c"
Mp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)This is it… If we win, the world will 
be at peace. We must win this battle!\e"
Mp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Let's go, Vyse… No, Captain Vyse!
Lead us to victory!\c"
MS01000000,"\h(«Polly»)No está mal este sitio. Me recuerda un poco a mi
taberna de Isla Los Marinos.\e"
MS01000001,\h(«Polly»)Creo que aquí puedo cocinar……\e
MS01000002,"\h(«Polly»)Pero la cocina necesita unos arreglos.
Habrá que remodelarla, si no me será imposible
cocinar mis populares platos.\c"
MS01000003,"\h(«Polly»)Si me dejáis remodelar este sitio, puedo abrir
una taberna en esta isla.\c"
MS01140000,"\h(«Pinta»)¡Me encanta esta isla! ¡Y encima está bien
situada! Es un buen punto de partida para buscar
todo tipo de aventuras.\e"

¡Ni que el resto del mundo fuera tan grande!\e"
MS02000001,"\h(«Marco»)Después de tu pequeña charla, quiero conocer el
mundo entero. ¡Gracias, Vyse! ¡Estoy impaciente
por volver a navegar!\c"
MS02000002,"\h(«Marco»)Anda…… Lo que más me sorprendió al irme de Valua
fue el cielo…… Es azul.
Nunca había visto el cielo azul……\e"
MS02000003,"\h(«Marco»)¡Y las nubes son blancas! ¡Creía que serían
oscuras como las de Valua!\e"
MS02000004,"\h(«Marco»)¡No os riáis! ¡Si hubierais estado en el Arrabal
de Valua toda vuestra vida, lo entenderíais!\c"
MS02000005,\h(«Marco»)¿Qué tal va el nuevo motor del barco?\e
MS02000006,"\h(«Marco»)Eh…… Quién iba a pensar que me convertiría en
mecánico…… ¡He ayudado a construir eso!
Y la verdad, he hecho un buen trabajo.\c"
MS02000007,"\h(«Marco»)¡Bienvenido, Vyse! ¿A que te has sorprendido de
encontrar todo terminado en la isla?\e"
MS02000008,"\h(«Marco»)¡También le he ayudado mucho a Izmael! Bueno……
¡sólo he pintado las paredes, pero aun
así era mucho trabajo!\c"
MS02000009,"\h(«Marco»)Chicos, habéis visto las estrellas fugaces que
ha habido en Valua, ¿no?\e"
MS02000010,"\h(«Marco»)Desde entonces, Aika y tú parecéis tristes.
¿Qué pasa? ¿Ha ocurrido algo malo?\c"
MS02000011,"\h(«Marco»)La Armada hizo que las Piedras Lunares cayeran
sobre Valua, ¿es eso?\e"
MS02000012,"\h(«Marco»)No…… No me gustaba ese sitio, pero…… crecí allí.
Me entristece que haya desaparecido todo.\e"
MS02000013,"\h(«Marco»)Vyse, me tienes que prometer que venceremos a la
Armada. No podemos dejarles escapar después de
todo lo que han hecho.\c"
MS02000014,"\h(«Marco»)Tenemos que detenerles antes de que destruyan
los demás países. Aún me queda mucho por ver.\c"

porvenir……\e"

“Mejor otro día.”\e"

MS04090005,\h(«Kalifa»)¡¡¡Ahhh!!!\e
MS04090006,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo! ¡Debes masticar bien la
comida antes de tragar!\e"

fácil hacer la digestión.\c"
MS04090008,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo! ¡Tener un bajo “Rango de
Bucanero” va a afectar a tu misión!\e"
MS04090009,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Con un rango bajo, es más fácil huir de las
batallas e incluso evitarlas por completo!\c"
MS04090010,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo! Mmm…… Mañana va a estar
nublado en algunas zonas y hay posibilidades de
lluvia.\e"

dejéis secar dentro!\c"
MS04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo! ¡Tener un “Rango de

¡Tu habilidad en la batalla dependerá de tu
habilidad de liderazgo!\c"

una niña que se llama Lindsi…… ¡Oh, no!
Está jugando en el puerto y…… y……\e"
MS04090015,\h(«Kalifa»)…… ¡Se le ha clavado una astilla en el dedo!\c

en las situaciones desesperadas.\c"

hilo. Tienes que ser fuerte, porque el destino

batallas, se correrá la voz sobre tu valentía
entre la gente.\e"

adversarios, la gente hablará de tu
cobardía. Sé prudente en tus acciones.\c"

MS04090039,"\h(«Kalifa»)Si le das un Chom, Cupil regurgitará todos los
Chams que haya comido hasta ese momento.
Debes usarlos con prudencia.\c"
MS04090040,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo! ¡Esta noche debes evitar
comer pescado a toda costa!\e"
MS04090041,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Si lo haces, te irritará el estómago y te
encontrarás mucho peor que en el peor de tus
viajes!\c"
MS04090042,\h(«Kalifa»)…… Nada. No veo nada.\e
MS04090043,"\h(«Kalifa»)Bueno, considera el oro que te has gastado como
una inversión en tu futuro.\c"
MS04090044,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo!
¡Viajas por el cielo hacia una tierra lejana!\e"
MS04090045,"\h(«Kalifa»)Uy, perdona. Eso ya lo has hecho, ¿no?\c"
MS04090046,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo!\e"
MS04090047,"\h(«Kalifa»)La sabiduría antigua va a ser destronada por los
sentimientos de un corazón joven.\c"
MS04090048,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo!
¡Veo un gran peligro en tu futuro inmediato!\e"
MS04090049,"\h(«Kalifa»)El mal adopta muchas formas,
pero en realidad…… no tiene ninguna.
Eso es todo lo que puedo decirte por ahora.\c"
MS04090050,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo!
Pero está borroso…… ¡si me traes otras 10
piezas de oro mañana, se aclarará un poco!\e"
MS04090051,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oye, las adivinas también tenemos que
ganarnos la vida para comer.\c"
MS04090052,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo!
¡Veo una Piedra Lunar! Pero su color es……\e"
MS04090053,"\h(«Kalifa»)Es difícil de ver. No es rojo, ni púrpura, ni
azul, ni verde, ni amarillo y tampoco de plata.
Es un color que no había visto nunca.\c"
MS04090054,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo!\e"
MS04090055,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡En el Cielo Profundo hay más de lo que parece!
Sé prudente, Vyse, bajo esas nubes acecha un mal
terrible.\c"
MS04090066,"\h(«Kalifa»)La Luna Roja ha hablado. Recuérdalo siempre y te
ayudará en el camino.\e"
MS04090067,"\h(«Kalifa»)Lo siento mucho, pero no te llega el oro.
Vuelve luego.\c"
MS04090068,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ya veo…… vale. Si alguna vez necesitas el
consejo de la Luna Roja, no dudes en volver.\c"
MS04090069,"\h(«Kalifa»)Recuerda mis palabras y sigue su consejo.
Ahora vete y cumple con tu destino.\e"
MS04090070,"\h(«Kalifa»)Por cierto, ¿podrías hacer algo con esta tienda?
Es dificilísimo concentrarse en semejante……
entorno.\c"
MS05030000,"\h(«Merida»)He oído que los miembros de la Familia Real de
Valua son crueles y que las gentes de Valua son
unos seres desalmados.\e"
MS05030001,"\h(«Merida»)Pero Enrique es muy simpático. Y Marco también
es mono. Creo que no se puede juzgar a la gente
sólo porque viene de otro país.\c"
MS05100000,"\h(«Hans»)Ahora mismo Brabham me está enseñando todo sobre
la construcción de barcos.\e"
MS05100001,"\h(«Hans»)¡Brabham es un gran experto en motores, de
modelos viejos o nuevos, así que he aprendido
mucho! ¡Mi padre estaría orgulloso de mí!\e"
MS05100002,\h(«Hans»)Me ha dejado leer el Libro del Polo Yafutoman.\e
MS05100003,"\h(«Hans»)¡Con ese libro aprendí a construir un motor de
tecnología del movimiento de las ondas y a
arreglar las velas a gran altitud!\c"
MS05100004,"\h(«Hans»)El Motor del Mar de Grandes Nubes fue un duro
trabajo. Brabham es muy estricto cuando se trata
de trabajo.\e"
MS05100005,"\h(«Hans»)Debe estar cansado después de tantas noches sin
dormir, pero no lo demuestra. ¡Tiene mucha
vitalidad para una persona de su edad!\e"
MS05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Bueno, nuestra base está mejor que nunca.
Ahora sólo tenemos que prepararnos para asaltar
Valua.\e"
MS05100007,"\h(«Hans»)¿Os habéis dado cuenta en la batalla de lo
rápidos que eran sus barcos? ¿Y qué me decís del
barco que podía volar bajo las nubes?\e"
MS05100008,"\h(«Hans»)Me pregunto por qué los Valuan sólo usan su
fabulosa tecnología para matar……\c"
MS05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse……
Ha llegado la hora de la batalla final……\e"
MS05100010,"\h(«Hans»)¡El navío de mi padre, el Acorazado, está listo
para la acción!\e"
MS05100011,"\h(«Hans»)Hemos terminado de arreglar el Delphinus.
¡Está listo para cuando queráis!\c"
MS05210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)Capitán, ¿sabe que desde aquí se puede ver la
isla entera?\e"
MS05210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nada nuevo hoy. Lo único interesante es que
Izmael se ha comido el almuerzo de Brabham
cuando él no miraba.\c"
MS05210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nada nuevo hoy tampoco. Bueno, a excepción del
dolor de estómago de Marco. Creo que ha bebido
agua del estanque……\c"
MS05210003,"\h(«Tikatika»)Que nadie se acerque al estanque. El Príncipe
Enrique y la Princesa Moegi están despidiéndose.
Es un momento íntimo.\c"
MS05210004,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nada nuevo hoy tampoco. Lo que sí he notado es
que la Princesa Moegi va al estanque todos los
días a rezar……\c"
MS05210005,"\h(«Tikatika»)Bienvenido, Capitán. Estaba intentando averiguar
adónde ibais en ese pequeño bote, pero……\e"
MS05210006,"\h(«Tikatika»)Ni siquiera yo lo pude ver. Es la primera vez
que me falla la vista. El Gran Relicario de
Plata debe estar a gran altitud……\e"
MS05210007,"\h(«Tikatika»)Casi no puedo ver la isla que salió de
debajo de las nubes……
Ni con mis ojos de águila.\e"
MS05210008,"\h(«Tikatika»)Pero percibo que los pájaros que vienen del
Océano están asustados. Me da muy mala espina
todo esto……\e"
MS05210009,"\h(«Tikatika»)Sin novedades. Eh…… ¡Desde aquí veo a todo el
mundo!\e"
MS05210010,"\h(«Tikatika»)¡La gente trabaja sin parar! Puedo sentir su
vitalidad. ¡Estoy convencido de ganaremos la
batalla contra la Armada!\c"
MS07060000,"\h(«Don»)Cuando oí que este sitio antes era una isla
desierta, pensé que sería aún más deprimente que
Esperanza.\e"
MS07060001,"\h(«Don»)Pero aquí hay una gran variedad de comidas y
bebidas, y has formado una gran tripulación.
¡Has hecho un gran trabajo!\c"
MS07060002,"\h(«Don»)Al Cielo Profundo, ¿eh? Ni siquiera logré cruzar
la Gruta Oscura. Y ahora estoy a punto de irme a
navegar hacia el submundo.\e"
MS07060003,"\h(«Don»)Vyse, tengo que contarte algo. Cuando tú
estás presente, nunca me aburro. Decir que me
siento inspirado por ti no sería exagerar.\e"
MS07060004,"\h(«Don»)Si tú hubieras estado con nosotros en aquella
época, todos habríamos conseguido pasar por la
Gruta Oscura.\c"
MS07060005,"\h(«Don»)¡Me lo tienes que contar todo sobre el Gran
Relicario de Plata!\e"
MS07060006,"\h(«Don»)Mientras estabas por ahí de aventuras, yo estaba
aquí rompiéndome las espaldas.\c"
MS07060007,"\h(«Don»)Algo ha pasado con la Luna Amarilla. Llovieron
Piedras Lunares sobre Valua y luego hubo varias
explosiones.\e"
MS07060008,"\h(«Don»)Quiero olvidar el pasado, pero los Valuans
siguen preocupándome.
No todos son malos, sabes.\c"
MS07060009,"\h(«Don»)Así que ha llegado el momento, ¿eh?
¡Si conseguimos volver,
la fiesta será sonada!\e"
MS07060010,\h(«Don»)¡Tengo mi botella de loqua preparada!\e
MS07060011,"\h(«Don»)¡A por ellos, Vyse!\c"
MS08030000,\h(«Urala»)Oh…… Vyse. Esto…… Qué taberna tan bonita.\e
MS08030001,"\h(«Urala»)Ojalá pudiera cocinar platos Yafutoman para
todos los de la isla……\e"
MS08030002,"\h(«Urala»)Pero eso va a ser imposible sin antes renovar la
cocina……\e"
MS08030003,"\h(«Urala»)Es igual, no te preocupes.
Es que echo de menos mi cocina de casa.\c"
MS08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Has buscado una isla muy mona, Vyse. Este
estanque me recuerda a mi hogar.
Es muy relajante.\e"
MS08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)Me encantaría quedarme aquí sentada para
siempre……\c"
MS08070002,\h(«Moegi»)Algo le preocupa al Príncipe Enrique……\e
MS08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Ojalá me contara lo que le pasa. A lo mejor
puedo hacer algo para tranquilizarse un poco……\c"
MS08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Príncipe Enrique, sé que tu decisión está
tomada. Yo…… entiendo tu lealtad y cariño hacia
tu país.\e"
MS08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)No puedo detenerte. Pero…… por favor, vuelve
pronto. No podría soportar el sufrimiento si te
sucediera algo……\c"
MS08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Desde el día en que atacaron la isla, he estado
preocupada por el Príncipe Enrique.
Espero que no esté en peligro……\e"
MS08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Sé que es una persona fuerte, pero está muy
solo. Deseo que suceda lo mejor, pero me temo lo
peor.\e"
MS08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Por favor, Príncipe Enrique……
Vuelve pronto conmigo.\c"
MS08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Me da muy mala espina esa isla que ha surgido
del Cielo Profundo.\e"
MS08070010,\h(«Moegi»)Me dan escalofríos sólo de pensar en ella.\c
MS08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Me pareció oír los gritos del Príncipe Enrique
cuando cayeron las Piedras Lunares sobre
Valua. Espero que no le haya pasado nada.\e"
MS08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Capitán Vyse, ¿crees que el Príncipe Enrique
estará a salvo?\c"
MS08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)Estoy tan contenta de que el Príncipe Enrique
volviera sano y salvo. No sé lo que habría sido
de mí si le hubiera pasado algo.\c"
MS08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Capitán Vyse, ¿podrías llevarme contigo cuando
vayas a luchar contra la Armada?\e"
MS08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)No creo que pudiera soportar separarme de nuevo
del Príncipe Enrique……\c"
MS08070016,\h(«Moegi»)Es posible que pueda ayudar de alguna forma……\e
MS08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)El viejo Izmael es tremendo.
Sólo de mirarlo me dan ganas de empezar a
construir para ti.\e"
MS08150001,"\h(«Kirala»)¿Qué me dices entonces? ¡Te va a costar un poco
de oro, pero te garantizo que será un trabajo
bien hecho! ¡No puedo quedarme aquí pasmado
mientras Izmael hace todo lo divertido!\e"

que remodele?\e"
MS08150004,"\h(«¿Qué quieres remodelar?»)“Viviendas…… 2.000 piezas de oro.”

que remodelar?\e"
MS08150006,"\h(«¿Qué vas a remodelar?»)“Viviendas…… 2.000 piezas de oro.”
“Taberna…… 1.500 piezas de oro.”
“Tienda de Kalifa…… 1.000 piezas de oro.”\e"
MS08150007,"\h(«Kirala»)Mira, me gustaría construir cosas, pero no puedo
terminar nada si no tengo oro para comprar los
materiales.\c"
MS08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)¡¿Así que quieres remodelar las viviendas?!
Eso te va a costar 2.000 piezas de oro……
¿Estás seguro de que quieres hacerlo?\e"

“Esto…… voy a pensármelo.”\e"

a la isla lo tendré todo arreglado.\c"

Cuando te decidas me lo dices.\e"
MS08150012,"\h(«Kirala»)Mira, por muy bueno que sea no puedo hacer nada
si no me das oro para comprar las cosas.
¡Vuelve cuando tengas suficiente!\c"
MS08150013,"\h(«Kirala»)¿Que quieres remodelar la taberna? Eso te va a
salir por 1.500 piezas de oro…… ¿Seguro que
quieres seguir adelante?\e"

“Mmm…… me lo voy a pensar.”\e"
MS08150020,"\h(«Kirala»)¡Déjamelo a mí! Le haré una tienda más bonita.
A lo mejor así nos da información un poco más
útil.\c"

Cuando te decidas me lo dices.\e"
MS08150022,"\h(«Kirala»)Ya……
Si alguna vez cambias de opinión,
me lo dices.\e"
MS08150023,"\h(«Kirala»)¡Tú déjamelo a mí! Para cuando hayas vuelto a
la isla, ya habré terminado.\e"
MS08150024,"\h(«Kirala»)Un momento…… ¿no le habías pedido ya a Izmael
que se encargara de remodelar eso para ti?\e"
MS08150025,"\h(«Kirala»)Si quieres, lo puedo remodelar yo en su lugar.
¿Qué te parece?\e"
MS08150026,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Que Izmael lo remodele.”
“Que Kirala lo remodele.”\e"
MS08150027,"\h(«Vyse»)Lo siento. Se me olvidó que ya le había
pedido a Izmael que se encargara de eso.\e"
MS08150028,"\h(«Kirala»)Ja, ja…… pues muy bien.
Si cambias de opinión, no dudes en decírmelo.
Me encantaría hacerlo.\c"
MS08150029,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí…… pero la verdad es que tenía serias dudas
sobre el asunto. Y he decidido que quiero que lo
remodeles tú.\e"
MS08150030,"\h(«Kirala»)Ja, ja…… Supongo que sabes apreciar el talento
verdadero, ¿no? Yo se lo cuento a Izmael y de
paso le digo que me dé el dinero.\e"

No está mal si tiene en cuenta con lo que he
tenido que trabajar en esta isla.\e"

no hace mucho yo estaba viviendo aquí aislado y

MSp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)Al principio tenía miedo, pero cuando pienso en
todos los Piratas Aéreos que han venido para
luchar con nosotros, ya me siento mejor.\e"
MSp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)¡Muy bien, Vyse, la gente nos espera en el
Delphinus! ¡Volvamos al puerto, rápido!\c"
MSp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)¡Tenemos que volver al Delphinus cuanto antes!
¡Todos esperan tus órdenes!\c"
MSp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)¡Buenos días, Vyse!
Gracias por quedarte a charlar conmigo anoche.
Al final me tranquilicé y pude dormir.\e"
MSp0010027,"\h(«Aika»)Sé que podemos vencer a Galcian. Tengo gran fe
en todos…… Y confío en ti.\e"
MSp0010028,"\h(«Aika»)Si tú estás a mi lado podré enfrentarme a quien
sea. Y sé que los demás Piratas Aéreos sienten
lo mismo que yo.\e"
MSp0010029,"\h(«Aika»)Eh…… eh…… Vamos a hacerlo lo mejor que sepamos.
Todos cuentan contigo, Vy…… ¡¡¡quiero decir,
Capitán Vyse!!!\c"
MSp0010030,"\h(«Aika»)¡Vyse, tenemos que ir al puerto cuanto antes!
¡Todos esperan a que nos dirijas en la batalla!\c"
MSp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)Cuando derrotamos a Galcian pensé que todo esto
había terminado, pero parece que me equivocaba,
¿eh?\e"
MSp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)No tengo miedo si estás aquí conmigo……
Hemos llegado hasta aquí por tenernos el uno al
otro, ¿no crees?\e"
MSp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)Muy bien, ¡vamos a darle una buena tunda a
Ramírez y volveremos a la Isla de la Luna a
celebrarlo a lo grande!\c"
MSp0020000,"\h(«Fina»)Es…… una isla muy bonita.
Y habéis construido una habitación para mí
también.\e"
MSp0020001,"\h(«Fina»)No puedo creerlo…… Tengo mi propia habitación en
tu base……\e"
MSp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)Me siento como si fuera una de vosotros, una más
de los Bandidos Azules. Soy…… soy tan feliz.
Gracias, Vyse.\e"
MSp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)La última vez que le vimos, Drachma dijo que no
iba a ser fácil empezar una vida nueva……\e"
MSp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)¿Crees que se nos unirá,
cuando se encuentre mejor de ánimo?\c"
MSp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)Por fin hemos conseguido reunir todos los
Cristales Lunares.
Mi misión ha terminado.
Os agradezco toda vuestra ayuda.\c"
MSp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)¿Por fin podemos ir al Cielo Profundo?
No sé mucho sobre él. Tengo miedo……\e"
MSp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)Ha llegado el momento de buscar mi navío……
Muchas gracias por todo lo que habéis hecho por
mí……\e"
MSp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Así que el Delphinus podrá navegar por el
Cielo Profundo…… Jamás pensé que iría a las
profundidades del cielo.\c"
MSp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique va a regresar a su tierra, Valua……\e"
MSp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Yo también debo regresar a mi tierra
cuando encuentre mi navío…… casi no me apetece
volver.\e"
MSp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)Estoy bien. Me he dado cuenta de que no puedo
perder más el tiempo, lamentando que Ramírez
haya cambiado tanto. Tenemos que detenerle.\e"
MSp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)Ramírez y yo…… Fuimos criados por los Ancianos
en el Gran Relicario de Plata.\e"
MSp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)El más sabio era el Gran Anciano.
Lo sabía todo, los más remotos hechos históricos
y los asuntos de mayor actualidad.\e"
MSp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Lo que más le interesaba a Ramírez eran
Crónicas de Arcadia que el Gran Anciano le
contaba. Se pasaba las horas escuchándole.\e"
MSp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Creo que Ramírez fue en busca de los Cristales
por las historias del Gran Anciano.
No puedo creer que Ramírez…… le matara……\c"
MSp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, murió tanta gente cuando las
Lluvias Destructoras cayeron sobre Valua.\e"
MSp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Ramírez y Zelos, el Gigas de Plata, fueron los
responsables.\e"
MSp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Como Silvite,
debería haber detenido a Ramírez……\c"
MSp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Ha llegado el momento de enfrentarse a Ramírez.
Si te soy totalmente sincera, me resulta muy
difícil luchar contra él.\e"
MSp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)Pero, como Silvite…… tengo que detenerle.
Es mi deber.\e"
MSp0020023,"\h(«Fina»)Lo voy intentar. No podemos permitir que Galcian
y Ramírez arrasen el mundo entero.\c"
MSp0020024,"\h(«Fina»)Hay que detener a Galcian y Ramírez
antes de que mueran más inocentes.\c"
MSp0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Buenos días, Vyse.
Esto…… gracias por todo lo de anoche.\e"
MSp0020026,"\h(«Fina»)Ha llegado el momento de enfrentarse a Ramírez.
Si te soy totalmente sincera, me resulta muy
duro luchar contra él.\e"
MSp0020027,"\h(«Fina»)Pero quiero hacerlo. Quiero salvar al mundo.
Quiero…… quiero luchar junto a ti.\e"
MSp0020028,"\h(«Fina»)Por eso voy a esforzarme. Mientras tú luches a
mi lado, sabré que la victoria es nuestra.\c"
MSp0020029,"\h(«Fina»)Vamos, Vyse. Los demás deben estar esperándonos
en el Delphinus.\c"
MSp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Vamos, Vyse, debemos detener a Ramírez.\e"
MSp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)Por el futuro de este mundo…… y por la memoria
del Gran Anciano, debemos detener a Ramírez.\c"
MSp0040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Hola, Vyse. Para ser una base oculta,
es de lo más imponente.\e"
MSp0040001,"\h(«Enrique»)Cuantos más miembros en la tripulación, en
nuestra base y en el Delphinus, todo funcionará
mejor.\e"
MSp0040002,"\h(«Enrique»)Eres el único con la suficiente experiencia y
decisión para llevar a esta tripulación a la
victoria. ¡Todos te admiramos, Vyse!\e"
MSp0040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, te he confiado el Delphinus. Cuídalo, a lo
mejor me lo tienes que devolver algún día.\c"
MSp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Como Príncipe de Valua, sabía que algún día
tendría que regresar allí, pero nunca hubiera
imaginado que lo haría desde abajo.\c"
MSp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Por fin hemos conseguido todos los Cristales
Lunares. Por fin podemos poner fin a la tiranía
de mi madre.\e"
MSp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Aunque luchemos en bandos enemigos,
sigue siendo mi madre.\e"
MSp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Espero poder convencerla de que su equivocación
y que podamos alcanzar algún acuerdo.\c"
MSp0040008,\h(«Vyse»)Vyse…… ¿Podría estar a solas un rato?\e
MSp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Las modificaciones del Delphinus deben haber
terminado. Vamos a volver al puerto, Vyse.\c"
MSp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)No me mires con esa cara de preocupación.
Te prometo que volveré pronto.
Todavía no estoy preparado para morir.\e"
MSp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)Sólo te pido una cosa, Vyse.
Mientras esté fuera cuida…… de la Princesa
Moegi. Ella…… significa mucho para mí.\c"
MSp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Así que ha llegado el momento de enfrentarse a
Galcian. Iré con vosotros en el Delphinus.\e"
MSp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Galcian debe pagar por devastar mi país y matar
a mi madre…… y a Gregorio……\c"
MSp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)Ha llegado el gran momento…… Si ganamos, en el
mundo reinará la paz. ¡Tenemos que ganar esta
batalla!\e"
MSp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Vamos, Vyse…… No, ¡Capitán Vyse!
¡Condúcenos a la victoria!\c"
MF01000000,"\h(«Polly»)C'est pas trop mal ici. Cela me rappelle un peu
ma taverne sur l'Île des Marins.\e"
MF01000001,\h(«Polly»)Je pense que j'arriverai à cuisiner ici……\e
MF01000002,"\h(«Polly»)Mais, la cuisine a besoin d'être réorganisée,
si je veux cuisiner les meilleurs plats.\c"
MF01000003,"\h(«Polly»)Si vous me laissez réorganiser cette cuisine,
je pourrai ouvrir une taverne sur votre île.\c"
MF01140000,"\h(«Pinta»)Cette île est vraiment belle ! Et le cadre aussi
est très agréable ! Nous pourrons certainement
partir vivre toutes sortes d'aventures.\e"
MF02000000,"\h(«Marco»)Je ne pensais pas sortir de Valua un jour.
Et je ne savais pas que le reste du monde était
aussi vaste !\e"
MF02000001,"\h(«Marco»)Votre petit discours m'a donné envie d'explorer
le monde. Merci Vyse !
Il me tarde de repartir naviguer !\c"
MF02000002,"\h(«Marco»)Ma plus grosse surprise après être sorti de
Valua, je crois que c'était le ciel…… Il est
bleu. C'est la première fois que je vois un ciel
bleu……\e"
MF02000003,"\h(«Marco»)Et les nuages sont blancs ! Je croyais qu'ils
étaient noirs comme ceux de Valua !\e"
MF02000004,"\h(«Marco»)Arrêtez de rire ! Si vous aviez vécu à Bas
Valua, vous sauriez de quoi je parle !\c"
MF02000005,"\h(«Marco»)Alors est-ce que le nouveau moteur fonctionne
bien ?\e"
MF02000006,"\h(«Marco»)Qui aurait cru que je deviendrais ingénieur……
Dire que j'ai participé à la construction de ce
navire ! J'ai fait du bon travail si j'ose
dire.\c"
MF02000007,"\h(«Marco»)Bienvenue, Vyse ! Je parie que vous avez été
surpris de voir que tout était reconstruit sur
l'île, non ?\e"
MF02000008,"\h(«Marco»)J'ai bien aidé Izmael ! Bon, d'accord…… J'ai
seulement peint les murs, mais il y avait quand
même beaucoup de travail !\c"
MF02000009,"\h(«Marco»)Vous avez vu les étoiles filantes qui tombaient
sur Valua, non ?\e"
MF02000010,"\h(«Marco»)Depuis ce jour, vous et Aika avez l'air
inquiets. Qu'avez-vous ? Est-ce qu'il est arrivé
un malheur ?\c"
MF02000011,"\h(«Marco»)L'Armada a déclenché une pluie de Pierres de
Lune sur Valua, hein ?\e"
MF02000012,"\h(«Marco»)Je…… je n'aimais pas tellement cet endroit,
mais…… j'y ai grandi. Cela me rend triste de
penser qu'il a été détruit.\e"
MF02000013,"\h(«Marco»)Vyse, promettez-moi de vaincre l'Armada.
Il ne faut pas les laisser s'en tirer comme
cela.\c"
MF02000014,"\h(«Marco»)Il faut les empêcher de détruire tous les autres
pays. Il me reste tant de choses à voir.\c"
MF04090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Bienvenue. Écoutez-moi bien et l'avenir vous
sera révélé……\e"
MF04090001,"\h(«Voulez-vous connaître votre avenir ?»)“Vous paierez 10 pièces d'or pour le connaître.”
“Peut-être une autre fois.”\e"
MF04090002,\h( )Vous avez donné 10 pièces d'or à Kalifa.\e
MF04090003,"\h(«Kalifa»)Très bien.
Commençons.\e"
MF04090004,\h(«Kalifa»)Hummm……\e
MF04090005,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa !!!\e
MF04090006,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose !
Souvenez-vous de bien mâcher avant d'avaler !\e"
MF04090007,"\h(«Kalifa»)Cela vous évitera de vous étouffer et cela
facilite la digestion.\c"
MF04090008,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Si vous avez
un “taux de fiers-à-bras” bas, votre mission en
sera affectée !\e"
MF04090009,"\h(«Kalifa»)Si vous avez un taux bas, vous aurez plus de
facilité à fuir les batailles et même à les
éviter !\c"
MF04090010,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Humm…… On
dirait que demain il y aura quelques nuages et
il risque de pleuvoir par endroits.\e"
MF04090011,"\h(«Kalifa»)Alors, si vous avez mis du linge à sécher
dehors, vous feriez mieux de le rentrer !\c"
MF04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Si votre
“taux de fiers-à-bras” est élevé, cela affectera
le moral de votre équipage au sens positif.\e"
MF04090013,"\h(«Kalifa»)Vous ferez aussi preuve de bravoure à la
bataille ! Plus vous serez un bon leader et plus
vous saurez vous battre !\c"
MF04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Sur…… l'Île
des Pirates…… la petite Lindsi…… Oh, non ! Elle
sera en train de jouer sur les docks et…… et……\e"
MF04090015,"\h(«Kalifa»)…… et elle se plantera une écharde dans le
doigt !\c"
MF04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Une femme
qui travaillait dans une taverne et un homme
assis seul en silence seront réunis !\e"
MF04090017,"\h(«Kalifa»)Et ils vivront heureux après avoir été unis par
les liens du mariage. Une si jolie fin……\c"
MF04090018,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose !
4 est votre numéro porte-bonheur.
Votre couleur porte-bonheur est…… umm…… le
bleu.\e"
MF04090019,"\h(«Kalifa»)Les couples devraient sortir plus souvent !
L'air frais et les beaux paysages peuvent avoir
un effet vivifiant……\c"
MF04090020,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Sur l'Île des
Marins, il y a des objets rares à vendre.\e"
MF04090021,"\h(«Kalifa»)Alors n'oubliez pas d'aller voir aussi souvent
que possible ce que le marchand a à vendre !\c"
MF04090022,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Vous ferez
beaucoup de rencontres au cours de vos voyages.
Et vous séparerez aussi de beaucoup de gens……\e"
MF04090023,"\h(«Kalifa»)……Quoi ? Vous dites que cela peut arriver à tout
le monde ?! Sceptique ! Il faut apprendre à
accepter votre destin.
Ainsi vous comprendrez le but de votre vie.\c"
MF04090024,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Dans ce
monde, il existe 3 Chams spéciaux appelés
“Chams Abirik.”\e"
MF04090025,"\h(«Kalifa»)On ne sait jamais qui nous les donnera, alors
soyez gentils avec les gens…… ils vous en feront
peut-être cadeau.\c"
MF04090026,"\h(«Kalifa»)Les techniques de défense ne durent qu'un tour,
mais l'effet est garanti.\e"
MF04090027,"\h(«Kalifa»)Alors, si vous pouvez anticiper les attaques de
vos ennemis, vous pourrez les rendre
impuissants.\c"
MF04090028,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Une fois que
vous serez le capitaine de votre propre navire
et que vos Esprits seront au maximum……\e"
MF04090029,"\h(«Kalifa»)Vous aurez le pouvoir d'appeler tous vos alliés
pour qu'ils viennent se battre à vos côtés.\c"
MF04090030,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Les réactions
de votre équipage dépendront de l'état de
votre navire.\e"
MF04090031,"\h(«Kalifa»)Une fois que vous avez un équipage, essayez de
discuter souvent avec eux.
Surtout s'ils ont perdu tout espoir.\c"
MF04090032,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Si vous
voulez que vos canons soient plus efficaces,
engagez un “Canonnier” dans votre équipage.\e"
MF04090033,"\h(«Kalifa»)D'un autre côté, si vous voulez augmenter la
puissance de défense de votre navire, vous
devriez engager un “Ingénieur” pour
l'entretenir.\c"
MF04090034,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! La princesse
Moegi tombera amoureuse. Mais elle en souffrira
beaucoup.\e"
MF04090035,"\h(«Kalifa»)C'est…… c'est tout ce que je vois. L'avenir est
incertain. Vous devez être fort, car vous portez
l'avenir du monde sur vos épaules.\c"
MF04090036,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Si vous
n'abandonnez pas pendant la bataille, tout le
monde entendra parler de votre bravoure.\e"
MF04090037,"\h(«Kalifa»)D'un autre côté, si vous fuyez sans cesse vos
adversaires, les gens entendrons parler de votre
lâcheté. Prenez garde à vos actions.\c"
MF04090038,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Quand une
Pierre de Lune est contaminée, elle devient un
“Chom.”
Elles produisent l'effet opposé des “Chams.”\e"
MF04090039,"\h(«Kalifa»)Si vous donnez un Chom à Cupil, il régurgitera
tous les Choms qu'il a mangé jusqu'à un certain
point. Servez-vous-en à bon escient.\c"
MF04090040,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose ! Ce soir, ne
mangez surtout pas de poisson !\e"
MF04090041,"\h(«Kalifa»)Si vous en mangez, vous aurez mal à l'estomac et
vous aurez encore plus mal que si vous aviez le
mal de l'air.\c"
MF04090042,\h(«Kalifa»)…… Rien. Je ne vois rien.\e
MF04090043,"\h(«Kalifa»)Bien, imaginez que l'or que vous avez dépensé
est comme un investissement pour l'avenir.\c"
MF04090044,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose !
Vous voyagerez à bord d'un navire dans un pays
lointain !\e"
MF04090045,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oh, désolée. Vous l'avez déjà fait, n'est-ce
pas ?\c"
MF04090046,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose !\e"
MF04090047,"\h(«Kalifa»)La sagesse des anciens sera anéantie à cause des
sentiments d'un jeune coeur.\c"
MF04090048,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose !
Je vois un grand danger dans votre avenir
proche !\e"
MF04090049,"\h(«Kalifa»)Le mal prend diverses formes,
mais en réalité…… il n'en a aucune.
C'est tout ce que je peux dire pour le moment.\c"
MF04090050,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose !
Mais c'est flou…… Peut-être que 10 pièces
d'or supplémentaires pourront clarifier les
choses !\e"
MF04090051,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hé, les diseuses de bonne aventure doivent
gagner leur pain elles aussi, vous savez.\c"
MF04090052,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose !
C'est une Pierre de Lune ! Mais, de couleur……\e"
MF04090053,"\h(«Kalifa»)C'est difficile à voir. Pas rouge. Ni violet, ni
bleu, ni vert. Ni jaune, ni argent.
C'est la première fois que je vois cette
couleur.\c"
MF04090054,"\h(«Kalifa»)Oui, oui ! Je vois quelque chose !\e"
MF04090055,"\h(«Kalifa»)Le Ciel Profond vous réserve des surprises !
Faites attention Vyse, le mal rôde sous les
nuages.\c"
MF04090066,"\h(«Kalifa»)La lune rouge a parlé. N'oubliez jamais ses
paroles et vous connaîtrez le chemin.\e"
MF04090067,"\h(«Kalifa»)Je suis vraiment désolée, mais vous n'avez pas
assez d'or. Revenez plus tard.\c"
MF04090068,"\h(«Kalifa»)Je vois…… très bien. Si un jour vous avez besoin
des conseils de la Lune Rouge, n'hésitez pas à
revenir.\c"
MF04090069,"\h(«Kalifa»)Souvenez-vous bien de ce que je vous dis.
Allez et accomplissez votre destinée.\e"
MF04090070,"\h(«Kalifa»)Au fait, pouvez-vous arranger cette tente ?
C'est vraiment difficile de se concentrer dans……
un endroit aussi austère.\c"
MF05030000,"\h(«Merida»)J'ai entendu dire que la famille royale de Valua
est vraiment cruelle, et que ses habitants sont
sans pitié.\e"
MF05030001,"\h(«Merida»)Mais Enrique est vraiment gentil. Marco aussi
est adorable. Je crois qu'il ne faut pas juger
les gens simplement parce qu'ils ne viennent pas
du même monde.\c"
MF05100000,"\h(«Hans»)J'apprends tout sur la construction navale avec
Brabham en ce moment.\e"
MF05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Brabham s'y connaît en moteurs,
en modèles anciens et nouveaux, il m'a vraiment
beaucoup appris ! Mon père serait fier de moi !\e"
MF05100002,"\h(«Hans»)Il m'a permis de lire le Livre Yafutoman sur les
Polarités Navales.\e"
MF05100003,"\h(«Hans»)En le lisant, j'ai appris à construire un moteur
qui avance grâce au mouvement des vagues et à
manier les voiles quand on vole en très haute
altitude !\c"
MF05100004,"\h(«Hans»)Le Moteur du Grand Océan de Nuages nous a donné
beaucoup de travail. Et Brabham est vraiment
strict sur le chantier.\e"
MF05100005,"\h(«Hans»)Il doit être fatigué après toutes les nuits
blanches qu'il a passées, mais il ne le montre
pas. Il a tellement d'énergie, surtout pour son
âge !\e"
MF05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Eh bien, notre base est aussi bien qu'avant.
À présent, il faut préparer l'attaque de Valua.\e"
MF05100007,"\h(«Hans»)Avez-vous remarqué la rapidité de certains de
leurs navires pendant l'attaque ? Et aussi ce
navire qui pouvait naviguer sous les nuages ?\e"
MF05100008,"\h(«Hans»)Je me demande pourquoi les Valuans se servent de
leur technologie avancée uniquement pour tuer
les gens……\c"
MF05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse……
C'est l'heure de la bataille finale……\e"
MF05100010,"\h(«Hans»)Le navire de mon père, le Cuirassé, est prêt à
passer à l'action, lui aussi !\e"
MF05100011,"\h(«Hans»)Nous avons terminé le Delphinus.
Il est prêt à partir !\c"
MF05210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)Capitaine, saviez-vous que vous pouviez voir
toute l'île depuis ici ?\e"
MF05210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)Rien à signaler aujourd'hui. Euh, à part Izmael
qui a mangé le déjeuner de Brabham quand il
avait le dos tourné.\c"
MF05210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Rien à signaler aujourd'hui. Euh, à part Marco
qui a mal au ventre. Je crois qu'il a bu l'eau
de la mare……\c"
MF05210003,"\h(«Tikatika»)N'allez pas près de la mare. Le Prince
Enrique et la Princesse Moegi se disent adieu
avant qu'il ne parte. Laissez-les seuls.\c"
MF05210004,"\h(«Tikatika»)Rien à signaler aujourd'hui. Mais, j'ai remarqué
que la Princesse Moegi va à la mare chaque jour
pour prier……\c"
MF05210005,"\h(«Tikatika»)Bienvenue parmi nous, Capitaine. J'essayais de
voir où vous alliez dans ce petit bateau,
mais……\e"
MF05210006,"\h(«Tikatika»)même moi je n'arrivais pas à voir. C'est la
première fois que cela m'arrive. Le Grand
Temple d'Argent doit être très haut dans le
ciel……\e"
MF05210007,"\h(«Tikatika»)Je n'arrive pas à voir d'ici cette île qui a
surgi des nuages…… même avec mes yeux perçants.\e"
MF05210008,"\h(«Tikatika»)Mais, je sens que les oiseaux venus de l'Océan
ont peur. J'ai vraiment un mauvais
pressentiment……\e"
MF05210009,"\h(«Tikatika»)Rien à signaler aujourd'hui. Oh…… je vois tout
le monde d'ici !\e"
MF05210010,"\h(«Tikatika»)Ils sont tous si dynamiques ! J'arrive à
percevoir leur Esprit. Je suis certain que nous
allons gagner la bataille contre l'Armada !\c"
MF07060000,"\h(«Don»)Quand on m'a dit que jadis cette île était
déserte, j'ai pensé que ce serait encore plus
déprimant qu'Esparanza.\e"
MF07060001,"\h(«Don»)Mais, les boissons et la nourriture sont
vraiment variées, et vous avez un équipage
formidable.
Vous vous débrouillez vraiment bien !\c"
MF07060002,"\h(«Don»)Dans le Ciel Profond, hein ? Je n'ai même pas
réussi à traverser le Récif Noir. Et maintenant
je vais naviguer dans les enfers avec
vous.\e"
MF07060003,"\h(«Don»)Vyse, il faut bien le dire, on ne s'ennuie
jamais quand vous êtes là. Vous nous inspirez et
ce n'est rien de le dire !\e"
MF07060004,"\h(«Don»)Nous aurions réussi à traverser le Récif Noir si
vous aviez été avec nous.\c"

d'Argent !\e"
MF07060006,"\h(«Don»)Pendant que vous étiez parti à l'aventure, moi
je travaillais comme un forcené à tout
reconstruire.\c"
MF07060007,"\h(«Don»)Il s'est passé quelque chose sur la Lune Jaune.
Des Pierres de Lune sont tombées sur Valua.
Ensuite, nous avons entendu des explosions.\e"
MF07060008,"\h(«Don»)Je veux faire une croix sur mon passé, mais je
m'inquiète pour les Valuans.
Ils ne sont pas tous mauvais, vous savez.\c"
MF07060009,"\h(«Don»)Alors, voilà.
Si nous revenons tous vivants,
il faudra fêter ça !\e"
MF07060010,\h(«Don»)J'ai préparé une bouteille de loqua !\e
MF07060011,"\h(«Don»)À l'attaque, Vyse !\c"
MF08030000,\h(«Urala»)Oh…… Vyse. Um…… c'est une jolie taverne.\e
MF08030001,"\h(«Urala»)J'aimerais cuisiner des plats Yafutoman pour
tous les habitants de l'île……\e"
MF08030002,"\h(«Urala»)Mais, j'imagine que ce ne sera pas possible tant
que la cuisine n'est pas rénovée……\e"
MF08030003,"\h(«Urala»)Oh, ne faites pas attention.
Ma cuisine me manque, c'est tout.\c"
MF08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Vous avez trouvé une île magnifique, Vyse.
Cette mare me rappelle chez moi. Cela me détend.\e"
MF08070001,\h(«Moegi»)J'aimerais rester assise ici pour toujours……\c

Peut-être que je pourrais le rassurer……\c"
MF08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique, je sais que votre décision est
irrévocable. Je…… je comprends votre loyauté et
votre amour pour ce pays.\e"

je vous en prie, revenez-moi sain et sauf. Je ne

pour le Prince Enrique.
J'espère qu'il ne lui est rien arrivé……\e"
MF08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Je sais qu'il est fort, mais il est tout seul.
J'espère au mieux, mais je crains le pire.\e"
MF08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Je vous en prie, Prince Enrique, je vous en
prie…… revenez-moi.\c"
MF08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Cette île qui a surgi du Ciel Profond me donne
un mauvais pressentiment.\e"
MF08070010,\h(«Moegi»)J'en ai la chair de poule rien que d'y penser.\c
MF08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Je crois avoir entendu le Prince Enrique crier
quand les Pierres de Lune sont tombées sur
Valua. J'espère qu'il ne lui est rien arrivé.\e"
MF08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Capitaine Vyse, d'après vous le Prince Enrique
n'est pas en danger, n'est-ce pas ?\c"
MF08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)Je suis si contente que le Prince Enrique soit
revenu sain et sauf. Je ne sais pas ce que
j'aurais fait s'il lui était arrivé malheur.\c"
MF08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Capitaine Vyse, puis-je vous accompagner lors
d'une bataille contre l'Armada ?\e"

du Prince Enrique……\c"

construire quelque chose.\e"

retraite. Il me reste tant de choses à voir.\e"

Il nous reste du chemin à faire !\e"

se reposer ?\e"

étaient allés dans un endroit aussi horrible
après leur mort……\e"

Elle dit que oui,
mais elle a l'air vraiment triste……\e"

comme son grand-père ? Cela n'a pas dû être
facile pour elle de le perdre.\c"
MFp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)Je ne pensais pas que Galcian ferait pleuvoir
les Pluies de la Destruction un jour !\e"
MFp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)Et sur son propre pays en plus !
Je n'arrive pas à croire qu'il ait tué autant de
gens. Il faut trouver un moyen de l'arrêter !\c"
MFp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Alors tout va se jouer pendant cette bataille……
J'étais vraiment stressée hier soir, et je n'ai
pas beaucoup dormi.\e"
MFp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)Au début, j'avais peur, mais en pensant à tous
ces Pirates de l'Air qui sont venus pour se
battre avec nous, cela m'a rassurée.\e"

Delphinus ! Rentrons vite au port !\c"

Delphinus ! Tout le monde attend tes ordres !\c"
MFp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Bonjour, Vyse !
Merci d'avoir discuté avec moi hier soir.
Cela m'a détendu et j'ai réussi à dormir.\e"
MFp0010027,"\h(«Aika»)Je sais que nous pouvons vaincre Galcian.
Je fais confiance à tous les Pirates……
Et je te fais confiance.\e"
MFp0010028,"\h(«Aika»)Je me sens capable d'affronter tous nos
ennemis tant que tu es à mes côtés.
Je suis certaine que les autres Pirates de l'Air
pensent la même chose.\e"
MFp0010029,"\h(«Aika»)Faisons de notre mieux.
Tout le monde compte sur toi, Vy…… je veux dire
Capitaine Vyse !!!\c"
MFp0010030,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, il faut vraiment revenir au port !
Tout le monde t'attend pour mener la
bataille !\c"
MFp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)Je pensais que tout serait terminé après avoir
vaincu Galcian, mais apparemment j'avais tort,
hein ?\e"
MFp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)Mais je n'ai pas peur puisque tu es là avec
moi…… et nous avons fait tout ce chemin
ensemble, hein ?\e"
MFp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)OK, allons faire la peau à Ramirez pour revenir
au plus vite sur l'Île Croissant, et faire la
plus grosse fête de tous les temps !\c"
MFp0020000,"\h(«Fina»)C'est…… une très belle île.
Et vous avez même fait construire une chambre
pour moi.\e"
MFp0020001,"\h(«Fina»)Je n'arrive pas à le croire……
J'ai ma propre chambre sur votre base……\e"
MFp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)J'ai vraiment l'impression de faire partie des
Voleurs Bleus maintenant.
Je…… je suis si contente. Merci, Vyse.\e"
MFp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)La dernière fois que nous avons vu Drachma, il a
dit que ce ne serait pas facile de tout
recommencer à zéro……\e"
MFp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)Tu crois qu'il nous rejoindra,
quand ça ira mieux ?\c"
MFp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)Nous avons enfin tous les Cristaux de Lune.
Ma mission est enfin terminée.
Merci de m'avoir aidée.\c"
MFp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)Nous pouvons enfin aller dans le Ciel Profond ?
Je ne connais pas bien cet endroit.
J'ai un peu peur……\e"
MFp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)Je suppose que le moment est venu d'aller
chercher mon navire…… Merci de tout ce que vous
avez fait pour moi……\c"
MFp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Donc, le Delphinus pourra naviguer dans le Ciel
Profond…… Je ne pensais pas y aller un jour.\c"
MFp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique va retourner dans son pays natal,
Valua……\e"
MFp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Moi aussi je repartirai dans mon pays natal
après avoir retrouvé mon navire. Je…… je n'ai
presque pas envie d'y retourner.\e"
MFp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)Ça va aller. J'ai décidé de ne plus me lamenter
au sujet de Ramirez qui a changé de bord. Il
faut l'arrêter à tout prix !\e"
MFp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez et moi…… Nous avons été élevés par les
Anciens dans le Grand Temple d'Argent.\e"
MFp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)L'Ancien Prime était le plus savant de tous les
Anciens. Il savait tout, de l'histoire à 
l'actualité internationale.\e"
MFp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)C'est Ramirez qui s'intéressait toujours le
plus aux histoires de l'Ancien Prime sur les
Chroniques d'Arcadia. Ils passaient des heures
ensemble.\e"
MFp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Je pense que c'est à cause des histoires de
l'Ancien Prime que Ramirez s'est intéressé aux
Cristaux. Je ne peux pas croire que Ramirez……
l'ait tué……\c"
MFp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, il y a eu tellement de morts quand les
Pluies de la Destruction sont tombées sur
Valua.\e"
MFp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)C'est la faute de Ramirez et du Giga d'Argent,
Zelos.\e"
MFp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)En tant que Silvite,
Je…… j'aurais dû arrêter Ramirez……\c"
MFp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Le moment est enfin arrivé d'affronter
Ramirez. Pour être franche, cela ne sera pas
facile pour moi de me battre contre lui.\e"
MFp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)Mais, en tant que Silvite…… c'est mon devoir de
l'arrêter.\e"
MFp0020023,"\h(«Fina»)Je ferai de mon mieux. Il faut empêcher
Galcian et Ramirez de détruire le monde.\c"
MFp0020024,"\h(«Fina»)Il faut arrêter Galcian et Ramirez,
avant que d'autres innocents ne périssent.\c"
MFp0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Bonjour, Vyse. Um…… merci de m'avoir remonté le
moral hier soir.\e"
MFp0020026,"\h(«Fina»)Pour être franche, cela ne sera pas facile pour
moi de me battre contre Ramirez. Mais……\e"
MFp0020027,"\h(«Fina»)Je veux me battre. Je veux aider à sauver le
monde. Je…… je veux me battre à vos côtés.\e"
MFp0020028,"\h(«Fina»)Alors je vais faire de mon mieux. Tant que vous
vous battez à mes côtés, je pense que nous
sortirons vainqueurs.\c"
MFp0020029,"\h(«Fina»)Allons-y, Vyse. Tout le monde doit nous attendre
au Delphinus.\c"
MFp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Allons-y Vyse, il faut arrêter Ramirez.\e"
MFp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)Pour l'amour de ce monde…… et à la mémoire de
l'Ancien Prime, Ramirez doit être arrêté.\c"
MFp0040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Bonjour, Vyse. Elle est vraiment impressionnante
pour une base secrète.\e"
MFp0040001,"\h(«Enrique»)Engager d'autres membres d'équipage favorisera
le bon fonctionnement de la base et du
Delphinus.\e"
MFp0040002,"\h(«Enrique»)Vous êtes le seul à avoir l'expérience et la
détermination nécessaires pour nous faire gagner
la bataille. Nous avons tous une grande
admiration pour vous, Vyse !\e"
MFp0040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, je vous ai confié le Delphinus. Prenez-en
soin, je le récupèrerai peut-être un jour.\c"
MFp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)En tant que Prince de Valua, je savais qu'un
jour je reviendrais à Valua, je ne pensais pas y
revenir par-dessous.\c"
MFp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Nous avons enfin tous les Cristaux de Lune.
Je vais pouvoir mettre fin à la tyrannie de ma
mère.\e"
MFp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Bien que nous soyons ennemis,
c'est quand même ma mère.\e"
MFp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)J'espère arriver à la convaincre qu'elle a tort
d'agir ainsi, et trouver un compromis.\c"
MFp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… Excusez-moi, je voudrais rester seul un
petit instant ?\e"
MFp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Les modifications du Delphinus doivent être
terminées. Retournons au port, Vyse.\c"
MFp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Ne prenez pas cet air inquiet.
Je vous promets de revenir.
Hé…… Je ne suis pas prêt à mourir.\e"
MFp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)J'ai…… j'ai une faveur à vous demander, Vyse.
S'il vous plaît…… veillez sur la Princesse Moegi
pendant mon absence. Elle…… elle compte beaucoup
pour moi.\c"
MFp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Le moment est venu d'affronter Galcian.
Je vais vous accompagner à bord du Delphinus.\e"
MFp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Galcian doit payer pour avoir détruit mon pays
natal, et tué ma mère……
et Gregorio……\c"
MFp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)Voilà…… Si nous sommes vainqueurs, la paix
reviendra dans le monde. Il faut gagner cette
bataille !\e"
MFp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Allons-y, Vyse…… Non, Capitaine Vyse !
Menez-nous à la victoire !\c"
MG01000000,"\h(«Polly»)Gar nicht schlecht hier. Erinnert mich
ein wenig an meine Taverne auf Sailors' Island.\e"
MG01000001,"\h(«Polly»)Ich denke schon, dass ich mich hier zurecht
finde……\e"
MG01000002,"\h(«Polly»)An der Küche könnte man jedoch etwas machen.
Sie müsste etwas umgebaut werden, wenn ich
einige meiner Spezialitäten darin kochen soll.\c"
MG01000003,"\h(«Polly»)Wenn ich ein wenig umbauen darf, dann kann ich
hier auf der Insel eine Taverne eröffnen.\c"
MG01140000,"\h(«Pinta»)Das ist eine wirklich schöne Insel! Und auch
noch schön gelegen! Von hier aus können wir alle
möglichen Abenteuer starten.\e"
MG02000000,"\h(«Marco»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich je aus Valua
herauskomme. Und ich wusste auch nicht, dass
die Welt dort draußen so groß ist!\e"
MG02000001,"\h(«Marco»)Nachdem du mir so eingängig davon berichtet
hast, wollte ich so viel wie möglich von der
Welt sehen. Danke, Vyse! Ich kann's kaum
erwarten, wieder auf Reisen zu gehen!\c"
MG02000002,"\h(«Marco»)He…… für mich war die größte Überraschung,
nachdem ich von Valua entflohen war,
wahrscheinlich der Himmel…… er ist blau.
Ich habe noch nie zuvor blauen Himmel gesehen……\e"
MG02000003,"\h(«Marco»)Und die Wolken sind weiß! Ich dachte, sie
wären alle so dunkel wie in Valua!\e"
MG02000004,"\h(«Marco»)He, lacht nicht! Wenn ihr euer ganzes Leben
in Lower City verbracht hättet, würdet ihr
mich verstehen!\c"
MG02000005,"\h(«Marco»)Also, wie sieht's aus mit dem neuen
Schiffsmotor?\e"
MG02000006,"\h(«Marco»)He…… wer hätte gedacht, dass ich mal Ingenieur
werden würde…… Ich habe tatsächlich daran
mitgebaut! Und das Ergebnis ist gar nicht
schlecht, muss ich sagen.\c"
MG02000007,"\h(«Marco»)Da bist du ja wieder, Vyse! Ich wette, es
hat dich überrascht, die Insel in so gutem
Zustand vorzufinden, oder?\e"
MG02000008,"\h(«Marco»)Ich habe Izmael ziemlich viel dabei geholfen!
Na ja…… ich hab zwar nur die Wände gestrichen,
aber das war schon eine Menge Arbeit!\c"
MG02000009,"\h(«Marco»)He, ihr habt doch die Sternschnuppen gesehen,
die über Valua vom Himmel gefallen sind, nicht?\e"
MG02000010,"\h(«Marco»)Seitdem das passiert ist, sehen du und Aika
so besorgt aus. Was ist los? Ist etwas
Schlimmes passiert?\c"
MG02000011,"\h(«Marco»)Die Armada hat die Moon Stones auf Valua
niederregnen lassen, nicht?\e"
MG02000012,"\h(«Marco»)Ich…… ich habe diesen Ort niemals richtig
gemocht, aber…… ich bin dort aufgewachsen.
Es macht mich traurig, dass jetzt nichts
mehr davon übrig ist.\e"
MG02000013,"\h(«Marco»)Vyse, versprich mir, dass wir die Armada
besiegen werden. Das können wir nicht
durchgehen lassen.\c"
MG02000014,"\h(«Marco»)Wir müssen sie stoppen, bevor sie alle anderen
Länder zerstören. Es gibt so viel, was ich
noch nicht gesehen habe.\c"
MG04090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Willkommen. Höre meine Worte, und die
Zukunft steht dir offen……\e"
MG04090001,"\h(«Wirst du dir die Zukunft voraussagen lassen?»)“Zahle 10 Goldstücke für die Voraussage.”
“Vielleicht ein anderes Mal.”\e"
MG04090002,\h( )Du hast Kalifa 10 Goldstücke gegeben.\e
MG04090003,"\h(«Kalifa»)Also gut.
Lass uns beginnen.\e"
MG04090004,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm……\e
MG04090005,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa!!!\e
MG04090006,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Denk daran, immer gut zu
kauen, bevor du dein Essen herunterschluckst!\e"
MG04090007,"\h(«Kalifa»)Auf diese Weise erstickst du nicht daran,
und es fördert die Verdauung.\c"
MG04090008,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du einen niedrigen
“Säbelrassler-Status” hast, wird sich das auf
deine Mission auswirken!\e"
MG04090009,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du einen geringen Wert hast, wird es
einfacher, aus Kämpfen wegzurennen oder sie
ganz und gar zu vermeiden!\c"
MG04090010,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Hmm…… sieht so aus,
als wäre es morgen teils heiter, teils bewölkt
mit vereinzeltem Regen.\e"
MG04090011,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du also draußen Wäsche aufgehängt hast,
holst du sie besser heute noch rein!\c"
MG04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Ein hoher
“Verwegenheitswert” beeinflusst die Moral
der Mannschaft auf positive Weise.\e"
MG04090013,"\h(«Kalifa»)Deine Tapferkeit wirkt sich auch im Kampf aus!
Deine Kampfkraft wird je nach deinen
Führungsqualitäten ansteigen!\c"
MG04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Auf…… Pirate Isle……
das kleine Mädchen mit Namen Lindsi…… o nein!
Sie wird am Anlegeplatz spielen und…… und……\e"
MG04090015,"\h(«Kalifa»)……und wird einen Splitter in den Finger
bekommen!\c"
MG04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Eine Frau von einer
Taverne und ein Mann, der schweigend für sich
allein dasitzt, werden wieder vereint!\e"
MG04090017,"\h(«Kalifa»)Und wenn sie erst einmal wieder als Mann und
Frau vereint sind, leben sie glücklich bis
ans Ende ihrer Tage. Was für ein schönes
Ende……\c"
MG04090018,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Deine Glückszahl ist 4.
Deine Glücksfarbe ist…… emm…… Blau.\e"
MG04090019,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ehepaare sollten mehr Zeit an der Luft
verbringen! Frische Luft und eine schöne
Aussicht können belebend wirken……\c"
MG04090020,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Auf Sailors' Island
gibt es einige seltene Artikel zu verkaufen.\e"
MG04090021,"\h(«Kalifa»)Also sollte man so oft wie möglich
vorbeischauen, um zu sehen, was für neue
Waren der Händler hat!\c"
MG04090022,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Während deiner Reisen
wirst du viele Leute treffen. Du wirst
dich auch von vielen Leuten trennen……\e"
MG04090023,"\h(«Kalifa»)……Was? Du meinst, das könnte auf jeden
zutreffen?! Du Skeptiker! Du musst lernen, dein
eigenes Schicksal zu akzeptieren. Dann wirst du
deine wahre Bestimmung erfahren.\c"
MG04090024,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! In dieser Welt gibt
es 3 besondere Chams, “Abirik-Chams” genannt.\e"
MG04090025,"\h(«Kalifa»)Man weiß nie, woher sie kommen, also
sei nett zu den Leuten…… vielleicht überraschen
sie dich mit einem Geschenk.\c"
MG04090026,"\h(«Kalifa»)Abwehrtechniken dauern nur eine Runde lang an,
aber ihre Wirkung ist garantiert.\e"
MG04090027,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du also die Schritte deines Feindes
voraussagen kannst, wirst du in der Lage sein,
seine Angriffe zu unterbinden.\c"
MG04090028,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du erst einmal
Kapitän deines eigenen Schiffes bist und deine
Spirits so hoch wie möglich sind……\e"
MG04090029,"\h(«Kalifa»)……wirst du die Macht erlangen, alle deine
Verbündeten mit zu dir in den Kampf zu
rufen.\c"
MG04090030,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Deine Mannschaft
wird unterschiedlich reagieren, je nach dem
Zustand deines Schiffes.\e"
MG04090031,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du eine eigene Mannschaft hast, sprich
oft mit ihr. Vor allem, wenn alles verloren
scheint.\c"
MG04090032,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du deine Kanonen
effektiver einsetzen möchtest, such nach einem
“Kanonier” für deine Mannschaft.\e"
MG04090033,"\h(«Kalifa»)Möchtest du andererseits die Abwehrkraft deines
Schiffes erhöhen, solltest du einen “Ingenieur”
finden, der bei der Wartung hilft.\c"
MG04090034,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Prinzessin Moegi wird
sich verlieben. Aber diese Liebe wird ihr
großen Schmerz bereiten.\e"
MG04090035,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ich…… ich kann nichts mehr sehen. Die Zukunft
ist in der Schwebe. Du musst stark sein, denn
das Schicksal der Welt lastet auf deinen
Schultern.\c"
MG04090036,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du dich stets
im Kampf bewährst, wird sich die Kunde von
deiner Tapferkeit verbreiten.\e"
MG04090037,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du andererseits immer vor deinen Gegnern
wegläufst, wird man dich für feige halten. Sei
vorsichtig bei allem, was du tust.\c"
MG04090038,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wird ein Moon Stone
verunreinigt, wird er zu einem “Chom”.
Diese haben die gegenteilige Wirkung von
“Chams.”\e"
MG04090039,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn man Cupil einen Chom gibt, wird er alle
Chams erbrechen, die er bis zu diesem
Zeitpunkt gegessen hat. Setze sie mit
Vorsicht ein.\c"
MG04090040,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Heute Abend darfst
du auf keinen Fall Fisch essen!\e"
MG04090041,"\h(«Kalifa»)Denn sonst verdirbst du dir den Magen, und dir
wird dermaßen schlecht, viel schlechter, als
wenn du mit einem Schiff fliegst.\c"
MG04090042,\h(«Kalifa»)……Nichts. Ich sehe nichts.\e
MG04090043,"\h(«Kalifa»)Nun, sieh das Gold, das du ausgegeben hast
einfach als Investition in die Zukunft.\c"
MG04090044,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Du wirst durch die Luft in ein entferntes
Land reisen!\e"
MG04090045,"\h(«Kalifa»)O pardon. Das hast du ja schon gemacht,
nicht wahr?\c"
MG04090046,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!\e"
MG04090047,"\h(«Kalifa»)Alte Weisheiten werden vom Gefühl eines jungen
Herzens widerlegt.\c"
MG04090048,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Ich sehe große Gefahr in deiner nahen Zukunft!\e"
MG04090049,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ein großes Unglück kann viele Formen annehmen,
aber in Wirklichkeit…… hat es keine.
Das ist alles, was ich im Moment sagen kann.\c"
MG04090050,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Aber es ist verschwommen…… Vielleicht reichen
10 Goldstücke, um die Sache etwas klarer
erscheinen zu lassen!\e"
MG04090051,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wahrsager müssen schließlich auch etwas essen,
meinst du nicht?\c"
MG04090052,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Ich sehe einen Mondstein! Aber seine Farbe ist……\e"
MG04090053,"\h(«Kalifa»)……schwer zu erkennen. Er ist nicht rot. Und
lila, blau oder grün ist er auch nicht. Gelb
oder silber auch nicht. Es ist eine Farbe,
die ich noch nie vorher gesehen habe.\c"
MG04090054,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!\e"
MG04090055,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hinter Deep Sky verbirgt sich mehr, als man
annimmt! Sei vorsichtig, Vyse, denn unter den
Wolken lauert das Böse.\c"
MG04090066,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Red Moon hat gesprochen. Denk immer daran,
und der Weg wird dir offenstehen.\e"
MG04090067,"\h(«Kalifa»)Tut mir leid, aber du hast nicht genug Gold.
Komm später wieder.\c"
MG04090068,"\h(«Kalifa»)Verstehe…… nun gut. Wenn du die Weisheit des
Red Moon suchst, zögere nicht, zu mir
zurückzukommen.\c"
MG04090069,"\h(«Kalifa»)Denk an meine Worte und bewahre sie in deinem
Herzen. Jetzt geh und erfülle dein Schicksal.\e"
MG04090070,"\h(«Kalifa»)Übrigens, kannst du etwas mit diesem Zelt
machen? Es ist sehr schwer, sich in einer
solch…… kargen Umgebung zu konzentrieren.\c"
MG05030000,"\h(«Merida»)Ich habe gehört, dass die königliche Familie
von Valua sehr grausam und das Volk sehr
kaltherzig sein soll.\e"
MG05030001,"\h(«Merida»)Aber Enrique ist sehr nett. Marco ist auch süß.
Ich finde es nicht richtig, Leute zu
verurteilen, nur weil sie woanders herkommen.\c"
MG05100000,"\h(«Hans»)Ich lerne gerade alles über den Schiffbau von
Brabham.\e"
MG05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Brabham ist Experte für alle Arten von
Maschinen, alte und neue Modelle, und ich habe
eine Menge von ihm gelernt! Mein Vater wäre
stolz auf mich!\e"
MG05100002,"\h(«Hans»)Er ließ mich das yafutomanische Buch über
Schiffspolarität lesen.\e"
MG05100003,"\h(«Hans»)So habe ich gelernt, einen Motor mit
Wellenbewegungs-Technologie zu bauen und wie man
die Segel beim Flug in extremen Höhen einstellen
muss!\c"
MG05100004,"\h(«Hans»)Die Great Cloud Sea Engine war ganz schön viel
Arbeit. Und Brabham ist streng, was Arbeit
betrifft.\e"
MG05100005,"\h(«Hans»)Er muss von all den schlaflosen Nächten müde
sein, aber er lässt es sich nicht anmerken.
Er hat so viel Energie, und das in seinem
Alter!\e"
MG05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Nun, unser Stützpunkt ist so gut wie neu.
Jetzt müssen wir uns auf den Angriff auf
Valua vorbereiten.\e"
MG05100007,"\h(«Hans»)Habt ihr bemerkt, wie schnell einige ihrer
Schiffe während des Angriffs waren? Und dann
dieses Schiff, das unter den Wolken fliegen
konnte?\e"
MG05100008,"\h(«Hans»)Ich frage mich, warum die Valuaner ihre
überlegene Technologie nur dafür einsetzen,
Menschen zu töten……\c"
MG05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse……
Es wird Zeit für die letzte Schlacht……\e"
MG05100010,"\h(«Hans»)Das Schiff meines Vaters, die Ironclad, ist auch
gefechtsbereit!\e"
MG05100011,"\h(«Hans»)Wir haben die Arbeit auf der Delphinus beendet.
Es kann losgehen!\c"
MG05210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)He, Käpt'n, wusstest du, dass man von hier
oben die ganze Insel überblicken kann?\e"
MG05210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)Heute gibt es nichts zu berichten. Naja,
abgesehen von der Tatsache, dass Izmael Brabhams
Mittagessen gegessen hat, als dieser nicht
hinsah.\c"
MG05210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Heute gibt es nichts zu berichten. Nun, außer,
dass Marco Magenschmerzen hat. Ich glaube, er
hat Wasser vom Teich getrunken……\c"
MG05210003,"\h(«Tikatika»)Haltet euch vom Teich fern. Prinz Enrique
und Prinzessin Moegi nehmen Abschied
voneinander, bevor er geht. Lasst sie in Ruhe.\c"
MG05210004,"\h(«Tikatika»)Heute gibt es nichts zu berichten. Mir ist
jedoch aufgefallen, dass Prinzessin Moegi jeden
Tag zum Teich hinunter geht, um zu beten……\c"
MG05210005,"\h(«Tikatika»)Willkommen daheim, Käpt'n. Ich wollte mal
sehen, wohin du in diesem kleinen Boot fährst,
aber……\e"
MG05210006,"\h(«Tikatika»)……selbst ich konnte nichts sehen. Dies ist das
erste Mal, dass mich meine Augen im Stich
gelassen haben. Der Great Silver Shrine muss
wirklich sehr hoch liegen……\e"
MG05210007,"\h(«Tikatika»)Ich kann diese Insel, die aus den Wolken
emporgestiegen ist, von hier aus nicht gut
erkennen…… selbst mit meinen Adleraugen.\e"
MG05210008,"\h(«Tikatika»)Aber ich spüre die Angst der Vögel, die vom Meer
her kommen. Das alles gibt mir ein schlechtes
Gefühl……\e"
MG05210009,"\h(«Tikatika»)Heute gibt es nichts zu berichten. He……
von hier aus kann ich alle sehen!\e"
MG05210010,"\h(«Tikatika»)Alle haben sie so viel Energie! Ich spüre
ihren Geist. Ich bin sicher, wir werden die
Schlacht gegen die Armada gewinnen!\c"
MG07060000,"\h(«Don»)Als ich hörte, dass dieser Ort einmal eine
Wüsteninsel war, nahm ich an, er würde noch
deprimierender sein als Esparanza.\e"
MG07060001,"\h(«Don»)Aber hier gibt es eine gute Auswahl an Essen
und Trinken, und ihr habt eine gute Mannschaft
zusammen. Das habt ihr gut gemacht!\c"
MG07060002,"\h(«Don»)In den Deep Sky? Ich hab's noch nicht
einmal durch das Dark Rift geschafft. Jetzt
segle ich mit euch in die Unterwelt.\e"
MG07060003,"\h(«Don»)Vyse, ich muss dir etwas sagen. Wenn du mit
von der Partie bist, bleibt kein Auge trocken.
Es wäre ein Unterstatement zu sagen, dass du
mich inspirierst.\e"
MG07060004,"\h(«Don»)Wir hätten es damals alle durch das Dark Rift
geschafft, wenn du dabei gewesen wärst.\c"
MG07060005,"\h(«Don»)He, ich möchte gern etwas über den Great
Silver Shrine erfahren!\e"
MG07060006,"\h(«Don»)Während ihr auf Abenteuerreise wart, habe ich
mich mit diesen Gebäuden herumgeplagt.\c"
MG07060007,"\h(«Don»)He, irgendetwas ist mit dem Yellow Moon
passiert.
Es regnete Mondsteine auf Valua, und danach gab
es einige Explosionen.\e"
MG07060008,"\h(«Don»)Ich möchte meine Vergangenheit hinter mich
bringen, aber ich mache mir Sorgen um die
Valuaner. Sie sind nicht alle schlecht,
weißt du.\c"
MG07060009,"\h(«Don»)Jetzt ist es also so weit!
Wenn wir es alle schaffen zurückzukehren, werden
wir feiern!\e"
MG07060010,\h(«Don»)Ich leg schon mal ne Flasche Loqua kalt!\e
MG07060011,"\h(«Don»)Wir holen sie uns, Vyse!\c"
MG08030000,"\h(«Urala»)Oh…… Vyse. Em…… das ist wirklich eine schöne
Taverne.\e"
MG08030001,"\h(«Urala»)Ich wünschte, ich könnte jedem auf dieser Insel
yafutomanisches Essen servieren……\e"
MG08030002,"\h(«Urala»)Aber das ist wohl nicht möglich, ohne die
Küche vorher zu renovieren……\e"
MG08030003,"\h(«Urala»)Oh, mach dir keine Sorgen.
Ich vermisse einfach meine eigene Küche.\c"
MG08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Das ist aber eine schöne Insel, die ihr hier
gefunden habt, Vyse. Dieser Teich erinnert
mich an zu Hause. Er ist sehr entspannend.\e"
MG08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich wünschte, ich könnte einfach für immer
hier sitzen……\c"
MG08070002,\h(«Moegi»)Etwas scheint Prinz Enrique zu beunruhigen……\e
MG08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich wünschte, er würde mir sagen, was es ist.
Vielleicht könnte ich etwas tun, um ihn zu
beruhigen……\c"
MG08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Prinz Enrique, ich weiß, Ihre Entscheidung
ist gefallen. Ich…… ich kann Ihre
Loyalität und die Liebe zu Ihrem Land verstehen.\e"
MG08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich kann Sie nicht aufhalten. Aber…… bitte,
bitte kommen Sie wieder gesund zu mir zurück.
Ich könnte es nicht ertragen, wenn Ihnen etwas
zustoßen würde……\c"
MG08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Seitdem die Insel angegriffen wurde, mache
ich mir Sorgen um Prinz Enrique. Ich hoffe,
er befindet sich in Sicherheit……\e"
MG08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich weiß, er ist stark, aber er ist ganz allein.
Ich versuche, das Beste zu hoffen, aber
ich befürchte das Schlimmste.\e"
MG08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Bitte, Prinz Enrique, bitte……
kommen Sie zurück.\c"
MG08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich hab ein ziemlich schlechtes Gefühl bei der
Insel, die sich aus dem Deep Sky erhoben hat.\e"
MG08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)Mir läuft ein Schauer den Rücken hinunter,
wenn ich nur daran denke.\c"
MG08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich glaubte, Prinz Enrique schreien zu hören,
als die Moon Stones auf Valua fielen.
Ich hoffe, er ist in Sicherheit.\e"
MG08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, Sie glauben doch, dass
Prinz Enrique in Sicherheit ist, nicht wahr?\c"
MG08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich bin so froh, dass Prinz Enrique sicher
zurückgekehrt ist. Ich weiß nicht, was ich
getan hätte, wenn ihm etwas passiert wäre.\c"
MG08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, können Sie mich bitte mitnehmen,
wenn Sie gegen die Armada kämpfen?\e"
MG08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich glaube nicht, dass ich es ertragen könnte,
noch einmal von Prinz Enrique getrennt zu sein……\c"
MG08070016,\h(«Moegi»)Vielleicht kann ich irgendwie behilflich sein……\e
MG08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)Dieser alte Izmael hat wirklich was auf dem
Kasten. Ich brauche ihm nur zuzusehen, und
schon will ich etwas für euch bauen.\e"
MG08150001,"\h(«Kirala»)Also, wie wär's? Es wird dich etwas Gold kosten,
aber ich garantiere gute Arbeit! Ich kann nicht
einfach hier herumsitzen, während Izmael sich
amüsiert!\e"
MG08150002,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Kirala bitten, etwas zu bauen.”
“Vielleicht ein anderes Mal.”\e"
MG08150003,"\h(«Kirala»)Na endlich! Also welches Gebäude soll ich
umbauen?\e"
MG08150004,"\h(«Was möchtest du umbauen?»)“Den Wohnbereich…… 2.000 Goldstücke.”
“Die Taverne…… 1.500 Goldstücke.”\e"
MG08150005,"\h(«Kirala»)Na endlich! Also welches Gebäude soll ich
umbauen?\e"
MG08150006,"\h(«Was möchtest du umbauen?»)“Den Wohnbereich…… 2.000 Goldstücke.”
“Die Taverne…… 1.500 Goldstücke.”
“Kalifas Zelt…… 1.000 Goldstücke.”\e"
MG08150007,"\h(«Kirala»)He, ich weiß zwar, wie man etwas baut, aber ich
kann nichts machen, solange ich nicht das Gold
habe, um Material zu kaufen.\c"
MG08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)Also, du willst den Wohnbereich umbauen?!
Das macht 2.000 Goldstücke…… Bist du sicher,
dass du so viel ausgeben willst?\e"
MG08150009,"\h(«Deinen Wohnbereich umbauen?»)“Ja, tu das.”
“Hmm…… lass mich noch mal darüber nachdenken.”\e"
MG08150010,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlass es mir! Ich habe alles fertig,
wenn ihr das nächste Mal auf die Insel
zurückkommt.\c"
MG08150011,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, du überlegst es dir noch mal?
Lass mich wissen, wenn du so weit bist.\e"
MG08150012,"\h(«Kirala»)He, ich bin vielleicht gut in meinem Job,
aber ich kann nichts machen, ohne dass ich
das Gold habe, um für alles zu bezahlen.
Komm wieder, wenn du genug hast!\c"
MG08150013,"\h(«Kirala»)Du willst also die Taverne umbauen? Das wird
1.500 Goldstücke kosten…… bist du sicher,
dass du es machen willst?\e"
MG08150014,"\h(«Die Taverne umbauen?»)“Ja.”
“Hmm…… lass mich noch mal darüber nachdenken.”\e"
MG08150015,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlass es mir! Ich habe alles fertig,
wenn du das nächste Mal auf die Insel
zurückkommst.\c"
MG08150016,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, du überlegst es dir noch mal?
Lass mich wissen, wenn du so weit bist.\e"
MG08150017,"\h(«Kirala»)He, ich bin vielleicht gut in meinem Job,
aber ich kann nichts machen, ohne dass ich
das Gold habe, um für alles zu bezahlen.
Komm wieder, wenn du genug hast!\c"
MG08150018,"\h(«Kirala»)Du willst also Kalifas Zelt umbauen?
Das wird 1.000 Goldstücke kosten…… bist du
sicher, dass du das machen willst?\e"
MG08150019,"\h(«Kalifas Zelt umbauen?»)“Ja.”
“Hmm…… lass mich noch mal darüber nachdenken.”\e"
MG08150020,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlass es mir! Ich werde ihr ein
schöneres Zelt bauen! Vielleicht gibt sie
uns dann ein paar nützlichere Informationen.\c"
MG08150021,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, du überlegst es dir noch mal?
Lass mich wissen, wenn du so weit bist.\e"
MG08150022,"\h(«Kirala»)Verstehe……
Also, wenn du es dir irgendwann anders
überlegst, lass es mich wissen.\e"
MG08150023,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlass es mir! Ich habe alles fertig,
wenn ihr das nächste Mal auf die Insel
zurückkommt.\c"
MG08150024,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, warte…… hast du nicht schon Izmael damit
beauftragt?\e"
MG08150025,"\h(«Kirala»)Wenn du willst, kann ich es umbauen.
Ist das in Ordnung?\e"
MG08150026,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Es von Izmael umbauen lassen.”
“Es von Kirala umbauen lassen.”\e"
MG08150027,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh, tut mir leid. Ich hatte vergessen, dass
ich Izmael schon damit beauftragt habe.\e"
MG08150028,"\h(«Kirala»)Hahaha…… schon in Ordnung.
Also, wenn du es später noch mal umbauen
willst, brauchst du es mir nur zu sagen.\c"
MG08150029,"\h(«Vyse»)Tja…… aber ich habe mir die Sache anders
überlegt. Ich habe beschlossen, dass
du es umbauen sollst.\e"
MG08150030,"\h(«Kirala»)Hahaha…… es geht wohl nichts über wahre
Qualität. Ich werde Izmael Bescheid
sagen und das Geld von ihm wiederholen.\e"
MG08150031,"\h(«Kirala»)Überlass einfach alles mir, ok?
Ich zeige dir die Schönheit der yafutomanischen
Architektur!\c"
MG14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Captain Vyse, dein Stützpunkt ist fertig!
Er ist gar nicht so schlecht, wenn man
bedenkt, womit ich hier auf der Insel
arbeiten musste.\e"
MG14010001,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow, Izmael, du bist TOLL! Es ist kaum zu
glauben, dass ich hier vor nicht allzu langer
Zeit mutterseelenallein gestrandet bin und in
einer Höhle schlief!\e"
MG14010002,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich habe dir doch gesagt, ich würde mich ums
Geschäft kümmern! Jetzt, wo ich unser
Hauptquartier also fertig habe……\e"
MG14010003,\h(«Izmael»)möchte ich gern mit euch segeln!\e
MG14010004,"\h(«Vyse»)Jeder, der eine einsame Insel in eine
Festung verwandeln kann, ist uns sehr
willkommen!\e"
MG14010005,"\h(«Izmael»)Was kann ich dazu sagen?
Ich bin der größte Baumeister der je lebte!\e"
MG14010006,"\h( )Izmael ist als “Baumeister” zu deiner
Mannschaft gestoßen.\c"
MG14010007,"\h(«Izmael»)Also, mir gefällt der Stützpunkt ganz gut,
aber ich glaube, dass ich ihn ein wenig
aufmöbeln könnte, wenn ich mehr Geld hätte.\e"
MG14010008,"\h(«Izmael»)Was meint ihr? Soll ich ein paar der Gebäude
umbauen?\e"
MG14010009,"\h(«Soll Izmael ein Gebäude umbauen?»)“Das wäre toll!”
“Vielleicht ein anderes Mal.”\e"
MG14010010,\h(«Izmael»)Welches Gebäude möchtest du umgebaut haben?\e
MG14010011,"\h(«Welches möchtest du umgebaut haben?»)“Den Wohnbereich…… 2.000 Goldstücke.”
“Die Taverne…… 1.500 Goldstücke.”\e"
MG14010012,\h(«Izmael»)Welches Gebäude möchtest du umgebaut haben?\e
MG14010013,"\h(«Was möchtest du umgebaut haben?»)“Den Wohnbereich…… 2.000 Goldstücke.”
“Die Taverne…… 1.500 Goldstücke.”
“Kalifas Zelt…… 1.000 Goldstücke.”\e"
MG14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)Käpt'n, du hast nicht genug Geld. Ich würde
es ja umsonst machen, aber ich müsste Material
und so weiter kaufen. Komm wieder, wenn du das
Gold hast.\e"
MG14010015,"\h(«Izmael»)Du willst also deinen Wohnbereich umbauen?
Das macht 2.000 Goldstücke…… bist du sicher,
dass du das willst?\e"
MG14010016,"\h(«Den Wohnbereich umbauen?»)“Das kannst du machen.”
“Hmm…… lass es mich noch einmal überdenken.”\e"
MG14010017,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, überlass es mir! Es wird dir gefallen,
was ich daraus mache! Es wird fertig
sein, wenn ihr auf die Insel zurückkommt.\c"
MG14010018,"\h(«Izmael»)Wie schade. Wenn du es dir anders überlegst,
lass es mich wissen!\e"
MG14010019,"\h(«Izmael»)Käpt'n, du hast nicht genug Geld. Ich würde
es ja umsonst machen, aber ich müsste Material
und so weiter kaufen. Komm wieder, wenn du das
Gold hast.\e"
MG14010020,"\h(«Izmael»)Du willst also die Taverne umbauen? Das wird
1.500 Goldstücke kosten…… bist du sicher,
dass du das willst?\e"
MG14010021,"\h(«Die Taverne umbauen?»)“Ja, tu das.”
“Hmm…… lass es mich noch mal überdenken.”\e"
MG14010022,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, überlass es mir! Bis du wieder auf die
Insel zurückkehrst, habe ich alles fertig.\c"
MG14010023,"\h(«Izmael»)Wie schade. Wenn du es dir anders überlegst,
lass es mich wissen!\e"
MG14010024,"\h(«Izmael»)Captain, du hast nicht genug Geld. Ich würde
es ja umsonst machen, aber ich müsste Material
und so weiter kaufen. Komm wieder, wenn du das
Gold hast.\e"
MG14010025,"\h(«Izmael»)Also, du willst Kalifas Zelt umbauen?
Das wird 1.000 Goldstücke kosten……
willst du das wirklich?\e"
MG14010026,"\h(«Kalifas Zelt umbauen?»)“Ja.”
“Hmm…… lass es mich noch einmal überdenken.”\e"
MG14010027,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, überlass es mir! Ich werde Kalifa ein
größeres Zelt bauen, bis du wieder auf die Insel
zurückkommst.\c"
MG14010028,"\h(«Izmael»)Wie schade. Wenn du es dir anders überlegst,
lass es mich wissen!\e"
MG14010029,"\h(«Izmael»)Wie schade. Wenn du es dir anders überlegst,
lass es mich wissen!\e"
MG14010030,"\h(«Izmael»)Überlass es mir! Wenn du zurück auf die Insel
kommst, werde ich damit fertig sein!\e"
MG14010031,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam bam baaam!
Hast du nicht schon Kirala gebeten, dieses
Gebäude für dich umzubauen?\e"
MG14010032,"\h(«Izmael»)Wenn du willst, kann ich es für dich umbauen!\e"
MG14010033,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Es von Kirala umbauen lassen.”
“Es von Izmael umbauen lassen.”\e"
MG14010034,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh…… ich hatte fast vergessen, dass ich Kirala
gebeten hatte, es umzubauen. Tut mir leid,
Izmael.\e"
MG14010035,"\h(«Izmael»)Ba-bam!
Sieht so aus, als würdest du vergesslich
auf deine alten Tage! Hahahaha!\e"
MG14010036,"\h(«Vyse»)Also, ich habe in der Tat darüber nachgedacht,
und ich möchte, dass du es umbaust.\e"
MG14010037,"\h(«Izmael»)Zu Befehl!
Ich mache mich gleich an die Arbeit!\e"
MG14010038,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich werde mir das Geld von Kirala holen.
Du brauchst dir um nichts Sorgen zu machen, ok?
Überlass einfach alles mir!\c"
MG14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich habe alles verloren, was mir am Herzen lag……
Ich habe alles im Dark Rift verloren.\e"
MG14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)……Alles, was ich noch hatte, waren meine
Erinnerungen an Polly.\e"
MG14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)Während dieser Jahre im Dark Rift wurde mir
klar, wie wichtig mir Polly war.\e"
MG14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich war mir nie darüber klar, was ich an ihr
hatte, bis sie fort war. Ich werde an ihrer
Seite bleiben, bis wir hier fertig sind.
Dann gehen wir zurück nach Sailors' Island.\c"
MG14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)Captain Vyse…… ich nehme an, wir fahren jetzt
zu dieser furchtbaren Insel……\e"
MG14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)Wir müssen die Valuaner stoppen, bevor sie alles
zerstören. Polly und ich haben noch unser
ganzes Leben vor uns.\c"
MG14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)Wir müssen diesen Kampf gewinnen!
Ich tue alles, um euch zu helfen!\e"
MGp0010000,"\h(«Aika»)Wo wir jetzt unseren eigenen Inselstützpunkt
haben, fühlst du dich sicher wie ein richtiger
Kapitän. Captain Vyse…… hört sich gut an.\e"
MGp0010001,"\h(«Aika»)Du bist in deinem eigenen Schiff um die Welt
gesegelt! Nicht viele Leute können von sich
behaupten, dass sie ihre Kindheitsträume
verwirklicht haben, weißt du.\e"
MGp0010002,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika, das hört sich so an, als ob ich gleich
in den Ruhestand ginge. Es gibt noch so viel,
was ich nicht gesehen habe.\e"
MGp0010003,"\h(«Vyse»)Und es gibt noch viele unentdeckte Schätze
aufzuspüren. Vor uns liegt ein langer Weg!\e"
MGp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)Haha, das sieht dir ähnlich! Keine Sorge,
ich bin mit von der Partie! Besonders, wenn es
dabei um einen Schatz geht.\c"
MGp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)Ich werde mein Bestes tun, Captain Vyse. Haha……
Hört sich gut an. Dabei muss ich lachen.\c"
MGp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, jetzt, wo du höher und tiefer fliegen
kannst als je zuvor, können wir uns all die
Orte vornehmen, an denen wir noch nicht waren!\c"
MGp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)Brabham sollte jetzt die Arbeit an der
Delphinus beendet haben!\e"
MGp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Lass uns schnell zum Hafen zurückgehen, Vyse!\c"
MGp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)Ich wollte Enrique eigentlich von jetzt an
'Brech-Prinz' nennen, weil er sich immer über
die Bordkante übergeben hat……\e"
MGp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)Jetzt hat er sich aber zu einem richtigen
Seemann gemausert!\e"
MGp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)Es wird schon werden…… nicht wahr, Vyse……?\c"
MGp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)Erinnerst du dich noch, als wir Kinder waren,
wie alle Deep Sky als kalten, dunklen Ort
beschrieben, wo die Toten ihren Ruheplatz
haben?\e"
MGp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)Ich wollte nicht glauben, dass meine Mutter
und mein Vater nach ihrem Tod an so einen
furchtbaren Ort kommen sollten……\e"
MGp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)Also habe ich mir geschworen, eines Tages
nach Deep Sky zu reisen und es mit eigenen
Augen zu sehen. Ich wollte beweisen, dass
alle Unrecht hatten.\c"
MGp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)Ich hoffe, Fina geht es gut……
Sie sagt, ja, aber sie sieht so
traurig aus……\e"
MGp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)War Elder Prime nicht wie ein Großvater
zu ihr? Es muss sehr schwer für sie gewesen
sein, ihn zu verlieren.\c"
MGp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass Galcian die
Rains of Destruction tatsächlich anwenden
würde!\e"
MGp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)Und noch dazu auf sein eigenes Land!
Ich kann nicht glauben, wie viele Leute er
getötet hat. Wir müssen einen Weg finden,
ihn aufzuhalten!\c"
MGp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Also hängt alles von dieser Schlacht ab……
Ich war letzte Nacht richtig nervös und habe
nicht viel geschlafen.\e"
MGp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)Zuerst hatte ich Angst, aber als ich an all
die Luftpiraten dachte, die hier sind, um mit
uns zu kämpfen, fing ich an, mich besser zu
fühlen.\e"
MGp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)In Ordnung, Vyse, alle warten sie auf uns bei
der Delphinus! Lass uns schnell zum Hafen
zurücklaufen!\c"
MGp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)Wir sollten auf die Delphinus zurück!
Alle erwarten sie deine Befehle!\c"
MGp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Guten Morgen, Vyse!
Danke für unser Gepräch gestern
Abend. Ich konnte mich etwas
entspannen und habe auch geschlafen.\e"
MGp0010027,"\h(«Aika»)Ich weiß, dass wir Galcian schlagen können.
Ich habe Vertrauen in alle…… und ich habe
Vertrauen in dich.\e"
MGp0010028,"\h(«Aika»)Zusammen mit dir würde ich es
mit jedem aufnehmen. Ich bin sicher, die
anderen Luftpiraten sind der gleichen Meinung.\e"
MGp0010029,"\h(«Aika»)He, he…… wir tun unser Bestes.
Alle zählen auf dich, Vy…… ich meine,
Captain Vyse!!!\c"
MGp0010030,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, wir sollten wirklich zurück zum Hafen!
Alle warten darauf, dass du uns in die Schlacht
führst!\c"
MGp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)Ich dachte, alles würde vorbei sein, sobald wir
Galcian besiegt haben, aber es sieht
so aus, als hätte ich Unrecht, nicht wahr?\e"
MGp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)Ich habe aber keine Angst, weil du da bist……
und wir haben es ja zusammen ziemlich weit
gebracht, nicht wahr?\e"
MGp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)Ok, lasst uns Ramirez windelweich schlagen,
damit wir nach Crescent Isle zurückkehren und
die größte Party aller Zeiten feiern können!\c"
MGp0020000,"\h(«Fina»)Es ist eine…… sehr schöne Insel.
Und ihr habt sogar ein Zimmer für mich
bereit.\e"
MGp0020001,"\h(«Fina»)Ich kann's nicht fassen…… ich habe tatsächlich
mein eigenes Zimmer in eurem Heimatstützpunkt……\e"
MGp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)Ich fühle mich wie ein Mitglied der Blue
Rogues. Ich…… ich bin so glücklich. Danke,
Vyse.\e"
MGp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)Als wir ihn zum letzten Mal sahen, sagte 
Drachma, dass es nicht einfach für ihn sein
würde, sein Leben noch mal von vorne zu
beginnen……\e"
MGp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)Glaubst du, er wird sich uns wieder anschließen,
wenn er sich besser fühlt?\c"
MGp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)Wir haben endlich alle Moon Crystals zusammen.
Meine Mission ist vorbei.
Danke für all eure Hilfe.\c"
MGp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)Wir können endlich zum Deep Sky gelangen?
Darüber weiß ich nicht viel.
Ich habe etwas Angst……\e"
MGp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)Ich nehme an, es ist Zeit, nach meinem Schiff
zu suchen…… Danke für alles, was ihr für mich
getan habt……\c"
MGp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Die Delphinus wird also in der Lage sein, zum
Deep Sky zu segeln…… ich hätte mir nie träumen
lassen, dass ich einmal da runter müsste.\c"
MGp0020008,\h(«Fina»)Enrique kehrt in seine Heimat Valua zurück……\e
MGp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Ich muss auch in meine Heimat zurückkehren,
sobald wir mein Schiff finden. Ich…… ich will
fast gar nicht mehr zurück.\e"
MGp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)Ich bin soweit. Ich habe beschlossen, keine
Zeit mehr damit zu verschwenden, darüber
nachzudenken, wie sich Ramirez verändert hat.
Man muss ihn aufhalten.\e"
MGp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez und ich…… wir wurden beide von den
Ältesten im Great Silver Shrine erzogen.\e"
MGp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)Unter den Ältesten war Elder Prime derjenige
mit dem meisten Wissen. Er wusste alles, von
geschichtlichen Aufzeichnungen bis zum aktuellen
Weltgeschehen.\e"
MGp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez war immer am meisten an den Geschichten
von Elder Prime über die Chronicles of Arcadia
interessiert. Sie konnten Stunden miteinander
verbringen.\e"
MGp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Ich glaube, es waren die Geschichten von
Elder Prime, die Ramirez veranlassten, nach den
Kristallen zu suchen. Ich kann's nicht glauben,
dass Ramirez…… ihn getötet hat……\c"
MGp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, es wurden so viele Leute getötet, als
die Rains of Destruction auf Valua
niederrasselten.\e"
MGp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez und der Silver Gigas Zelos sind
dafür verantwortlich.\e"
MGp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Als Silviterin hätte ich…… Ramirez aufhalten
sollen……\c"
MGp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Endlich ist die Zeit gekommen, sich Ramirez zu
stellen. Um ganz ehrlich zu sein…… es ist
ziemlich schwer für mich, gegen ihn zu kämpfen.\e"
MGp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)Aber als Silviterin…… muss ich ihn aufhalten.
Es ist meine Pflicht.\e"
MGp0020023,"\h(«Fina»)Ich werde mein Bestes tun. Wir dürfen nicht
zulassen, dass Galcian und Ramirez diese Welt
zerstören.\c"
MGp0020024,"\h(«Fina»)Galcian und Ramirez müssen aufgehalten werden,
bevor unschuldige Leben verloren gehen.\c"
MGp0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Guten Morgen, Vyse.
Em…… danke für das, was du gestern Abend
getan hast.\e"
MGp0020026,"\h(«Fina»)Um ganz ehrlich zu sein, es ist ziemlich
schwer für mich, gegen Ramirez zu kämpfen.
Aber……\e"
MGp0020027,"\h(«Fina»)Ich möchte kämpfen. Ich möchte dabei helfen,
diese Welt zu retten. Ich…… ich möchte an eurer
Seite kämpfen.\e"
MGp0020028,"\h(«Fina»)Deshalb möchte ich versuchen, mein Bestes
zu tun. Solange ihr an meiner Seite kämpft,
glaube ich, dass wir gewinnen können.\c"
MGp0020029,"\h(«Fina»)Gehen wir, Vyse. Sie warten sicher alle bei
der Delphinus auf uns.\c"
MGp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Gehen wir, Vyse, wir müssen Ramirez aufhalten.\e"
MGp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)Um diese  Welt zu erhalten…… und zur Erinnerung
an Elder Prime…… muss Ramirez aufgehalten
werden.\c"
MGp0040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Hallo, Vyse. Für einen geheimen Stützpunkt
ist das hier ziemlich eindrucksvoll.\e"
MGp0040001,"\h(«Enrique»)Je mehr Leute uns auf dem Stützpunkt und auf
der Delphinus helfen, desto besser klappt
alles.\e"
MGp0040002,"\h(«Enrique»)Du bist der Einzige, der über die Erfahrung
und die Entschlusskraft verfügt, diese
Mannschaft zum Sieg zu führen. Wir alle
warten auf dich, Vyse!\e"
MGp0040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, ich habe dir die Delphinus anvertraut.
Bitte sei vorsichtig damit, vielleicht will
ich sie eines Tages wiederhaben.\c"
MGp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Als Prinz von Valua wusste ich, dass ich eines
Tages nach Valua zurückkehren würde, aber ich
hätte nie gedacht, dass ich von unten kommen
würde.\c"
MGp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Wir haben endlich alle Moon Crystals zusammen.
Jetzt kann ich die Tyrannei meiner Mutter
beenden.\e"
MGp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Obwohl wir nicht auf derselben Seite kämpfen,
ist sie nach wie vor meine Mutter.\e"
MGp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich hoffe, dass ich sie von ihrer Torheit
überzeugen kann, und dass wir zu einer
Übereinstimmung gelangen.\c"
MGp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… tut mir leid, aber könntest du mich
eine Weile in Ruhe lassen?\e"
MGp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Die Umbauarbeiten an der Delphinus müssten
beendet sein. Gehen wir zurück zum Hafen,
Vyse.\c"
MGp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Schau mich nicht so besorgt an.
Ich verspreche, dass ich zurückkomme.
He…… ich bin noch nicht bereit, zu sterben.\e"
MGp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich…… ich habe nur eine Bitte an dich, Vyse.
Bitte…… kümmere dich um Prinzessin Moegi,
während ich weg bin. Sie…… sie bedeutet mir
so viel.\c"
MGp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Also, es ist Zeit, sich Galcian zu stellen.
Ich werde euch auf der Delphinus begleiten.\e"
MGp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Galcian muss dafür bezahlen, dass er meine
Heimat zerstört und meine Mutter…… und
Gregorio…… getötet hat.\c"
MGp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)Jetzt geht's drum…… wenn wir gewinnen, wird die
Welt in Frieden leben. Wir müssen diese Schlacht
gewinnen!\e"
MGp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Gehen wir, Vyse…… nein, Captain Vyse!
Führe uns zum Sieg!\c"
Ms017b000,"\h(«Vyse»)Gonzales…
I found the treasure
that you were looking for.\e"
Ms017b001,"\h(«Vyse»)But, to be honest, it wasn't what
either of us was expecting…\c"
Ms017b002,\h(«Vyse»)Ow! Man! That's hot!!\c
Ms017b003,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like Izmael's in the middle
of planing the wood. I probably shouldn't touch
anything… I might mess it up.\c"
Ms017b004,"\h(«Vyse»)Whenever I see cement I feel like
putting footprints in it. I better not, though.
Izmael probably wouldn't like it very much.\c"
Ms017b005,"\h(«Vyse»)It's filled with cement mix.
Ngh! Man… it's too heavy! I can't even move
it an inch! Did Izmael carry this by himself?\c"
Ms017b006,"\h(«Vyse»)What's in this barrel? Ugh, it's tar!
That's just great… I got some on my clothes.\c"
Ms017b007,"\h(«Vyse»)It's sort of refreshing to see our flag flapping
in the wind like that…\e"
Ms017b030,"\h(«Change the flag?»)“Change it to Aika's design.”
“Change it to Fina's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017b031,"\h(«Change the flag?»)“Change it to my design.”
“Change it to Fina's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017b032,"\h(«Change the flag?»)“Change it to my design.”
“Change it to Aika's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017b008,"\h(«Vyse»)There're Nasr rugs, small boxes… All kinds of
stuff in random piles. I really don't know what
any of this is for, exactly…\c"
Ms017b009,"\h(«Vyse»)There're polished stones
and books with weird designs.
Maybe they're used for fortune-telling?\c"
Ms017b010,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a book filled with random-looking lines
and badly written letters.\e"
Ms017b011,"\h(«Vyse»)I guess Marco's been trying hard to learn
how to write. Good for him…\c"
Ms017b012,"\h(«Vyse»)I love the smell of roasting sausages
by the fireplace…\c"
Ms017b013,"\h(«Vyse»)This must be the crew's sleeping area.
Once in a while, you can hear someone
fall out of their hammock at night.\c"
Ms017b014,\h(«Vyse»)Maybe I'll call it a day…\e
Ms017b015,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Sleep for a little while.”
“Walk around a little more.”\e"
Ms017b016,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, I'm not really that tired.
I can always sleep later.\c"
Ms017b017,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh heh… Enrique's got a picture of
Moegi on his desk!\c"
Ms017b018,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this? Aika's got a picture
of me on her desk.
That's kinda embarrassing…\c"
Ms017b019,"\h(«Vyse»)Why does Fina have a picture of me on her desk?
It's a little embarrassing…\c"
Ms017b020,"\h(«Vyse»)It doesn't look like there's anyone here…
Well, it is a little late. Maybe I'll look
around a little bit more…\c"
Ms017b021,"\h(«Vyse»)Everyone's probably resting up for the big
battle tomorrow. I should probably let
them sleep…\c"
Ms017b022,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey… Aika's not here after all…
I wonder where she's gone off to…\c"
Ms017b023,"\h(«Vyse»)I wonder if Aika's gone to sleep yet…
Hmm… I probably shouldn't disturb her. She's
gonna need her rest for tomorrow's battle.\c"
Ms017b024,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina's not in her room…
I guess she isn't asleep after all.
I wonder where she is…\c"
Ms017b025,"\h(«Vyse»)I wonder if Fina's gone to sleep yet…
Hmm… I probably shouldn't disturb her. She's
gonna need her rest for tomorrow's battle.\c"
Ms017b026,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… It sounds like Enrique and Moegi are
talking. I probably shouldn't disturb them… I'm
sure they want to be alone…\c"
Ms017b027,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Stay up a little while longer.”
“Rest up for the big battle.”\e"
Ms017b028,"\h(«Vyse»)I think I'll stay up a little while longer. I
really don't think I could sleep right now if I
tried, anyway…\c"
Ms017b029,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, tomorrow's the big battle…
I should probably try and get some rest.\c"
Ms017f065,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, I heard a rumor concerning Dangral Island
a little while ago…\e"
Ms017f066,"\h(«Gilder»)According to my sources, Galcian's built some
sort of elevator that leads down beneath the
Great Cloud Sea…\e"
Ms017f067,"\h(«Aika»)Do you think they built it to try and get
to Soltis?!\e"
Ms017f068,"\h(«Gilder»)Probably. And I bet they're heading there with
the Moon Crystals as we speak.\e"
Ms017f069,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, then it looks like we know where we need
to go. Let's try and get to Soltis through
Dangral Island. We need to stop Galcian!\c"
Ms017f073,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Head for the Great Silver Shrine.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms017f074,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… I don't know if we should head to the
Great Silver Shrine right now. Besides, it's
getting a little late, anway…\c"
MSs017b000,"\h(«Vyse»)González……
Encontré el tesoro que estabas buscando.\e"
MSs017b001,"\h(«Vyse»)Pero, para ser sincero,
no era lo que ninguno de los dos esperaba……\c"
MSs017b002,\h(«Vyse»)¡¡Ah!! ¡¡Qué caliente!!\c
MSs017b003,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece que Izmael está repartiendo la madera.
Creo que no debería tocar nada.
Podría estropearlo todo.\c"
MSs017b004,"\h(«Vyse»)Cuando veo cemento me dan ganas de tocarlo y
dejar mis huellas. Pero no debería hacerlo.
A Izmael no le haría mucha gracia.\c"
MSs017b005,"\h(«Vyse»)Está lleno de mezcla de cemento.
¡Ah! ¡Pesa mucho! ¡No puedo moverlo!
¿Y pudo llevarlo Izmael él solito?\c"
MSs017b006,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Qué hay en este barril? ¡Es alquitrán!
¡Vaya, genial……! Se me ha caído un poco
en los pantalones.\c"
MSs017b007,"\h(«Vyse»)Es reconfortante ver de nuevo nuestra bandera
ondeando en el viento.\c"
MSs017b030,"\h(«¿Quieres cambiar la bandera?»)“Cambiarla por el diseño de Aika.”
“Cambiarla por el diseño de Fina.”
“Dejarla como está.”\c"

“Cambiarla por el diseño de Fina.”

“Cambiarla por el diseño de Aika.”
“Dejarla como está.”\c"
MSs017b008,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay alfombras de Nasr, cajas pequeñas……
Todo tipo de cosas en montones desiguales.
De verdad que no sé para qué es todo esto……\c"
MSs017b009,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay piedras pulidas y libros con diseños
extraños. Quizá los usen para predecir
el futuro.\c"
MSs017b010,"\h(«Vyse»)Es un libro lleno de frases con una pinta
muy rara y letras mal escritas.\e"
MSs017b011,"\h(«Vyse»)Me imagino que Marco ha estado aprendiendo
a escribir. Me alegro por él.\c"
MSs017b012,"\h(«Vyse»)Me encanta el olor de las salchichas chamuscadas
en la barbacoa.\c"
MSs017b013,"\h(«Vyse»)Ésta debe de ser la zona donde duerme la
tripulación. De vez en cuando, se oye cómo se
cae alguien de la hamaca por la noche.\c"
MSs017b014,\h(«Vyse»)Ya es suficiente por hoy.\e
MSs017b015,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Dormir un rato.”
“Dar otra vuelta.”\e"
MSs017b016,"\h(«Vyse»)La verdad es que no estoy tan cansado.
No pasa nada si duermo más tarde.\c"
MSs017b017,"\h(«Vyse»)Je, je……
¡Enrique tiene una foto de Moegi en su mesa!\c"
MSs017b018,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Qué es esto?
¡¿Aika tiene una foto mía en su mesa?!
Me da mucha vergüenza……\c"
MSs017b019,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Por qué Fina tiene una foto mía en su mesa?
Me da un poco de vergüenza……\c"
MSs017b020,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece que no hay nadie aquí……
Bueno, es un poco tarde.
Quizá siga echando un vistazo……\c"
MSs017b021,"\h(«Vyse»)Todo el mundo debe de estar descansando
para la gran batalla de mañana.
Debería dejarles dormir……\c"
MSs017b022,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh, Aika no está aquí después de todo.
¿A dónde habrá ido……?\c"
MSs017b023,"\h(«Vyse»)Me pregunto si Aika se habrá ido a dormir ya……
Mmm…… No debería molestarla. Necesita
descansar para la batalla de mañana.\c"
MSs017b024,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina no está en su habitación……
Supongo que no está durmiendo después de todo.
¿Dónde estará?\c"
MSs017b025,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Se habrá ido ya a dormir Fina?
Mmm…… No debería molestarla. Necesita
descansar para la batalla de mañana.\c"
MSs017b026,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece que Enrique y Moegi están hablando.
No debería molestarles.
Seguro que quieren estar solos.\c"
MSs017b027,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Estar despierto un rato más.”
“Descansar para la gran batalla.”\e"
MSs017b028,"\h(«Vyse»)Creo que me quedaré despierto un rato más.
No creo que pueda dormir ahora mismo.\c"
MSs017b029,"\h(«Vyse»)Bueno, mañana es la gran batalla……
Creo que debería intentar dormir un poco.\c"
MSs017f065,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, hace tiempo oí un rumor
sobre Isla Dangral……\e"
MSs017f066,"\h(«Gilder»)Según mis fuentes, Galcian ha construido
una especie de ascensor que te lleva
más allá del mar de Grandes Nubes.\e"
MSs017f067,"\h(«Aika»)¡¿Crees que lo construyeron en un intento
de llegar a Soltis?!\e"
MSs017f068,"\h(«Gilder»)Probablemente. Y seguro que mientras hablamos
ya están de camino con los Cristales Lunares.\e"
MSs017f069,"\h(«Vyse»)Bueno, parece que ya sabemos dónde tenemos que
ir. Intentemos llegar a Soltis por Isla Dangral.
¡Debemos detener a Galcian!\c"
MSs017f073,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Partir hacia el Gran Relicario de Plata.”
“Quedarme aquí un poco más.”\c"
MSs017f074,"\h(«Vyse»)Mmm…… No sé si deberíamos salir hacia
el Gran Relicario de Plata ahora mismo.
Además, se está haciendo tarde……\c"
MFs017b000,"\h(«Vyse»)Gonzales……
J'ai trouvé le trésor que tu cherchais.\e"
MFs017b001,"\h(«Vyse»)Mais, pour être franc, nous ne nous attendions
pas à ça……\c"
MFs017b002,\h(«Vyse»)Oaouh ! Zut ! C'est chaud !!\c
MFs017b003,"\h(«Vyse»)On dirait qu'Izmael est en train de ranger le
bois. Je ne devrais toucher à rien…… Je vais
tout déranger.\c"
MFs017b004,"\h(«Vyse»)Quand je vois du ciment frais j'ai envie d'y
laisser des empreintes. Cependant, je ne devrais
pas. Izmael n'aimerait pas trop ça.\c"
MFs017b005,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est rempli de mortier.
Ngh ! Oh non…… c'est trop lourd ! Je ne peux pas
le bouger d'un centimètre ! Est-ce qu'Izmael l'a
porté tout seul ?\c"
MFs017b006,"\h(«Vyse»)Qu'y a-t-il dans ce tonneau ? Beurk, c'est du
goudron !
Ah c'est parfait…… J'en ai sur les vêtements.\c"
MFs017b007,"\h(«Vyse»)Ça fait plutôt plaisir de voir notre drapeau
flotter au gré du vent……\e"
MFs017b030,"\h(«Changerez-vous le drapeau ?»)“Vous le remplacerez par celui d'Aika.”

MFs017b008,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a des tapis de Nasr, des petites boîtes……
Toutes sortes de choses en pile un peu au
hasard. Je ne sais pas vraiment à quoi tout cela
sert……\c"
MFs017b009,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a des pierres polies et des livres aux
dessins étranges.
Ils servent peut-être à lire la bonne
aventure ?\c"
MFs017b010,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici un livre avec des lignes écrites dans
tous les sens et des lettres mal formées.\e"
MFs017b011,"\h(«Vyse»)Je suppose que Marco doit s'efforcer d'apprendre
à écrire. C'est bien……\c"
MFs017b012,"\h(«Vyse»)J'adore l'odeur des saucisses grillées au feu de
bois……\c"
MFs017b013,"\h(«Vyse»)Ce doit être l'endroit où l'équipage dort.
De temps en temps, on entend quelqu'un
tomber de son hamac dans la nuit.\c"
MFs017b014,\h(«Vyse»)Je crois que ce sera tout pour aujourd'hui……\e
MFs017b015,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“Vous dormirez un peu.”
“Vous vous promènerez un peu plus longtemps.”\e"
MFs017b016,"\h(«Vyse»)En fait, je ne suis pas si fatigué.
Je pourrai toujours dormir plus tard.\c"
MFs017b017,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé hé…… Enrique a une photo de Moegi sur son
bureau !\c"
MFs017b018,"\h(«Vyse»)Quoi ? Aika a une photo de moi sur son bureau.
C'est un peu embarrassant……\c"
MFs017b019,"\h(«Vyse»)Pourquoi fina a-t-elle une photo de moi sur son
bureau ?
C'est un peu gênant……\c"
MFs017b020,"\h(«Vyse»)On dirait qu'il n'y a personne ici……
Bon, il est un peu tard. Je vais peut-être
explorer les environs un peu plus longtemps……\c"
MFs017b021,"\h(«Vyse»)Tout le monde doit se reposer en prévision de la
grande bataille de demain. Je devrais les
laisser dormir……\c"
MFs017b022,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé…… Aika n'est pas ici……
Je me demande où elle a bien pu aller……\c"
MFs017b023,"\h(«Vyse»)Je me demande si Aika est déjà allée se

Hmm…… Je ne devrais pas la déranger. Elle a
besoin de repos avant la bataille de demain.\c"
MFs017b024,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina n'est pas dans sa cabine……
Elle ne doit donc pas dormir.
Je me demande où elle se trouve……\c"
MFs017b025,"\h(«Vyse»)Je me demande si Fina est déjà allée se

Hmm…… Je ne devrais pas la déranger. Elle a
besoin de repos avant la bataille de demain.\c"
MFs017b026,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…… On dirait qu'Enrique et Moegi discutent.
Je ne devrais pas les déranger…… Ils
doivent sûrement vouloir rester seuls……\c"

“Vous vous reposerez pour la grande bataille.”\e"
MFs017b028,"\h(«Vyse»)Je pense que je ne vais pas me coucher de suite.
De toute façon, même si j'essayais, je ne pense
vraiment pas que je pourrais dormir……\c"
MFs017b029,"\h(«Vyse»)Bon, la grande bataille, c'est demain……
Je devrais essayer de me reposer un peu.\c"
MFs017f065,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, il n'y a pas très longtemps, j'ai entendu
des rumeurs au sujet de l'Île de Dangral……\e"
MFs017f066,"\h(«Gilder»)Selon mes sources, Galcian a construit un genre
d'ascenseur qui descend sous le Grand Océan de
Nuages……\e"
MFs017f067,"\h(«Aika»)Crois-tu qu'ils l'ont construit pour essayer
de se rendre à Soltis ?!\e"
MFs017f068,"\h(«Gilder»)Probablement. Et je parie, qu'au moment où je te
parle, ils sont déjà en chemin avec les Cristaux
de Lune.\e"
MFs017f069,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh bien, alors on dirait que nous savons où nous

pour le Grand Temple d'Argent tout de suite.
En plus, il se fait un peu tard……\c"
MGs017b000,"\h(«Vyse»)Gonzales……
Ich habe den Schatz gefunden,
nach dem du gesucht hast.\e"
MGs017b001,"\h(«Vyse»)Aber, um ehrlich zu sein, keiner
von uns beiden hatte das erwartet……\c"
MGs017b002,\h(«Vyse»)Oh! Mann! Das ist heiß!!\c
MGs017b003,"\h(«Vyse»)Scheint so, als sei Izmael dabei,
das Holz zu hobeln. Ich fasse besser
nichts an…… bevor ich etwas kaputt mache.\c"
MGs017b004,"\h(«Vyse»)Immer wenn ich Zement sehe, habe ich
das Verlangen, meinen Fußabdruck zu
hinterlassen. Besser nicht, Izmael würde
es wahrscheinlich nicht mögen.\c"
MGs017b005,"\h(«Vyse»)Es ist mit Zementmischung angefüllt.
Ngh! Mann…… es ist zu schwer! Ich kann
es keinen Zentimeter bewegen! Hat Izmael
das allein getragen?\c"
MGs017b006,"\h(«Vyse»)Was ist in dieser Tonne? Uhh, Teer!
Na super…… Jetzt habe ich was
auf meinen Kleidern.\c"

mögliche, wahllos aufgehäuft. Ich weiß wirklich
nicht, wozu dieses Zeug genau dient……\c"
MGs017b009,"\h(«Vyse»)Polierte Steine und Bücher mit komischen
Designs. Vielleicht werden die zum Wahrsagen
gebraucht?\c"
MGs017b010,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein Buch voll mit wahllos aussehenden
Linien und schlecht geschriebenen Buchstaben.\e"
MGs017b011,"\h(«Vyse»)Schätze, Marco hat versucht schreiben
zu lernen. Gut für ihn……\c"
MGs017b012,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich liebe den Geruch von Bratwürsten
am Kamin……\c"
MGs017b013,"\h(«Vyse»)Das sind wahrscheinlich die Kojen
der Crew. Manchmal kannst du jemanden

von Moegi auf seinem Schreibtisch!\c"

peinlich……\c"

auf ihrem Schreibtisch? Das ist ein bisschen
peinlich……\c"
MGs017b020,"\h(«Vyse»)Scheint niemand hier zu sein……
Nun ja, es ist schon ein bisschen spät.
Vielleicht schaue ich mich noch ein
bisschen mehr um……\c"
MGs017b021,"\h(«Vyse»)Die ruhen sich wahrscheinlich alle für die
große Schlacht morgen aus. Ich sollte sie
besser schlafen lassen……\c"

Wo sie wohl hin ist……\c"
MGs017b023,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich frage mich, ob Aika schon schlafen

sie wahrscheinlich nicht stören. Sie wird die
Ruhe für die morgige Schlacht brauchen.\c"

“Dich zur Ruhe legen für die große Schlacht.”\e"
MGs017b028,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich bleibe noch ein bisschen auf.

selbst wenn ich's versuchen würde……\c"

Ich sollte besser versuchen, mich ein
wenig auszuruhen.\c"
MGs017f065,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, ich habe vor einer Weile
ein Gerücht über Dangral Island
gehört……\e"
MGs017f066,"\h(«Gilder»)Nach meinen Quellen hat Galcian eine
Art Aufzug gebaut, der unter die
Great Cloud Sea führt……\e"
MGs017f067,"\h(«Aika»)Glaubst du, sie haben ihn gebaut,
um nach Soltis zu gelangen?!\e"
MGs017f068,"\h(«Gilder»)Wahrscheinlich. Und ich wette, dass sie
gerade mit den Moon Crystals auf
dem Weg dahin sind, während wir reden.\e"
MGs017f069,"\h(«Vyse»)Nun ja, dann wissen wir ja, wo wir hin
müssen. Lass uns versuchen, durch
Dangral Island nach Soltis zu gelangen.
Wir müssen Galcian stoppen!\c"

wir momentan Richtung Great
Silver Shrine aufbrechen sollten. Außerdem
ist es schon ein bisschen spät……\c"
MJ0220000,"\h(«Vyse»)Modifications to the Delphinus began on that
day.\e"
MJ0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)We needed 10 days to complete our preparations.
Crescent Isle began to bustle with activity…\e"
MJ0220002,"\h(«Vyse»)Using the blueprints that we took from Valua, 
Brabham was hard at work rebuilding the engine
of the Delphinus.\e"
MJ0220003,"\h(«Vyse»)I can't wait to see what Deep Sky looks like 
with my own eyes.\e"
MJ0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)Far beneath the great, blue sky… beneath the 
clouds… I imagine that the atmospheric
pressure must be high…\e"
MJ0220005,"\h(«Vyse»)We must reinforce the Delphinus' hull to make 
sure that it doesn't collapse under the 
pressure…\e"
MJ0220006,"\h(«Vyse»)Ever since that day…
Enrique began to spend more and more time by 
himself.\e"
MJ0220007,"\h(«Vyse»)Looking back…
Losing Gregorio must have been the hardest thing
Enrique has ever faced…\e"
MJ0220008,"\h(«Vyse»)And then, on the tenth day, night fell on 
Crescent Isle… I remember lying awake in my bed
for a long time before I finally fell asleep.\e"
MJ0220009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ugh… I still don't feel rested. Maybe because I
stayed up all night the day before yesterday 
working on the Delphinus…\e"
MJ0220010,"\h(«Vyse»)I should head over to the port.
If everything went according to schedule, 
the modifications should be finished by now.\e"
MSJ0220000,"\h(«Vyse»)Las modificaciones del Delphinus empezaron ese
mismo día.\e"
MSJ0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)Se necesitaban 10 días para acabar los
preparativos. La Isla de la Luna bullía de
actividad……\e"
MSJ0220002,"\h(«Vyse»)Usando los planos que nos llevamos de Valua,
Brabham se dedicó duramente a reconstruir el
motor del Delphinus.\e"
MSJ0220003,"\h(«Vyse»)Estoy impaciente por ver lo que hay en el Cielo
Profundo con mis propios ojos……\e"
MSJ0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)Más abajo del inmenso cielo azul…… por debajo de
las nubes…… Me imagino que la presión
atmosférica será bastante alta……\e"
MSJ0220005,"\h(«Vyse»)Tenemos que reforzar el casco del Delphinus para
asegurarnos de que no se desploma con la
presión……\e"
MSJ0220006,"\h(«Vyse»)A partir de ese día……
Enrique empezó a pasar cada vez más tiempo en
solitario.\e"
MSJ0220007,"\h(«Vyse»)Cuando ahora pienso en ello……
Me doy cuenta de que perder a Gregorio debió ser
lo más duro que le había sucedido……\e"
MSJ0220008,"\h(«Vyse»)Y entonces, en el décimo día, la noche se cernió
sobre la Isla de la Luna…… Recuerdo que pasé
mucho tiempo en la cama tumbado antes de poder
dormirme.\e"
MSJ0220009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ah…… Todavía no he descansado. A lo mejor es
porque anteayer pasé toda la noche despierto
trabajando en el Delphinus……\e"
MSJ0220010,"\h(«Vyse»)Debería ir hacia el puerto.
Si todo ha ido de acuerdo con lo planeado, las
modificaciones deben haber terminado.\e"
MFJ0220000,"\h(«Vyse»)Les modifications du Delphinus débutèrent ce
jour là.\e"
MFJ0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)Il nous fallait 10 jours pour terminer nos
préparations. Tout le monde s'activait sur l'Île
Croissant……\e"
MFJ0220002,"\h(«Vyse»)Grâce aux schémas que nous avions pris à Valua,
Brabham travaillait dur à la reconstruction du
moteur du Delphinus.\e"
MFJ0220003,"\h(«Vyse»)Il me tarde de voir les Profondeurs de mes
propres yeux……\e"
MFJ0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)Loin sous le grand, ciel bleu…… sous les
nuages…… J'imagine que la pression atmosphérique
doit être très élevée……\e"
MFJ0220005,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous devons renforcer la coque du Delphinus pour
qu'il ne s'effondre pas sous la pression……\e"
MFJ0220006,"\h(«Vyse»)Depuis ce jour là……
Enrique se mis à passer de plus en plus de temps
tout seul.\e"
MFJ0220007,"\h(«Vyse»)Quand j'y repense……
Cela a dû être très dur pour Enrique de perdre
Gregorio……\e"
MFJ0220008,"\h(«Vyse»)Et puis, le dixième jour, la nuit tomba sur
l'Île Croissant…… Je me souviens être resté
longtemps allongé sur mon lit avant de pouvoir
m'endormir.\e"
MFJ0220009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ugh…… Je ne me sens pas reposé. C'est peut-être
parce que j'ai passé toute la nuit d'avant à
travailler sur le Delphinus……\e"
MFJ0220010,"\h(«Vyse»)Je devrais rentrer au port.
Si tout se passe comme prévu,
les modifications devraient être terminées.\e"
MGJ0220000,"\h(«Vyse»)Die Arbeiten an der Delphinus begannen an
jenem Tag.\e"
MGJ0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir brauchten 10 Tage, um unsere Vorbereitungen
zu treffen. Auf Crescent Isle
begann fieberhafte Aktivität……\e"
MGJ0220002,"\h(«Vyse»)Unter Verwendung der Pläne, die wir aus Valua
mitgebracht hatten, tat Brabham, was er konnte,
die Motoren der Delphinus zu modifizieren.\e"
MGJ0220003,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich kann's kaum erwarten, mit eigenen Augen
zu sehen, wie Deep Sky aussieht……\e"
MGJ0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)Tief unter dem riesigen, blauen Himmel……
ich kann mir jetzt schon vorstellen, dass
der atmosphärische Druck gewaltig sein muss……\e"
MGJ0220005,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir müssen den Rumpf der Delphinus verstärken,
um sicherzustellen, dass sie nicht unter dem
Druck auseinanderbricht……\e"
MGJ0220006,"\h(«Vyse»)Seit jenem Tag……
……zog es Enrique vor, immer mehr Zeit
allein zu verbringen.\e"
MGJ0220007,"\h(«Vyse»)Wenn man so zurückblickt……
Gregorio zu verlieren, muss das Schlimmste
gewesen sein, was Enrique je widerfahren ist……\e"
MGJ0220008,"\h(«Vyse»)Und dann, am 10. Tag, als es Nacht wurde in
Crescent Isle……  Ich erinnere mich, noch lange
wach gelegen zu haben, bevor ich endlich
einschlief.\e"
MGJ0220009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ach je…… ich bin immer noch nicht ausgeruht.
Vielleicht, weil ich vorgestern die ganze
Nacht wach wahr, um an der Delphinus zu
arbeiten……\e"
MGJ0220010,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich sollte mal zum Hafen hinunter gehen.
Wenn alles nach Plan verlaufen ist, müssten
die Modifikationen jetzt abgeschlossen sein.\e"
ML0040000,\h(«Vyse»)…Who could it be at this time of night?\e
ML0040001,"\h( )It's me, Vyse.\e"
ML0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)Belleza?
What are you doing up at this time of…\e"
ML0040003,"\h(«Belleza»)I…
I've come to say goodbye.\e"
ML0040004,"\h(«Vyse»)Goodbye?!
You're not going to fight with us?\e"
ML0040005,"\h(«Belleza»)I'm afraid not.
You can't expect me to fight my own men.\e"
ML0040006,"\h(«Belleza»)And besides…
There's something else that I have to take care 
of.\e"
ML0040007,\h(«Vyse»)Something else?\e
ML0040008,\h(«Belleza»)……\e
ML0040009,"\h(«Belleza»)…That reminds me.
I took a peek into Aika and Fina's rooms
earlier.\e"
ML0040010,\h(«Belleza»)Neither of them were there.\e
ML0040011,\h(«Vyse»)Huh? Are you serious?\e
ML0040012,"\h(«Belleza»)They were probably unable to sleep… You know…
the night before a battle… They aren't as tough
as they pretend to be… \e"
ML0040013,\h(«Belleza»)A good captain would find them and comfort them.\e
ML0040014,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh, alright.
I'll go check up on them.\e"
ML0040015,\h(«Belleza»)Heh heh… I figured you would.\e
ML0040016,"\h(«Belleza»)Well then…
I must be on my way.\e"
ML0040017,"\h(«Belleza»)I know you'll grow to be a great leader. 
And try not to break too many hearts. 
Goodbye, Vyse.\e"
MSL0040000,\h(«Vyse»)…… ¿Quién será a estas horas de la noche?\e
MSL0040001,"\h( )Soy yo, Vyse.\e"
MSL0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Belleza?
¿Qué haces levantada a estas horas……?\e"
MSL0040003,"\h(«Belleza»)Yo……
Vengo a decir adiós.\e"
MSL0040004,"\h(«Vyse»)¡¿Adiós?!
¿Es que no vas a luchar con nosotros?\e"
MSL0040005,"\h(«Belleza»)Me temo que no.
No puedes pedirme que luche contra mis propios
hombres.\e"
MSL0040006,"\h(«Belleza»)Además……
Hay otra cosa de la que tengo que ocuparme.\e"
MSL0040007,\h(«Vyse»)¿Otra cosa?\e
MSL0040008,\h(«Belleza»)……\e
MSL0040009,"\h(«Belleza»)……Eso me recuerda algo.
He ido a echar un vistazo a la habitación de
Aika y de Fina.\e"
MSL0040010,\h(«Belleza»)Ninguna de ellas estaba ahí.\e
MSL0040011,\h(«Vyse»)¿Eeh? ¿Lo dices en serio?\e
MSL0040012,"\h(«Belleza»)Seguro que no podían dormir…… Ya sabes…… la
noche antes de una batalla…… No son tan duras
como aparentan……\e"
MSL0040013,\h(«Belleza»)Un buen capitán iría a reconfortarlas.\e
MSL0040014,"\h(«Vyse»)Ya.
Iré a ver qué tal están.\e"
MSL0040015,\h(«Belleza»)Sí…… Suponía que lo harías.\e
MSL0040016,"\h(«Belleza»)Bueno……
Tengo que irme.\e"
MSL0040017,"\h(«Belleza»)Sé que acabarás siendo un gran líder.
Intenta no romper muchos corazones.
Adiós, Vyse.\e"
MFL0040000,\h(«Vyse»)……Qui ça peut bien être à cette heure-ci ?\e
MFL0040001,"\h( )C'est moi, Vyse.\e"
MFL0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)Belleza ?
Que faites-vous debout à cette heure de la nuit\e"
MFL0040003,"\h(«Belleza»)Je……
Je suis venue dire au revoir.\e"
MFL0040004,"\h(«Vyse»)Au revoir ?!
Vous ne vous battrez pas avec nous ?\e"
MFL0040005,"\h(«Belleza»)J'ai bien peur que non. Je ne peux pas me battre
contre mes propres hommes.\e"
MFL0040006,"\h(«Belleza»)Et puis……
Je dois m'occuper d'autre chose.\e"
MFL0040007,\h(«Vyse»)Autre chose ?\e
MFL0040008,\h(«Belleza»)……\e
MFL0040009,"\h(«Belleza»)……Ça me fait penser……
J'ai jeté un oeil dans la chambre d'Aika et de
Fina tout à l'heure.\e"
MFL0040010,\h(«Belleza»)Elles n'y étaient pas.\e
MFL0040011,\h(«Vyse»)Hein ? Vous parlez sérieusement ?\e
MFL0040012,"\h(«Belleza»)Elles ne pouvaient sûrement pas dormir…… Vous
savez…… la veille d'une bataille…… elles ne sont
pas aussi fortes qu'elles veulent le faire
croire……\e"
MFL0040013,"\h(«Belleza»)Un bon capitaine irait les trouver pour les
réconforter.\e"
MFL0040014,"\h(«Vyse»)Bon, d'accord.
Je vais aller les voir.\e"
MFL0040015,\h(«Belleza»)Hé hé…… Je m'en doutais.\e
MFL0040016,"\h(«Belleza»)Bon……
Je vais me mettre en route.\e"
MFL0040017,"\h(ｫBellezaｻ)Je sais que vous deviendrez un tr鑚 bon leader.
Et essayez de ne pas briser trop de c忖rs.
Au revoir, Vyse.\e"
MGL0040000,\h(«Vyse»)……Wer könnte das denn noch so spät sein?\e
MGL0040001,"\h( )Ich bin's, Vyse.\e"
MGL0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)Belleza?
Was machst du denn noch so spät……\e"
MGL0040003,"\h(«Belleza»)Ich……
Ich bin gekommen, mich zu verabschieden.\e"
MGL0040004,"\h(«Vyse»)Verabschieden?!
Du kämpfst nicht mit uns?\e"
MGL0040005,"\h(«Belleza»)Leider nicht.
Ihr könnt nicht von mir erwarten, dass ich
meine eigenen Leute bekämpfe.\e"
MGL0040006,"\h(«Belleza»)Und außerdem……
Da ist noch etwas anderes, das ich erledigen
muss.\e"
MGL0040007,\h(«Vyse»)Etwas anderes?\e
MGL0040008,\h(«Belleza»)…………\e
MGL0040009,"\h(«Belleza»)……Da fällt mir was ein.
Ich habe vorhin in Aika und Finas Zimmer
geschaut.\e"
MGL0040010,\h(«Belleza»)Keine von beiden war da.\e
MGL0040011,\h(«Vyse»)Wie? Ist das dein Ernst?\e
MGL0040012,"\h(«Belleza»)Wahrscheinlich konnten sie nicht schlafen……
weißt du…… die Nacht vor einer Schlacht……
sie sind nicht so stark, wie sie uns
weismachen wollen……\e"
MGL0040013,"\h(«Belleza»)Ein guter Kapitän würde sie suchen gehen und
sie trösten.\e"
MGL0040014,"\h(«Vyse»)Also gut.
Ich werde mich um sie kümmern.\e"
MGL0040015,\h(«Belleza»)Haha…… das hab ich mir gedacht.\e
MGL0040016,"\h(«Belleza»)Also, dann……
Ich muss jetzt gehen.\e"
MGL0040017,"\h(«Belleza»)Ich weiß, dass du dich zu einem großen
Anführer entwickeln wirst. Und versuche,
nicht zu viele Herzen zu brechen.
Mach's gut, Vyse.\e"
ML0050000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, Aika.\e"
ML0050001,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, hey Vyse.\e"
ML0050002,"\h(«Aika»)It looked like you were talking to Fina… 
How's she doing?\e"
ML0050003,\h(«Vyse»)She seemed a little worried about tomorrow… \e
ML0050004,"\h(«Aika»)Hm…
Fina, too, huh?\e"
ML0050005,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse?
What are you doing up this late?\e"
ML0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)Shouldn't I be asking you that question? 
What are you doing out here?\e"
ML0050007,"\h(«Aika»)Haha… Good point…
I should answer you first, I suppose…\e"
ML0050008,"\h(«Aika»)I don't know…
I crawled into bed, but I couldn't sleep.\e"
ML0050009,"\h(«Aika»)Maybe I'm just scared.
Heh… This isn't like me, I guess…\e"
ML0050010,"\h(«What will you say to Aika?»)“Hey, I'm scared, too.”
“Yeah, it isn't like you at all…”\e"
ML0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, don't worry about it. I'm scared, too.
Tomorrow is going to be our toughest battle, 
yet.\e"
ML0050012,"\h(«Aika»)Really?
I didn't think you ever got scared.\e"
ML0050013,"\h(«Vyse»)Just because I've been placed in charge of 
tomorrow's assault, doesn't mean that 
I'm not afraid of anything anymore… \e"
ML0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Haha… I'm sorry.
We've been through so much. I guess it's hard 
for me to remember you as the kid next door.\e"
ML0050015,"\h(«Aika»)That makes me feel a little better…
that I'm not the only one who's scared
around here… \e"
ML0050016,"\h(«Aika»)There's a lot riding on tomorrow's battle… 
I guess it's normal to be scared.\e"
ML0050017,"\h(«Vyse»)I feel the same way.
Hey, I'll bet Galcian is scared, too.\e"
ML0050018,"\h(«Aika»)Hahaha!
I bet he is!\e"
ML0050019,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah, it isn't like you at all. Maybe you should
hide under your bed.\e"
ML0050020,"\h(«Aika»)Hey! I said maybe! I didn't come right out and 
say it. And you don't have to make fun of me.\e"
ML0050021,"\h(«Vyse»)I didn't realize that you had a sensitive side, 
too. I think I like it, though.\e"
ML0050022,"\h(«Aika»)…Heh. The only reason why you didn't realize 
that is because every time I try to talk to you,
this is the kind of reaction that I get.\e"
ML0050023,"\h(«Aika»)I'm starting to feel better. Thanks, Vyse. 
You've always known how to cheer me up.\e"
ML0050024,"\h(«Aika»)Maybe I'm just feeling the pressure of 
tomorrow's battle. There's a lot riding on it.\e"
ML0050025,"\h(«Aika»)Maybe I should try to relax. We'll do our best 
and whatever happens, happens… \e"
ML0050026,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah.
Just act like you always do, Aika, and 
everything will be fine.\e"
ML0050027,"\h(«Vyse»)All we have to do is fight like we always do… 
We've done pretty good so far!\e"
ML0050028,\h(«Aika»)Yeah… you're right.\e
ML0050029,"\h(«Aika»)I feel so much better now. Maybe I'll be able to
get some sleep.\e"
ML0050030,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright…
I'll see you tomorrow… \e"
ML0050031,\h(«Aika»)…Okay.\e
ML0050032,"\h(«Aika»)Thanks, Vyse.
We're gonna make history tomorrow!\e"
ML0050033,"\h(«Aika»)Good night!
You better not oversleep! Your dad's here… 
remember?\e"
MSL0050000,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh, Aika.\e"
MSL0050001,"\h(«Aika»)Ah…… Hola, Vyse.\e"
MSL0050002,"\h(«Aika»)Me pareció que hablabas con Fina……
¿Qué tal está?\e"
MSL0050003,\h(«Vyse»)Parecía un poco preocupada por lo de mañana……\e
MSL0050004,"\h(«Aika»)Mm……
Fina también, ¿eh?\e"
MSL0050005,"\h(«Aika»)¿Vyse?
¿Qué haces levantado a estas horas?\e"
MSL0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)¿No te puedo hacer yo la misma pregunta?
¿Y qué haces tú aquí?\e"
MSL0050007,"\h(«Aika»)Ja, ja…… Es verdad……
Supongo que me toca contestar a mí primero……\e"
MSL0050008,"\h(«Aika»)No lo sé……
Me metí en la cama, pero no podía dormirme.\e"
MSL0050009,"\h(«Aika»)A lo mejor es que tengo miedo.
Eh…… Sabes que yo no soy así……\e"
MSL0050010,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decirle a Aika?»)“Tranquila, yo también tengo miedo.”
“Sí, la verdad es que no pareces la de siempre.”\e"
MSL0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)No te preocupes. Yo también estoy asustado.
Mañana va a librarse la batalla más dura.\e"
MSL0050012,"\h(«Aika»)¿En serio?
Creía que tú nunca te asustas.\e"
MSL0050013,"\h(«Vyse»)Sólo porque voy a dirigir la ofensiva de mañana,
no significa que ya no hay nada que me dé miedo
en el mundo……\e"
MSL0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Ja, ja, ja…… Perdona.
Hemos vivido tantas cosas juntos. A veces es
difícil acordarse del chico que eras antes.\e"
MSL0050015,"\h(«Aika»)Me siento mejor……
Sabiendo que no soy la única que tiene miedo……\e"
MSL0050016,"\h(«Aika»)Tantas cosas dependen de la batalla de mañana……
Supongo que es normal tener miedo.\e"
MSL0050017,"\h(«Vyse»)Eso pienso yo.
Eh, qué te apuestas a que Galcian también tiene
miedo.\e"
MSL0050018,"\h(«Aika»)¡Ja, ja, ja!
¡Me apuesto lo que sea!\e"
MSL0050019,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí, la verdad es que no pareces la de siempre.
Por qué no vas a esconderte bajo la cama.\e"
MSL0050020,"\h(«Aika»)¡Eh! ¡Dije que a lo mejor! Lo he dicho con la
boca pequeña y no tienes por qué reírte de mí.\e"
MSL0050021,"\h(«Vyse»)No me había dado cuenta de que también tienes un
lado sensible. Pero me gusta.\e"
MSL0050022,"\h(«Aika»)……La única razón por la que no te habías dado
cuenta es porque cada vez que intento hablar
contigo, me tropiezo con la misma reacción.\e"
MSL0050023,"\h(«Aika»)Estoy mucho mejor que antes. Gracias, Vyse.
Siempre te las arreglas para subirme la moral.\e"
MSL0050024,"\h(«Aika»)A lo mejor es que estoy un poco tensa por la
batalla de mañana. Nos jugamos mucho en esa
batalla.\e"
MSL0050025,"\h(«Aika»)Debería intentar relajarme. Lo haremos lo mejor
que podamos y lo que haya de pasar, pasará……\e"
MSL0050026,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí.
Tú sólo actúa como siempre, Aika, y todo irá
bien.\e"
MSL0050027,"\h(«Vyse»)Lo que tenemos que hacer es luchar, como hemos
hecho siempre……
¡Y hasta ahora nos ha ido muy bien!\e"
MSL0050028,\h(«Aika»)Claro que sí…… tienes razón.\e
MSL0050029,"\h(«Aika»)Me siento mucho mejor ahora. A lo mejor puedo
dormirme.\e"
MSL0050030,"\h(«Vyse»)Muy bien……
Te veré mañana……\e"
MSL0050031,\h(«Aika»)……Vale.\e
MSL0050032,"\h(«Aika»)Muchas gracias, Vyse.
¡Vamos a hacer historia en la batalla de
mañana!\e"
MSL0050033,"\h(«Aika»)¡Buenas noches!
¡Y no te levantes tarde mañana! Tu padre está
aquí…… ¿recuerdas?\e"
MFL0050000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé, Aika.\e"
MFL0050001,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, Vyse.\e"
MFL0050002,"\h(«Aika»)Tu parlais à Fina……
Comment va-t-elle ?\e"
MFL0050003,"\h(«Vyse»)Elle avait l'air un peu inquiète par rapport à
demain……\e"
MFL0050004,"\h(«Aika»)Hum……
Fina, aussi, hein ?\e"
MFL0050005,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse ?
Que fais-tu debout si tard ?\e"
MFL0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est plutôt moi qui devrais te poser la
question ? Que fais-tu là ?\e"
MFL0050007,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… bien vu……
Je devrais répondre la première donc……\e"
MFL0050008,"\h(«Aika»)Je ne sais pas……
Je me suis mise au lit, mais je ne pouvais pas
dormir.\e"
MFL0050009,"\h(«Aika»)Peut-être que j'ai peur, tout simplement.
Hé…… Cela ne me ressemble pas, j'imagine……\e"
MFL0050010,"\h(«Que direz-vous à Aika ?»)“Hé, moi aussi, j'ai peur.”
“Oui, cela ne te ressemble pas du tout……”\e"
MFL0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé, ne t'en fais pas. Moi aussi, j'ai peur.
La bataille de demain sera la plus dure que nous
ayons connue.\e"
MFL0050012,"\h(«Aika»)Vraiment ?
Je ne croyais pas que tu pouvais avoir peur.\e"
MFL0050013,"\h(«Vyse»)Ce n'est pas parce que je mène l'attaque de
demain que je n'ai plus peur de rien……\e"
MFL0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… Je suis désolée.
Nous avons vécu tellement de choses. J'ai du mal
à me souvenir du gamin avec qui j'ai grandi.\e"
MFL0050015,"\h(«Aika»)Ça va un peu mieux……
de savoir que je ne suis pas la seule à avoir
peur……\e"
MFL0050016,"\h(«Aika»)L'avenir de ce monde se jouera dans la bataille
de demain…… C'est normal d'avoir peur.\e"
MFL0050017,"\h(«Vyse»)Je ressens la même chose.
Je parie que Galcian a peur aussi.\e"
MFL0050018,"\h(«Aika»)Hahaha !
Je parie que oui !\e"
MFL0050019,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui, cela ne te ressemble pas. Tu devrais
peut-être te cacher sous ton lit.\e"
MFL0050020,"\h(«Aika»)Hé ! J'ai dit peut-être ! Je n'ai pas vraiment
dit que j'avais peur. Et ce n'est pas la peine
de te moquer de moi.\e"
MFL0050021,"\h(«Vyse»)Je ne savais pas que tu étais aussi sensible.
Mais je crois que cela me plaît.\e"
MFL0050022,"\h(«Aika»)……Hé. Tu ne t'en es jamais rendu compte parce
que chaque fois que j'essaie de te parler,
tu réagis de cette façon.\e"
MFL0050023,"\h(«Aika»)Ça commence à aller mieux. Merci Vyse.
Tu as toujours su me remonter le moral.\e"
MFL0050024,"\h(«Aika»)Peut-être que c'est le stress de la bataille de
demain qui se fait sentir. L'avenir de ce monde
en dépend.\e"
MFL0050025,"\h(«Aika»)Je devrais peut-être essayer de me détendre.
Nous ferons de notre mieux, ce qui doit arriver,
arrivera……\e"
MFL0050026,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui.
Fais comme d'habitude, Aika, et tout ira bien.\e"
MFL0050027,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous n'avons qu'à nous battre comme d'habitude……
Nous nous en sommes bien sortis jusqu'à
présent !\e"
MFL0050028,\h(«Aika»)Oui…… tu as raison.\e
MFL0050029,"\h(«Aika»)Je me sens beaucoup mieux maintenant. Peut-être
que j'arriverai à dormir.\e"
MFL0050030,"\h(«Vyse»)D'accord……
À demain……\e"
MFL0050031,\h(«Aika»)……OK.\e
MFL0050032,"\h(«Aika»)Merci, Vyse.
Demain, nous entrons dans l'histoire !\e"
MFL0050033,"\h(«Aika»)Bonne nuit !
Réveille-toi à l'heure ! Ton père est là……
tu te souviens ?\e"
MGL0050000,"\h(«Vyse»)He, Aika.\e"
MGL0050001,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, hallo, Vyse.\e"
MGL0050002,"\h(«Aika»)Es sah so aus, als hättest du mit Fina
gesprochen…… wie geht es ihr?\e"
MGL0050003,\h(«Vyse»)Sie schien etwas besorgt wegen morgen……\e
MGL0050004,"\h(«Aika»)Hmm……
Sie also auch, wie?\e"
MGL0050005,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse?
Warum bist du zu so später Stunde noch wach?\e"
MGL0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)Das sollte ich dich fragen!
Was machst du hier draußen?\e"
MGL0050007,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… Gute Frage……
Ich nehme an, ich sollte zuerst antworten……\e"
MGL0050008,"\h(«Aika»)Ich weiß nicht……
Ich bin ins Bett gekrochen, aber ich konnte
nicht schlafen.\e"
MGL0050009,"\h(«Aika»)Vielleicht habe ich bloß Angst.
He…… Schätze, es sieht mir nicht ähnlich……\e"
MGL0050010,"\h(«Was wirst du Aika sagen?»)“He, ich hab auch Angst”.
“Ja, das sieht dir gar nicht ähnlich……”\e"
MGL0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)He, mach dir keine Sorgen. Ich habe auch Angst.
Morgen steht uns die schwerste Schlacht bevor,
die wir je hatten.\e"
MGL0050012,"\h(«Aika»)Ach ja?
Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass du es je mit der
Angst bekommst.\e"
MGL0050013,"\h(«Vyse»)Nur weil man mich zum Anführer des morgigen
Angriffs gemacht hat, bedeutet noch lange nicht,
dass ich mich vor nichts mehr fürchte……\e"
MGL0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… tut mir leid.
Wir haben so viel durchgemacht. Schätze, es
fällt mir schwer, dich noch als meinen kleinen
Spielkameraden zu sehen.\e"
MGL0050015,"\h(«Aika»)Jetzt fühle ich mich schon besser……
weil ich hier nicht die Einzige bin, die
Angst hat……\e"
MGL0050016,"\h(«Aika»)Von der morgigen Schlacht hängt sehr viel ab……
Ich denke, da ist es normal, Angst zu haben.\e"
MGL0050017,"\h(«Vyse»)Du sagst es.
He, ich möchte wetten, Galcian hat auch Angst.\e"
MGL0050018,"\h(«Aika»)Hahaha!
Mit Sicherheit!\e"
MGL0050019,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, das sieht dir gar nicht ähnlich. Vielleicht
solltest du dich unterm Bett
verstecken.\e"
MGL0050020,"\h(«Aika»)He! Ich habe vielleicht gesagt! So war das auch
wieder nicht gemeint. Und du sollst dich nicht
lustig über mich machen.\e"
MGL0050021,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich wusste gar nicht, dass du auch so sensibel
sein kannst. Aber es gefällt mir.\e"
MGL0050022,"\h(«Aika»)……He, der einzige Grund, weshalb du das bisher
nicht gemerkt hast, ist, dass du jedesmal so
reagierst, wenn ich versuche, mit dir zu reden.\e"
MGL0050023,"\h(«Aika»)Ich fühle mich schon etwas besser. Danke, Vyse.
du hast schon immer gewusst, wie du mich
aufmuntern kannst.\e"
MGL0050024,"\h(«Aika»)Vielleicht ist das der Druck der morgigen
Schlacht. Es hängt viel davon ab.\e"
MGL0050025,"\h(«Aika»)Vielleicht sollte ich mich ein wenig entspannen.
Wir werden unser Bestes tun, und was auch
immer passiert, das passiert……\e"
MGL0050026,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja.
Sei einfach so, wie du immer bist, Aika, und
alles wird gut.\e"
MGL0050027,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir müssen einfach so kämpfen, wie wir es
immer tun…… Bisher waren wir doch gar nicht so
schlecht!\e"

My… my whole life, we were always together… 
We were best friends… \e"
