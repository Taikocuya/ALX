M08000000,\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Come right on in! What can I get for you?\e
M08000001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about this and that.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08000002,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Tenkou is the name of a gang of outlaws. They go
around seizing weapons, spouting something about
how bare hands are more powerful.\e"
M08000003,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)You say you ran into a Tenkou?
You're lucky you got away without losing your
weapons or your life.\e"
M08000004,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08000005,\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Come right on in! What can I get for you?\e
M08000006,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about this and that.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08000007,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)I don't suppose you folks knew this, but the
chief of the Tenkou gang is one extremely strong
guy.\e"
M08000008,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)You know those two twins you guys defeated? Well
I hear this guy got to be chief by brushing them
aside like a couple of babies.\e"
M08000009,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08000010,\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Come right on in! What can I get for you?\e
M08000011,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about this and that.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08000012,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)So you overpowered that hateful Kangan.
That certainly gets a load off of my chest.
You're a man to be reckoned with! \e"
M08000013,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Hey, you know what? There's this isolated island
way up north, straight north of here.
I think you should go there.\e"
M08000014,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)I've heard there's a guy living there called
Ryu-kan. He's supposed to be a really phenomenal
swordsmith.\e"
M08000015,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Thanks for stopping by! You come on back, now,
you hear?\e"
M08010000,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)Well, my, my. What can I do for you?\e"
M08010001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M08010002,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)The Great Wall that surrounds this island was
built by our ancestors in order to protect the
country.\e"
M08010003,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)But the Great Wall isn't what really protects
us.
What really protects us is the Blue Winds.\e"
M08010004,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)All right, then. Please come again.\e"
M08010005,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)They say a fleet of black steel ships has come,
but there's really nothing to worry about.
Nah, everything's going to be just fine.\e"
M08010006,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)When the time comes, the Blue Winds will blow
and save us. It has protected our country since
ancient times, and it won't fail us now.\e"
M08010007,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)Now I've had a good look at you, you're quite a
handsome fellow, aren't you? If only I were 70
years younger… Oh, my! What am I talking about!\e"
M08010008,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)Look what you've made a poor old woman say, you
naughty little boy, you. My face is scarlet…\c"
M08010009,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)When I was young, everyone was quite taken with
Lord Mikado, but nowadays it's Prince Daigo.\e"
M08010010,"\h(«Elderly Item Merchant»)Oh, my! Look what you've made a poor old woman
say, you naughty little boy, you.
I'm so embarrassed. My face is burning…\e"
M08030000,"\h(«Urala»)Oh! Please come in!
What can I get you?\e"
M08030001,"\h(«Aika»)Looks like they have waitresses in Yafutoma,
too! \e"
M08030002,\h(«Urala»)Waitr…? \e
M08030003,"\h(«Urala»)I, I'm sorry.
We don't have anything like that on hand.\e"
M08030004,"\h(«Aika»)A ha ha ha. You misunderstood!
We were talking about you.\e"
M08030005,\h(«Urala»)Huh…?\e
M08030006,"\h(«Urala»)Oh. I, I'm sorry.
I, I thought it was what you wanted to order.\e"
M08030007,"\h(«Aika»)Don't mention it. We're the ones who should
apologize. We're in a bit of a rush right now,
but we'll come back some other time, okay?\e"
M08030008,"\h(«Urala»)Al, alright.
Um… Thank you for coming in.\e"
M08030009,"\h(«Urala»)N, next time you come, be sure to try our
scrumptious dumplings as well as our piping hot
sweetbean soup.\e"
M08030010,"\h(«Vyse»)… Say,
are you by any chance Kirala's little sister?\e"
M08030011,"\h(«Urala»)Y, yes… I am.
But why do you ask?\e"
M08030012,"\h(«Aika»)I thought so!
Actually, Kirala has decided to join the crew of
our ship as a builder.\e"
M08030013,"\h(«Aika»)We're wondering if you might be interested in
joining our crew, too.\e"
M08030014,"\h(«Urala»)Me? B, but…
unlike my sister, I'm not good for much of
anything besides cooking.\e"
M08030015,"\h(«Vyse»)Cooking is a perfectly fine skill to have.
How would you like to join our crew as a cook?\e"
M08030016,"\h(«Urala»)S, sure, okay.
If my sister's joining too.
But are you sure I qualify for the job?\e"
M08030017,"\h(«Vyse»)Of course you do.
You can make us all kinds of tasty Yafutoman
dishes.\e"
M08030018,"\h(«Urala»)W, well!
Um… I, I'll really do my best.
Thank you so much.\e"
M08030019,\h( )Urala has joined your crew as a “Cook.”\c
M08030020,"\h(«Urala»)Um… When you're not busy,
please feel free to drop in any time.\e"
M08030021,"\h(«Urala»)Oh. You were here the other day, weren't you?
Welcome back.\e"
M08030022,"\h(«Aika»)Hi! Excuse me,
but would you happen to be Kirala's little
sister by any chance?\e"
M08030023,"\h(«Urala»)Y, yes… I am.
But why do you ask?\e"
M08030024,"\h(«Aika»)I thought so!
Actually, Kirala has decided to join the crew of
our ship as a builder.\e"
M08030025,"\h(«Aika»)We're wondering if you might be interested in
joining our crew, too.\e"
M08030026,"\h(«Urala»)Me? B, but…
unlike my sister, I'm not good for much of
anything besides cooking.\e"
M08030027,"\h(«Vyse»)Cooking is a perfectly fine skill to have.
How would you like to join our crew as a cook?\e"
M08030028,"\h(«Urala»)S, sure, okay.
If my sister's joining too.
But are you sure I qualify for the job?\e"
M08030029,"\h(«Vyse»)Of course you do.
You can make us all kinds of tasty Yafutoman
dishes.\e"
M08030030,"\h(«Urala»)A, alright!
Um… I, I'll really do my best.
Thank you so much.\e"
M08030031,\h( )Urala has joined your crew as a “Cook.”\c
M08040000,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)We serve the best tea and dumplings here, and
thanks to Urala, we've also got the most popular
teahouse in town. \e"
M08040001,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)I don't suppose you Westerners can taste the
difference, though.
A hah hah.\e"
M08040002,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)Did I hear that a throng of Westerners have
come to town? Sounds like the perfect chance to
spread the word about our tasty dumplings.\e"
M08040003,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)Though I don't suppose Westerners have such
discriminating tastebuds as to tell the
difference. A hah hah.\e"
M08040004,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)It's a shame we never had a chance to serve the
Westerners our delectable dumplings.
We missed out on a great business opportunity.\e"
M08040005,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)If you guys had just taken it a little easier,
we could have had them taste our dumplings.\e"
M08040006,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)Now that Urala is leaving here, it feels
like a part of this place is leaving with
her. She brought so much life to this place.\e"
M08040007,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)Without her… this place will feel so empty.
But, she is free to live her own life. I wish
her the best of luck.\c"
M08040008,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)Now that Urala is leaving here, it feels
like a part of this place is leaving with
her. She brought so much life to this place.\e"
M08040009,"\h(«Teahouse Owner»)Without her… this place will feel so empty.
But, she is free to live her own life. I wish
her the best of luck.\c"
M08050000,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)That girl Urala who works here is an excellent
cook and seems very domestic, but she's rather
reserved and bashful.\e"
M08050001,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)By contrast, her older sister is the assertive
type, and a very skilled builder as well.
They're polar opposites, really.\e"
M08050002,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)If you were to ask which I'd prefer for a wife…
well… it's a really tough choice.\e"
M08050003,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)Would I choose the domestic Urala, or the more
out-going Kirala? I'm afraid I really don't know
how to rank them one over the other.\e"
M08050004,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)What's that?
You say some foreign ships have come into port?
Now hold on just a minute. \e"
M08050005,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)At times like this, you can't let yourself
panic; you have to keep your calm. To wit, it's
best to start by having a quiet cup of tea…\e"
M08050006,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)The truth of the matter is, I'm so flabbergasted
that I've lost my legs.
But don't tell that to Urala. \e"
M08050007,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)Please don't tell Urala that I've lost my legs
and can't stand up.\e"
M08050008,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)What's that?
You chased off the foreign ships?
Well done!\e"
M08050009,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)By the way, stranger.
Please don't tell Urala that I… behaved a
little cowardly…\e"
M08050010,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)I am not surprised that after learning her older
sister, Kirala, would be leaving with you, that
she, too, decided to leave.\e"
M08050011,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)But to think that two of the most beautiful
women in all of Yafutoma will be leaving at the
same time is very saddening…\c"
M08050012,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)I'm sure that no matter where Urala is, she will
always be able to cook amazing food.\e"
M08050013,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)Urala is very skilled at cooking using a fish
called “Romuhai fish.” Perhaps you should try
some of her special dishes someday.\c"
M08050014,"\h(«Teahouse Customer»)Urala is very skilled at cooking using a fish
called “Romuhai fish.” Perhaps you should try
some of her special dishes someday.\c"
M08100000,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)This land of Yafutoma is a beautiful country of 
countless islands large and small lying beneath 
the Blue Moon. \e"
M08100001,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Oh, visitor from the distant west! May you taste
our bountiful water and breathe our clear, crisp
air till your heart's content.\e"
M08100002,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)And when you decide to go to Mt. Kazai, please 
make your way to the ship parts dealer located 
down near the waterfront. \e"
M08100003,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)I have already spoken to him about escorting you
folks to Mt. Kazai. \e"
M08100004,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)When you decide to go to Mt. Kazai, please make 
your way to the ship parts dealer located down 
near the waterfront. \e"
M08100005,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)I have already spoken to him about escorting you
folks to Mt. Kazai. \e"
M08100006,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Ahh, you folks, there! Lord Mikado has been
waiting for you. Please, please. Come right this
way.\c"
M08100007,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Ahh, you folks, there! I have heard that a fleet
of foreign ships has gathered off shore.
Can you tell me what it is about?\e"
M08100008,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Ahh, you folks, there! The Divine Wind really 
did blow, did it not? The legend has proved to 
be true!\e"
M08100009,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Ahh, you folks, there! Take care that you don't 
become a burden to Prince Daigo.\e"
M08110000,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)My apologies. I did not realize that you were
persons whom Lord Mikado wished to see.\e"
M08110001,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)However, since it is my job to protect the state
and restore order, I beg you to overlook any
offense I may have caused. \e"
M08110002,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)I must say, it is quite scandalous how much skin
your apparel leaves exposed. You Westerners
must really be shameless people.\e"
M08110003,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)That is… I mean… perhaps “shameless” was
rather too strong of a word. I beg you to
overlook any offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110004,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)That is… I mean… perhaps “shameless” was
rather too strong of a word. I beg you to
overlook any offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110005,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Hark! Could that be the Maga Sphere? I never
would have believed that mere children could
find it and actually bring it back. \e"
M08110006,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)That is… I mean… I didn't mean that… um… you
are mere children. I beg you to overlook any
offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110007,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)I understand a fleet of black steel ships has 
come into port. I wonder if I can't sneak out 
somehow to go have a look…\e"
M08110008,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)That is… I mean… It was indiscreet of me to
say such a thing. I beg you to overlook any
offense it may have caused.\e"
M08110009,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)Ever since you folks showed up, we've had a
civil war, and dealt with that bird monster that
appeared out of nowhere…\c"
M08110010,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)And we've had nothing but trouble… I mean, that
is, I'm joking. To put it another way…\e"
M08110011,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)We've had a lot of difficulties, one after
another. But they must have all been good omens,
since Prince Daigo is back with us once again.\c"
M08110012,"\h(«Yafutoman Soldier»)We've had a lot of difficulties, one after
another. But they must have all been good omens,
since Prince Daigo is back with us once again.\c"
M08170000,"\h(«Big Sister»)Come on! Hurry up and get in! You said you'd
practice sailing in this tub ship!\e"
M08170001,"\h(«Big Sister»)If you can't even sail a tub ship, you're never
going to be able to help search for Prince
Daigo.\c"
M08170002,"\h(«Big Sister»)There's a whole fleet of strange ships in the
harbor. We don't have a chance like this very
often, so let's go see them.\e"
M08170003,"\h(«Big Sister»)There's no reason to be afraid. You're not
afraid of the foreigner in the blue suit, are
you?\c"
M08170004,"\h(«Big Sister»)Prince Daigo beat up all of the outlaws and came
back home!\e"
M08170005,"\h(«Big Sister»)Oh. They say he's putting on some clean clothes.
I sure wish I could hurry up and play with him!\c"
M08170006,"\h(«Big Sister»)Anyway, it's about time you at least learned to
sail a tub ship!\c"
M08180000,"\h(«Young Man»)Hello. You must be one of those Westerners I've
heard about. It's really true that you don't
have black eyes and hair, isn't it?!\e"
M08180001,"\h(«Young Man»)My dream is to bring lots of Westerners like
you to this country as tourists. \e"
M08180002,"\h(«Young Man»)I want people from all over the world to see our
picturesque Mt. Kazai.\e"
M08180003,"\h(«Young Man»)Really! Can there be any sight more picturesque
than this? And just look at what perfect weather
it is today!\e"
M08180004,"\h(«Young Man»)How I'd like to be able to show this splendid
view to other visitors from your country!\e"
M08180005,"\h(«Young Man»)A huge fleet of ships, such as I've never seen
before, passed by near hear.\e"
M08180006,"\h(«Young Man»)I wonder if they could be tourists?
Perhaps the beauty of our fair country is
finally becoming known to the Westerners.\e"
M08180007,"\h(«Young Man»)Hello. You must be one of those Westerners I've
heard about. It's really true that you don't
have black eyes and hair, isn't it?!\e"

view to other visitors from your country!\e"
M08190000,"\h(«Little Sister»)Nooo! I don't want to practice sailing! I don't
care if I can't sail a tub ship!\e"
M08190001,"\h(«Little Sister»)Prince Daigo will come back home by himself just
fine, even if I don't go searching for him!\c"
M08190002,"\h(«Little Sister»)No, I won't go. I don't care about the foreign
ships.\e"
M08190003,"\h(«Little Sister»)But I'd be too scared! What if the foreigners
kidnapped us and took us away?\c"
M08190004,"\h(«Little Sister»)Prince Daigo finally came home, but now they say
Princess Moegi is going somewhere.\e"
M08190005,"\h(«Little Sister»)I'm going to be so lonesome when the nice
princess goes away. Sniffle sniffle.\c"
M08190006,\h(«Little Sister»)Nooo! I don't care if I can't sail a tub ship!\c
M08200000,\h(«Koketa»)Cluck cluck! Cluck! \e
M08200001,"\h(«What's with this bird?»)“Looks tasty!”
“It's kind of cute!”
“Go away! Shoo! Shoo!”\e"
M08200002,"\h(«Vyse»)This bird… looks rather tasty, don't you think?\e"
M08200003,\h(«Koketa»)Looks tasty! Looks tasty!\c

Don't you go teaching it any naughty words, now,

“Hablar de esto y lo otro.”
“Salir.”\e"
MS08000002,"\h(«Mercader de Armas»)Los Tenkou son un grupo de proscritos.
Van por ahí confiscando armas y diciendo
que las manos desnudas son la mejor arma.\e"
MS08000003,"\h(«Mercader de Armas»)¿Así que tropezásteis con un Tenkou?
Tenéis suerte de haber salido de ahí sin que os
hayan quitado las armas o incluso la vida.\e"
MS08000004,"\h(«Mercader de Armas»)¡Gracias por venir!
Volved pronto, ¿de acuerdo?\e"
MS08000005,\h(«Mercader de Armas»)¡Pasad sin miedo! ¿Qué queréis?\e

“Hablar de esto y lo otro.”
“Salir.”\e"
MS08000007,"\h(«Mercader de Armas»)Supongo que no lo sabéis, pero el jefe de la
banda Tenkou es increíblemente fuerte.\e"
MS08000008,"\h(«Mercader de Armas»)¿Os acordáis de esos gemelos que derrotasteis?
Pues dicen que este hombre se convirtió en el
jefe después quitarlos de en medio como si nada.\e"

MS08000012,"\h(«Mercader de Armas»)O sea que has ganado a ese odioso Kangan.
No sabes el peso que eso me quita de encima.
¡Eres una persona excepcional!\e"
MS08000013,"\h(«Mercader de Armas»)¿Sabes qué? En dirección Norte, muy al Norte,
hay una isla alejada.
Creo que debes ir allí.\e"
MS08000014,"\h(«Mercader de Armas»)Dicen que allí hay vive un tal Ryu-kan. Por lo
visto es un forjador de espadas fabuloso.\e"

“Hablar de temas variados.”
“Salir.”\e"
MS08010002,"\h(«Anciana Vendedora de Objetos»)El Gran Muro que rodea esta isla fue construido
por nuestros antepasados para proteger al país.\e"
MS08010003,"\h(«Anciana Vendedora de Objetos»)Pero el Gran Muro no es lo que nos protégé
realmente.
En realidad nos protegen los Vientos Azules.\e"

MS08010005,"\h(«Anciana Vendedora de Objetos»)Dicen que ha aparecido una flota de navíos
negros, pero no hay nada de qué preocuparse.
Seguro que todo va sobre ruedas.\e"

Azules y nos salvarán. Han protegido nuestro
país desde la antigüedad, no va a fallar ahora.\e"

aus dem Westen den Unterschied bemerken würdet.
A hah hah.\e"
MG08040002,"\h(«Teehaus-Eigentümer»)Ob ich gehört habe, dass eine Schar Westler
in die Stadt gekommen ist? Das scheint eine
gute Chance zu sein, überall zu verbreiten, wie
gut unsere Klöße schmecken.\e"
MG08040003,"\h(«Teehaus-Eigentümer»)Obwohl ich ja nicht glaube, dass Leute aus
dem Westen so feine Geschmacksnerven besitzen,
um einen Unterschied festzustellen.
A hah hah.\e"
MG08040004,"\h(«Teehaus-Eigentümer»)Es ist schade, dass wir den Leuten aus dem
Westen nie unsere köstlichen Klöße vorsetzen
konnten. Da haben wir ein erstklassiges
Geschäft verpasst.\e"
MG08040005,"\h(«Teehaus-Eigentümer»)Wenn ihr euch nicht so aufgeführt hättet,
hätten sie unsere Klöße kosten können.\e"
MG08040006,"\h(«Teehaus-Eigentümer»)Jetzt, wo Urala von hier fortgeht, ist es,
als ob ein Teil von hier mit ihr geht. Sie
hat so viel Leben in diesen Laden gebracht.\e"
MG08040007,"\h(«Teehaus-Eigentümer»)Ohne sie…… wird es hier sehr einsam sein.
Aber es steht ihr frei, ihr eigenes Leben zu
leben. Ich wünsche ihr alles Gute.\c"

MG08050000,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Urala, das Mädchen, das hier arbeitet, ist
eine gute Köchin und scheint sehr häuslich zu
sein, aber sie ist ziemlich reserviert und
auch schüchtern.\e"
MG08050001,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Im Gegensatz dazu ist ihre Schwester sehr
selbstbewusst und noch dazu eine gute
Baumeisterin Sie sind beide total verschieden.\e"
MG08050002,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Wenn Sie mich fragen, welche von beiden
ich gern als Frau hätte…… also…… das lässt
sich wirklich nicht so leicht sagen.\e"
MG08050003,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Sollte es die häusliche Urala oder aber die
lebhaftere Kirala sein? Ich kann wirklich
nicht sagen, für wen ich mich entscheiden
würde.\e"
MG08050004,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Was ist das?
Ihr sagt, ausländische Schiffe seien in den
Hafen eingefahren? Also, Moment mal.\e"
MG08050005,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)In Zeiten wie diesen darf man nicht die
Nerven verlieren; man muss die Ruhe bewahren.
Das heißt, man trinkt am Besten erstmal eine
Tasse Tee……\e"
MG08050006,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Um die Wahrheit zu sagen, ich bin so verblüfft,
dass ich meine Beine verloren habe.
Aber sagt das nicht Urala.\e"
MG08050007,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Bitte sagt Urala nicht, dass ich keine
Beine mehr habe und nicht aufstehen kann.\e"
MG08050008,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Was ist los?
Ihr habt die ausländischen Schiffe verjagt?
Gut gemacht!\e"
MG08050009,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Übrigens, Fremdling……
Bitte erzähle Urala nicht, dass ich……
mich so wie ein Feigling benommen habe……\e"
MG08050010,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Es überrascht mich nicht, dass sie sich dafür
entschieden hat, fortzugehen, nachdem
sie hörte, dass ihre Schwester Kirala mit
euch mitfährt.\e"
MG08050011,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Aber wenn man bedenkt, dass zwei der schönsten
Frauen in ganz Yafutoma zur gleichen Zeit
fortgehen, ist das schon traurig……\c"
MG08050012,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Ich bin sicher, egal, wo sich Urala aufhält,
sie kocht überall tolle Sachen.\e"
MG08050013,"\h(«Teehaus-Kunde»)Urala ist für die Zubereitung von “Romuhai-
Fisch” bekannt. Vielleicht solltet ihr bei

ausprobieren.\c"

entschuldigen.\e"
MG08110002,"\h(«Yafutomanischer Soldat»)Ich muss sagen, es ist schon ziemlich skandalös,
wie viel bloße Haut eure Kleidung offenbart.
Ihr Leute aus dem Westen müsst in der Tat
schamlos sein.\e"

Ich bitte euch, nicht Anstoß zu nehmen.\e"

runterschleichen und mal nachschauen……\e"

so etwas zu sagen. Ich hoffe, ich habe euch
nicht gekränkt.\e"

natürlich ein Scherz. Um es anders

Du fürchtest dich doch nicht etwa vor einem

workout for your arms…\c"
Ms019b001,"\h(«Vyse»)I can't read Yafutoman, but there's a picture of
a little tub. I assume that it means that this
is the place to rent tub-boats, then…\c"
Ms019b002,"\h(«Vyse»)There's something written in Yafutoman…
Hmm… I'm not sure, but it probably says
something about this switch here.\c"
Ms019b003,"\h(«Vyse»)This looks a little like a game we have back
home… but the game pieces look different. I
wonder how you place this game…\c"
Ms019b004,"\h(«Vyse»)Why is there a sculpture of a turtle here?
Do the Yafutomans worship turtles or something?
\c"
Ms019b005,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow… There sure are some strange weapons here.
Some of the weapons look similar to the ones
back home, but others I've never seen before.\c"
Ms019b006,"\h(«Vyse»)Huh? This umbrella's made of paper!
How could you stay dry with a paper umbrella?!\c"
Ms019b007,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow… The Yafutomans sure make a lot of
different things out of paper. I wonder if they
have paper boats and weapons and stuff?\c"
Ms019b008,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a river running through the middle of
the room and even a little waterwheel. It's
sort of relaxing…\c"
Ms019b009,"\h(«Vyse»)There's some sort of dark sauce inside here.
I wonder what it's made of… It smells… sort
of salty-sweet.\c"
Ms019b010,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this? It looks sort of like a tombstone…
I can't read what's written on it, though. I
should probably just leave it alone.\c"

en estos pequeños carcamanes? Sin duda
parece un buen ejercicio para los brazos.\c"

una foto de un pequeño navío. Deduzco que

¿En Yafutoma veneran a las tortugas?\c"

probablement question de cet interrupteur.\c"

Je me demande comment on joue à ce jeu……\c"
MFs019b005,"\h(«Vyse»)Oaouh…… Il y a des armes bien étranges ici.
Certaines de ces armes sont similaires à celles
que nous avons chez nous, mais je n'ai jamais vu
les autres auparavant.\c"

Comment faire pour rester au sec avec un
parapluie en papier ?!\c"
MFs019b007,"\h(«Vyse»)Oaouh…… Les Yafutomans fabriquent toutes sortes
de choses avec du papier. Je me demande s'ils
ont aussi des bateaux et des armes en papier ?\c"
MFs019b008,"\h(«Vyse»)Une rivière coule au milieu de la pièce et il y
a même une petite roue hydraulique.
C'est plutôt reposant……\c"
MFs019b009,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a une sorte de sauce brune à l'intérieur.
Je me demande de quoi c'est fait…… Il y a une
odeur de…… sucré-salé.\c"
MFs019b010,"\h(«Vyse»)Qu'est-ce que c'est ? On dirait un genre de
pierre tombale……

mit Sicherheit ein gutes Training für

MGs019b001,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich kann kein Yafutomanisch lesen, aber da ist
ein Bild mit einem kleinen Kahn. Schätze,
das bedeutet,  man kann hier Kähne mieten……\c"
MGs019b002,"\h(«Vyse»)Da steht etwas in Yafutomanisch……
Hmm…… Bin mir nicht sicher, aber
es bezieht sich wahrscheinlich auf den
Schalter hier.\c"
MGs019b003,"\h(«Vyse»)Das sieht ein bisschen wie ein Spiel aus,
das wir zu Huase spielen…… Aber die Steine
sehen anders aus. Ich frage mich, wie die
Aufstellung ist……\c"
MGs019b004,"\h(«Vyse»)Warum ist hier eine Skulptur einer Schildkröte?
Beten die Yafutomaner Schildkröten oder so an?\c"
MGs019b005,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow…… Es gibt wirklich seltsame Waffen
hier. Einige sehen so aus wie zu Hause, andere
wiederum habe ich noch nie gesehen.\c"
MGs019b006,"\h(«Vyse»)Huh? Dieser Schirm ist aus Papier gemacht!
Wie soll man denn unter einem Papierschirm
trocken bleiben?!\c"
MGs019b007,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow…… Die Yafutomaner machen wirklich
viele verschiedene Dinge aus Papier. Frage mich,
ob die auch Boote und Waffen und so Sachen
aus Papier haben?\c"
MGs019b008,"\h(«Vyse»)Da fließt ein Fluss mitten durchs Zimmer,
und da, sogar ein kleines Wasserrad. Es ist
irgendwie entspannend……\c"
MGs019b009,"\h(«Vyse»)Hier ist eine Art dunkler Soße drin.
Woraus die wohl ist……
Riecht irgendwie salzig-süß.\c"
MGs019b010,"\h(«Vyse»)Was ist das? Sieht irgendwie aus wie ein
Grabstein…… Kann leider nicht lesen, was drauf
