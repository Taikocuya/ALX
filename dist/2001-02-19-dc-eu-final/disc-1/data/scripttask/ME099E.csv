M80200000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M80200001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M80200002,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M81200000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)We are the Nasr Air Guard. Our primary
responsibility is to defend Nasrad from
invaders.\e"
M81200001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)In order for the Valuan Armada to invade us,
they will have to go through the strait.\c"
M80210000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M80210001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M80210002,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M81210000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)Hah! The Valuans are overconfident. They think
their Armada is unstoppable. Let them try to get
past us.\e"
M81210001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)It doesn't matter how many ships they have. If
they try to rush through the strait, we'll just
pick them off.\c"
M90010000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)This region of the sky is like a giant maze.
There are sky rifts and islands all over the
place.\e"
M90010001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)We need to be careful around here. There are
lots of spots where Air Pirates can hide and
ambush us.\c"
M90010002,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Shrine Island? Forget it. No one in their right
mind would go near the place.\e"
M90010003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I've heard that there are monsters on that
island, and if you fly close enough, you can
hear them at night when the winds are still.\c"
M90010004,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)It was incredible! I heard this really loud
rumble, and my ship started shaking. I looked
over the side…\e"
M90010005,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)… I saw a whole fleet of Valuan warships. I
wonder where they were going. With a fleet that
large, they must have been attacking someone.\c"
M90010006,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)If you're looking for Sailors' Island, it's
northeast of here. Just look for the
lighthouse… it'll guide you to the port.\e"
M90010007,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You'll see it right after you go through the
rock tunnel.\c"
M90010008,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)From what I hear, Valua has added another
admiral to it's ranks. That makes six main
fleets in the Armada now.\e"
M90010009,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)With that many ships, they must be up to
something. I wouldn't want to get on their bad
side.\c"
M90010010,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Where'd you get that ship?! I've never seen a
ship like that before!\e"
M90010011,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Wait a second… That's a Valuan Ship! You stole
it!!! You're either very brave… or very
stupid!\c"
M90010012,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Is that right? There's really a land called
Yafutoma in the far east?\e"
M90010013,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)What?! You say you can reach Yafutoma by going
west, too? Wait… I don't get it…\c"
M90010014,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I can't believe it… Valua has been completely
destroyed. You can still smell the smoke at 100
leagues, if you're downwind.\c"
M90020000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Say, you must be members of the infamous Dyne
Clan. We've been hearing a lot about you guys
lately!\e"
M90020001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)We hear you've been really stirring things up
over in Valua. Keep up the good work.
We're behind you all the way.\c"
M90020002,\h(«Merchant Ship»)I saw a Moon Stone hit Shrine Island yesterday.\e
M90020003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)That stone is as good as gone. You'd have to be
crazy to go after it. Shrine Island is haunted,
you know.\c"
M90020004,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You're going to Valua? Just head north from
here. It should be easy to find. But, you'll
need a passport to get in.\e"
M90020005,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Passports are usually only issued to a very
small number of merchants who are permitted to
trade with Valua.\c"
M90020006,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I just heard that the Ship Parts Merchant in
Sailors' Island just got in a shipment of
Secondary Cannons.\e"
M90020007,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)All of the stores in Sailors' Island get regular
shipments of new goods every now and then. You
should check back there often.\c"
M90020008,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)A Valuan ship! Please spare me! I have done
nothing wrong! I have a family to feed!!\e"
M90020009,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)What? You're Air Pirates? Heh… You scared me
there for a second. But wait… I suppose I
should still be scared, huh?\c"
M90020010,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You said you sailed around the world? Ha! Yeah,
right! What kind of fool do you take me for?
Everyone knows the world is flat!\c"
M90020011,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)That massive island came up from Deep Sky and
now the sky rifts are gone!\e"
M90020012,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I wonder if the sky rifts were formed when the
island sank into Deep Sky in the first place.\c"
M90020013,\h(«Merchant Ship»)I can't believe that island rose from Deep Sky!\e
M90020014,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Think of the impact that it's going to have on
all of the trade routes.\c"
M90200000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)This region is called Mid Ocean. All of the
trade routes pass through here.\e"
M90200001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)That's Sailors' Island, over there. It's in the
middle of all of the trade routes, so it's a
great place to gather information.\c"
M90200002,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Wow! That's an impressive weapon you have there.
Hey, is that a Harpoon Cannon? I've heard those
things can blast through stone reefs!\e"
M90200003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)If you pass through that stone reef, and
continue west, you'll see Nasr. You'll know
you're there when you see a huge desert.\c"
M90200004,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Have you heard? They say that Nasrad, the
capital of Nasr, has been destroyed.\e"
M90200005,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)An Admiral named Ramirez leveled the place. Some
of the merchants are helping the refugees.\c"
M90200006,\h(«Merchant Ship»)They've reopened the route to Cape Victory!\e
M90200007,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Now that engineers are developing engines that
can power through sky rifts, it's even safe to
go to Esparanza now!\e"
M90200008,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)A few advances in technology can really change
the world.\c"
M90200009,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I heard a rumble, then there were some strong
gusts of wind. I was trying to keep control of
my ship, and that island came out of nowhere!\e"
M90200010,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Some merchants see this as an opportunity to
make a profit, but not me! I'm more concerned
with staying alive!\c"
M90200011,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You guys are amazing! You actually defeated the
Valuan Armada! I can't believe it!\e"
M90200012,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)But the Valuans still have a base on that huge
island! I hope you can send that thing back into
Deep Sky where it belongs!\c"
M91200000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Just recently, trade routes have been
established in North Ocean!\e"
M91200001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I heard that Gordo, the Air Pirate, actually
opened a restaurant out there, and I heard
that the food is really good, too!\c"
M91200002,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I'm not about to let that new continent scare me
away! Trade has been better than ever, lately.\e"
M91200003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I know Air Pirates spend all their time going
after treasure, but we have to make an honest
living.\c"
M90210000,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)If you head due north from here, you'll run into
Valua.\e"
M90210001,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Be careful, they won't let you in without a
Valuan Passport. And forget about sneaking
in, there are patrols all over the place.\c"
M90210002,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You guys are pirates, aren't you? If you are,
I'd stay clear of Valua. If they catch you,
you're as good as dead.\e"
M90210003,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Valua has strict laws against piracy. If they
even think you're a pirate, they bring you to
the Coliseum and execute you.\c"
M90210004,\h(«Merchant Ship»)Did you hear what happened in Valua?\e
M90210005,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)There's rumors that someone actually broke out
of the Grand Fortress. I'd like to meet that
guy, and shake his hand.\c"
M90210006,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I've seen a lot of Valuan construction ships in
the area. They must be working on something
pretty big.\c"
M90210007,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)Hey, did you hear? Valua is constructing a new
base. They are building it on Dangral Island.\e"
M90210008,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)None of our ships can fly low enough to get a
good look at it, but there's been lots of
construction ships in the area.\e"
M90210009,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)With that ship of yours, you might be able to
see what's going on. Go south and and start
searching under the clouds. You can't miss it.\c"
M90210010,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)You should be able to see the base, if you fly
south from here and search under the clouds.\c"
M90210011,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)There's been a lot of Valuan ships around here
lately, so we figured that they were up to
something…\e"
M90210012,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)But I never would have guessed that they were
capable of raising an entire continent out of
Deep Sky.\c"
M90210013,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)I can't believe it! You guys were amazing! I
never thought I'd see all of the Air Pirates
join forces and attack the Armada head on.\e"
M90210014,"\h(«Merchant Ship»)By winning that battle, you guys changed the 
course of the world! Who knows what would 
have happened if the Armada had won?\c"
M90050000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Welcome to Nasr, the desert kingdom!\e"
M90050001,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)There's a port called Maramba nearby. Your ship
looks like it's been through quite a bit. Maybe
you should restock your supplies there.\c"
M90050002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)It looks like your ship is from Nasr, but you
don't look Nasrean. I should warn you…\e"
M90050003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)With a ship that small, you would never make it
through the stone reefs that surround our
beautiful desert. You should turn back.\c"
M90050004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)If you go southwest from here, you'll reach
South Ocean, there are some really strong
headwinds there, so be careful.\e"
M90050005,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)It is uncharted territory… no one has ever made
it through South Ocean before, although many
have tried.\c"
M90050006,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Cape Victory? I've heard of it. It's on the
southern tip of Nasr.\e"
M90050007,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)If you want to go there, although I can't
imagine why anyone would go there, you'll have
to fly through a sky rift. Good luck trying…\c"
M90050008,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Items from the newly discovered continent have
already begun to make their way into the
marketplaces of the rest of the world.\e"
M90050009,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Nasrad may have been destroyed, but as long as
there are goods to trade, merchants like us
will survive.\c"
M90050010,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Soltis… Yes, I've heard that name before. It
was the name of an ancient civilization.
Some of our historians have records of it.\e"
M90050011,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)The legends state that the Moons themselves
pushed the entire continent into Deep Sky.\c"
M90060000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Hail, travelers! I am a merchant from the
Kingdom of Nasr.\e"
M90060001,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)My primary trade is in carpets and Red Moon
Stones.\c"
M90060002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)During ship battles, sometimes your gunners will
lose sight of their targets. Any gunner worth
his salt will shout “Lost” when this happens.\e"
M90060003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)This often happens when your opponent gets
behind you in the heat of battle.\c"
M90060004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I heard that the Valuan Armada attacked Nasrad,
and destroyed the city!\e"
M90060005,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I'll bet they burned my shop to the ground, too.
Damn Valuans!\c"
M90060006,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)My shop in Nasrad is gone… destroyed in the
attack. I have no idea what I'm going to do
now…\c"
M90060007,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)First, the Armada leveled Nasrad, now it looks
like they're going to destroy the rest of the
world too.\e"
M90060008,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Please… I know who you are… I've heard of
tales of your bravery… I beg you. Please… stop
them. You're the only one who can.\c"
M91060000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Welcome to Nasrad, the capital of our kingdom!\e"
M91060001,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)We have riches beyond your wildest dreams…
We are truly blessed by the Red Moon.
Enjoy your stay…\c"
M91060002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Your ship is able to fly beneath the clouds, I'm
sure you've seen some amazing things.\e"
M91060003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I bet there're strange creatures and sunken
ships down there, eh?\e"
M90220002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)The Nasr fleet protects our trade routes from
Black Pirates. That's why Nasr is so profitable.
Everyone trades with us, because it's safe.\c"
M90220003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)The capitol of Nasr, may have been
destroyed, but not the spirit of the Nasr
people. They've already started rebuilding.\e"
M90220004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I know that a new city will rise from the ashes
of the old.\c"
M90230000,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)If you keep heading south, you'll run into South
Ocean. Traveling through there is almost
impossible.\e"
M90230001,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)There are some really strong headwinds there…
Most ships can't handle it. It's best to
avoid that area completely.\c"
M90230002,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)What?!
You're really going to try to cross South Ocean?
But, no one has ever crossed it before!!\e"
M90230003,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)What is it with young people these days?
You could get killed! Well, don't say I didn't
warn you.\c"
M90230004,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)What?! You mean to tell me that you crossed
South Ocean and discovered a new continent?\e"
M90230005,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Hmm… If that's true, it might be possible to
start a new trade route through South Ocean.\c"
M90230006,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)We tried to set up a trade route with the new
continent through South Ocean, but the headwinds
were too strong.\e"
M90230007,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Trade routes have opened in North Ocean, but
that doesn't help us here in the South.\c"
M90230008,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I don't know if it has anything to do with the
appearance of that huge island, but the
skies of South Ocean are calm.\e"
M90230009,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)Once the war is over, I may be able to open up
that trade route to the new continent like I've
been wanting to.\e"
M90230010,"\h(«Nasr Merchant Ship»)I'm counting on you, Vyse! It's entirely on your
shoulders! Think of the possibilities! Think of
the money!\c"
M90150000,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I don't think I've ever seen a ship like that
around here before. I'll bet it's a Moon Stone
Trader coming to dig up Yellow Moon Stones.\e"
M90150001,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Just so you know, the Moon Stones in this area
have already been mined, so there's hardly any
left.\e"
M90150002,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Valua is trying to expand because we need to
find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"
M90150003,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Valua is trying to expand because we need to
find new sources of Moon Stones as soon as
possible.\c"
M90150004,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Ah, protecting us from Air Pirates… Good. It's
always nice to see that the Valuan Armada is
looking out for us.\e"
M90150005,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I've heard that there's an Air Pirate named Vyse
who thinks he can outwit the Armada. I hope you
catch him!\c"
M90150006,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)It's shocking news! Lord Galcian has rebelled
against Empress Teodora!\e"
M90150007,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I, I never would have imagined that our glorious
empire would errupt into civil war! I wonder
what Lord Galcian is after…\c"
M90150008,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I couldn't believe my eyes. Moon Stones were
falling on Valua… like rain!\e"
M90150009,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)When the rain stopped, there was nothing left…
Valua has been destroyed.\c"
M90160000,\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)Shhh! Hey kid… I got some Valuan arms here…\e
M90160001,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)I also buy and sell Discovery information.
I've got everything you need…\c"
M90160002,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell ship parts.”
“Buy and sell Discovery information.”
“Leave.”\e"
M90160003,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)Valua discovered Ixa'taka several years ago and
immediately conquered it.\e"
M90160004,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)Today it is a colony of Valua. The people of
Ixa'taka have been put to work as slaves in
order to get Moon Stones.\c"
M90160005,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this
region, and the Ixa'takans don't have a need for
ship parts…\e"
M90160006,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)I really don't know how much longer I'll be able
to stay in business. Maybe it's time to look for
a new line of work…\c"
M90160008,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)You've heard of Domingo, right… He's one of
the greatest explorers of our time.\e"
M90160009,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)If you're hunting for treasure in this area,
good luck. It's not easy finding anything that
Domingo hasn't already discovered.\e"
M90160010,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)Last time I saw him, he said he was searching
for the “Ixa'taka Palace.”\e"
M90160011,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)The Valuan forces have withdrawn from this
region, and the Ixa'takans don't have a need for
ship parts…\e"
M90160012,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)I really don't know how much longer I'll be able
to stay in business. Maybe it's time to look for
a new line of work…\c"
M90160007,"\h(«Black Market Ship Parts Dealer»)I'm always flying around this area, so if you're
ever around, feel free to stop by.\c"
M90280000,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)North Ocean is a vital trade route that brings a
wealth of new goods from the new continent back
to Valua.\e"
M90280001,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Unfortunately, where there's gold to be made,
there's always pirates that want to steal it.
Be careful!\c"
M90280002,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Admirals Belleza and Vigoro took their fleets to
do battle in the west just a little while ago…\e"
M90280003,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Both fleets suffered heavy losses. I wonder what
happened to them?\c"
M90280004,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Just recently, other merchants have begun
trading with the new continent, and Valua's
losing control over the trade routes.\e"
M90280005,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I've also heard that there's dissention in
the Royal Palace, too.\c"
M90280006,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)Our capital has been destroyed. Our glorious
reign of Valuan supremacy appears to be at an
end.\c"
M90290000,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)What do you think of my new ship? Just look at
the shine on this baby! Its new engine is even
capable of punching through sky rifts.\e"
M90290001,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)With ships like this, we'll be able to establish
a trade route running from Maramba to Esparanza!\c"
M90290002,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)The other day when I was flying near the Dark
Rift, I was attacked by a creature the size of
an island.\e"
M90290003,"\h(«Valuan Merchant Ship»)I barely managed to escape with my life… I
couldn't believe how big it was… It was the
scariest thing I've ever seen!\c"
M90070000,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Your ship is very different.
Are you from the West?\e"
M90070001,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)These lands are blessed by the Green Moon.
It is called Ixa'taka.
The forest is our home.\c"
M90070002,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Our people eat berries and seeds. We really like
to eat “Sky Sardis” but they are harder to
catch than berries and seeds.\e"
M90070003,\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Can you please bring me 10 “Sky Sardis?”\c
M90070004,"\h(«Vyse»)If you want “Sky Sardis,” I have 10 right
here! You can have them, if you want.\e"
M90070005,"\h( )You give 10 “Sky Sardis” to the captain of the
ship.\e"
M90070006,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Chomp chomp chomp…
Yum! I love fish!\e"
M90070007,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)I'd eat them every day, but they're too hard to
catch.\e"
M90070008,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Thank you. I am very grateful.
Take this as a symbol of my appreciation.\e"
M90070009,\h( )You received “Abirik Cham” x 1!\c
M90070010,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The “Sky Sardis” were very good.
But, I got a bone stuck in my throat! I guess I
ate them too fast.\c"
M90080000,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Our ships have wings, but they also need
Moon Stones for fuel.\e"
M90080001,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The Valuan ships breathe fire.
We are no match for them.\c"
M90080002,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)A Great Bird spreads its wings… I once heard
this story, a long time ago.\e"
M90080003,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Somewhere near the northern lake, they say
there's a Great Bird that's visible only from
the sky.\c"
M90080004,\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The Valuans left Moon Stone Mountain.\e
M90080005,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The people that were taken hostage returned to
Horteka. I'm so glad that they're all safe.\c"
M90080006,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Many, many Valuan ships came. The ship with the
big firestick blew a hole in the western stone
reef.\e"
M90080007,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)But then, your ship appeared through that hole.
Where did you come from?\c"
M90080008,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)There's a hole at the end of the world. It's big
and scary. I'm going to stay away from it.\e"
M90080009,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The other day, I went near the hole. Another
ship came out. All of the people on it had black
hair. I was scared.\c"
M90240000,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)We've been hiding, but with the Valuans gone,
we can fly our ships again.\e"
M90240001,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)The Valuans left through the iron wall across
the northern valley and flew away. I think you
can get to Valua from there.\c"
M90240002,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)Many Valuan ships came. I was afraid and hid
from them. They flew past me, to the west
of here.\e"
M90240003,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)After a while, the ships came back. There was
lots of smoke on the ships. I wonder what
happened…\c"
M90240004,"\h(«Ixa'takan Ship»)I heard a scary noise coming from the eastern
skies. I wonder what it was…\c"
M90250000,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)I live apart from the rest of the world in this
quiet place, making my home with the flowers
and the insects.\e"
M90250001,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)I'm grateful that you took the trouble to visit
me here, so let me tell you a little secret.\e"
M90250002,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a
wonderful flower called the “Balloon Flower.”
It's very beautiful.\e"
M90250003,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)You will also find a huge flock of insects that
flutter in the wind if you travel to the land
where Ixa'taka meets the Land of the Red Moon.\e"
M90250004,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)… Travel high in the sky to find
“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90250005,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)North of the lands of the Yellow Moon there is a
wonderful flower called the “Balloon Flower.”
It's very beautiful.\e"
M90250006,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)You will also find a huge flock of insects that
flutter in the wind if you travel to the land

M90250007,"\h(«Ixa'takan Hermit»)… Travel high in the sky to find
“Flutterflies.”\c"
M90110000,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)I'm a fisherman. I've been chasing after a fish
called “Hamahai” for a long time.\e"
M90110001,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)This fish called “Hamahai” is a really rare
species that's found only in the skies high
above Yafutoma.\e"
M90110002,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)They fetch a great price, of course. If you have
the time, you might want to see if you can snag
some.\c"
M90120000,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Who are you guys anyway? And how do you manage
to stay in the air with those steel ships of
yours?\e"
M90120001,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)I know who you are! You're Westerners! I've read
about people from the West, but you're the first
Westerners that I've actually seen!\e"
M90120002,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Thanks to Prince Daigo, the Tenkou fleet has now
been recognized as an official part of the
Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120003,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)They don't have to stay in the ranks either.
Because they're Air Pirates, they're better at
guerilla tactics and boarding enemy ships!\c"
M90120004,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Prince Daigo already set sail towards the west
with the rest of the Yafutoman Navy.\e"
M90120005,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)I think Yafutoma is better off with Prince Daigo
as a Naval Commander. It was a mistake to exile
him in the first place.\c"
M90260000,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Mount Kazai is our most impressive landmark. I
doubt any ships from the west would be able to
sail over it.\c"
M90260001,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)What?! You're telling me that your ship can sail
over Mount Kazai?!\e"
M90260002,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Well, I'm really impressed. My compliments
to your engineers.\c"
M90270000,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)Beyond the eastern sky, there is a stone reef. I
found a hole in it, but I've been too scared to
fly close to it.\e"
M90270001,"\h(«Yafutoman Ship»)The other day, I finally got the courage to go
near it, but I saw someone in a strange-looking
ship, wearing a mask, so I flew away.\c"
M90750000,"\h(«Gordo»)There haven't been any fish around here since
that new island came out of Deep Sky.\e"
M90750001,"\h(«Gordo»)Anyone who takes food away from me will pay
dearly. Vyse, I hope you destroy them…\c"
M90750002,"\h(«Gordo»)What was that? 
You're looking for Gentum, Khale, and Kabal?\e"
M90750003,"\h(«Gordo»)I see… well, it looks like you are searching
for some exotic ingredients.\e"
M90750004,"\h(«Gordo»)Fortunately, we serve Kabal here in my
restaurant. I'd be more than happy to give
you some.\e"
M90750005,"\h(«Gordo»)It's always best to marinade it for a day or two
before cooking it… that's when all the flavors
start to come out. Good Kabal is very rare…\e"
M90750006,\h( )You received “Kabal” x 1!\e
M90750007,"\h(«Gordo»)Well then…
You're still looking for the other 2
ingredients, right?\e"
M90750008,"\h(«Gordo»)Hmm… It's a commonly used spice over in Nasr,
and it's easily recognizable by its scent.\e"
M90750009,"\h(«Gordo»)I'd be surprised if you couldn't find any in
Nasrad. After all, it is the largest trade city
in the world.\e"
M90750010,"\h(«Gordo»)And what else were you looking for? Ah yes…
Khale. The “Spice of Dreams” as it is sometimes
called.\e"
M90750011,"\h(«Gordo»)Not only does it spice up food, it actually
enhances the flavor of it as well.\e"
M90750012,"\h(«Gordo»)But, I have heard rumors that the last of the
Khale Trees burned down in the Valua - Nasr
War.\e"
M90750013,"\h(«Gordo»)In the Far East, there is an island that is made
up entirely of spices. If you can find that
island, you may be in luck.\c"
M90750014,"\h(«Gordo»)I think you'll be able to find “Gentum” in
Nasrad.\e"
M90750015,"\h(«Gordo»)If you're looking for “Khale”, there may be some
on Spice Island in the Far East.\c"
M90750016,"\h(«Gordo»)Well, well… I see that the information that I
gave you on Gentum and Khale was helpful.\e"
M90750017,"\h(«Gordo»)If you ever have any more questions concerning
exotic ingredients, I'll be able to help. I'm
not called the Gourmet Pirate for nothing.\c"
M90760000,"\h(«Daigo»)Well, Vyse, this is it. The rest of us will be
watching your back from up here. Go Vyse, you're
the only one that can do this.\c"
M90760001,\h(«Jao»)We pray…\e
M90760002,\h(«Mao»)… for your victory.\c
M90780002,"\h(«Centime»)Vyse, if it is okay, could you take my son,
Hans, with you?\e"
M90780003,"\h(«Centime»)He looks up to you quite a bit. And even though
he's already very skilled at engineering, I
think it would be great training for him.\e"
M90780004,"\h(«Centime»)I think it is time for him to go off on his own
and make his mark in the world.\e"
M90780005,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse, take me with you! I'll do my best to be
of service!\e"
M90780006,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Of course!”
“Sorry, but I can't take you with me.”\e"
M90780007,"\h(«Vyse»)Of course!
I could use another good engineer on my ship!\e"
M90780008,\h(«Hans»)Really? Thank you so much!\e
M90780009,\h( )Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M90780010,"\h(«Vyse»)Sorry, but I can't take you with me.
Doesn't Centime need you to work on his ship?\e"
M90780011,"\h(«Centime»)Don't worry about me, Vyse. I'm quite an
accomplished engineer myself. I've taught him
all that I can.\e"
M90780012,"\h(«Hans»)My father has trained me well! But I know there
is probably much more that I can learn by
working on your ship! Please!\e"
M90780013,"\h(«Vyse»)I see…
Alright, then. I'll take you with me.\e"
M90780014,\h(«Hans»)Thank you so much!\e
M90780015,\h( )Hans has joined your crew as an “Engineer.”\c
M90780000,"\h(«Centime»)Hans… You'll have to pull your own weight on
the Delphinus… And do what Captain Vyse tells
you to do.\e"
M90780001,"\h(«Hans»)Sure, Dad. You've taught me well, and I always
follow orders. I'll do everything I can to help
Captain Vyse.\c"
M90770000,"\h(«Gilder's Vice Captain»)Captain Gilder! You can leave the Claudia with
us! We'll take care of her!\e"
M90770001,"\h(«Willy»)Leave it to us! Wrrack!
Leave it to us!\c"
M90790000,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, Gilder… promise me… promise me that you'll
come back. I'll be waiting right here.\e"
M90790001,"\h(«Clara»)We will always be together. We'll watch the
sunset when you get back. It'll be so romantic.
You're such a dreamboat. My ring size is…\e"
M90790002,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! What am I
saying!? Gilder, we can discuss this later…
Hurry back!\c"
M90790003,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, Gilder… promise me, promise me that you'll
come back to me!\e"
M91160000,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, on the Albatross, you always did your
best. You were always the first to board an
enemy ship, and nobody could stop you.\e"
M91160001,"\h(«Dyne»)I've always been proud of you. Maybe there were
times when I didn't show it, but I've never been
disappointed in you.\e"
M91160002,"\h(«Dyne»)Now, this is it. We've got the enemy cornered.
Don't give up, Vyse! I know you can do it!\c"
M92000000,"\h(«Baltor»)Don't you dare get yourself killed, now, Vyse!
Understand?! I want you to know I won't stand
for it!\e"
M92000001,"\h(«Baltor»)I'll kill you if you die fighting with those
clowns. Got that?! I'm the one who gets to kill
you! Me!\c"
M09902000,"\h(«Aika»)Visibility is horrible!
Vyse, the fog's too thick!
I can barely see!\e"
M09902001,"\h(«Vyse»)That's strange… there's never any fog in this
region… I wonder what's causing it.\e"
M09902002,"\h(«Vyse»)The only way to get to Valua is through here…
Slow to half speed…\e"
M09902003,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, wait… we're too close to that island
over there!\e"
M09903000,"\h(«Dyne»)Hey, you're going the wrong way.
There's nothing but open sky over there.\e"
M09903001,"\h(«Dyne»)Turn around and head back to Pirate Isle. This
is no time for you to be fooling around.\c"
M09903002,"\h(«Aika»)Hey, Vyse! You're heading the wrong way! Did you
forget how to read a compass or something?\e"
M09903003,"\h(«Aika»)Shrine Island is to the southwest of here!
That's when the little needle thingy is between
the “S” and the “W.”\c"
M09903004,"\h(«Aika»)Where are you going? We need to get back home to
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909900,"\h(«Dyne»)This is Shrine Island. Some people say that it's
some kind of ancient temple, others think it's
haunted.\e"
M09909901,"\h(«Dyne»)We don't have time to go sight-seeing. Turn the
ship around and head back to Pirate Isle.\c"
M09904000,"\h(«Valuan Patrol Ship»)Beyond this point is the Valuan Empire. Show me
your entry passport.\e"
M09904001,"\h(«Valuan Patrol Ship»)What?! You don't have a passport?! I cannot
allow you to go beyond this point! Go back to
the pit you crawled out of!\c"
M09904002,"\h(«Valuan Patrol Ship»)Beyond this point is the Valuan Empire. Show me
your entry passport.\e"
M09904003,"\h(«Vyse»)A passport? I've got one right here. Take your
time looking it over.\e"
M09904004,\h(«Valuan Patrol Ship»)… Hmm. Very well.\e
M09904005,\h(«Valuan Patrol Ship»)You may proceed.\c
M09906000,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)We are the Nasr Air Guard! It is our duty to
defend the South Dannel Strait.\e"
M09906001,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)The Southern Dannel Strait is a restricted
area. No unauthorized vessels may pass
through here without express permission.\c"
M09906002,"\h(«Nasr Air Guard»)You cannot enter, no matter how many times you
try. Unauthorized vessels will not be allowed
past this point.\c"
M09908000,"\h(«Drachma»)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908001,"\h(«Drachma»)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully made it
through there.\e"
M09908002,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow…
Sounds like fun. Let's give it a shot.\e"
M09908003,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot! Don't take it so lightly! If it was that
easy, I wouldn't be warnin' you like this!\e"
M09908004,"\h(«Drachma»)Small ships are torn apart by the fierce winds.
Even large ships need considerable power to just
move forward.\e"
M09908005,"\h(«Drachma»)The Little Jack's engine isn't strong enough to
get through here. We must turn back.\c"
M09908006,"\h(«Drachma»)This is South Ocean, boy. I thought I told you
that we'd never make it through there alive.
Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908007,"\h(«Bellena»)The area before you is called South Ocean. I'd
turn back if I were you.\e"
M09908008,"\h(«Bellena»)There's a strong wind that blows from the west
here. This place is known among sailors as one
of the most difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908009,"\h(«Bellena»)Nobody has ever made it through this place. And
nobody knows what lies on the other side,
either.\e"
M09908010,"\h(«Aika»)Wow…
I suppose we'd never make it through in this
tiny ship.\e"
M09908011,"\h(«Bellena»)This ship would probably be torn apart instantly
in the fierce winds.\e"
M09908012,"\h(«Bellena»)We would need a much, much more powerful engine
even to have a chance of making it through
there.\e"
M09908013,"\h(«Aika»)You're probably right. And besides… we should
be looking for the Red Moon Crystal right now,
anyway. Alright Vyse! Turn this ship around!\c"
M09908014,"\h(«Bellena»)I told you that this is South Ocean. We'd never
make it through there. Turn the boat around.\c"
M09908015,"\h(«Drachma»)Listen up, boy. This area is known as South
Ocean. It's considered to be one of the most
difficult places to sail through.\e"
M09908016,"\h(«Drachma»)There's a strong crosswind that blows from the
west. Nobody has ever successfully sailed
through it.\e"
M09908017,"\h(«Vyse»)But the lands of the Green Moon are through
here, right?\e"
M09908018,"\h(«Vyse»)And besides, we have Belleza's engine now.
It's not like we don't have a chance of making
it through.\e"
M09908019,"\h(«Drachma»)Hmm…
Perhaps. But my knowledge of this place is
limited. You're on your own, boy.\e"
M09908020,"\h(«Drachma»)This isn't goin' to be an easy journey. Prepare
yourselves for the worst, kids.\c"
M09909910,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse! This is it! This is where the Red Moon
Crystal is buried!\e"
M09909911,"\h(«Vyse»)Great! Let's land this ship and search the place
right away!\e"
M09909912,\h(«Drachma»)……\e
M09909913,"\h(«Drachma»)… Wait, boy.
Head to town first. I've got some things that I
need to take care of.\e"
M09909914,"\h(«Drachma»)There's a port city named Maramba near here.
Go there first, got it?\e"
M09909915,"\h(«Vyse»)Um… sure. No problem. I just thought that we
could… um… never mind. It doesn't matter to
me.\c"
M09909916,"\h(«Drachma»)You can explore the temple later. Head to
Maramba first, boy.\c"
M09901100,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumph…
So this is the Iron Net. I've heard rumors about
it.\e"
M09901101,"\h(«Drachma»)I heard that the Valuans built this to prevent
people from coming here from North Ocean.\e"
M09901102,"\h(«Drachma»)I guess they didn't want anyone to find out
about this new land.\e"
M09901103,"\h(«Aika»)I hate to say this, but I don't think we're
going to be able to break through that thing.
We should turn back.\c"
M09901104,"\h(«Drachma»)We'll never be able to break through the Iron
Net, boy. Turn this boat around.\c"
M09909920,"\h(«High Priest»)Did you people come from the east?
Then I have nothing to talk to you about.
Go back to where you came from!\c"
M09909930,"\h(«Drachma»)This looks like the Valuan headquarters here
in these parts.\e"
M09909931,"\h(«Drachma»)Who knows what will happen if we just go
wanderin' around in there. We shouldn't get too
close, boy.\c"
M09901400,"\h(«Drachma»)What are you doin', boy?! Are you tryin' to
leave Valua?!\e"
M09901401,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah! Aren't we supposed to be looking for the
Yellow Crystal around here? Turn this boat
around Vyse!\c"
M09901402,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901403,"\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09901500,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey, hey! Where do you think you're going, Vyse?
That's Valuan homeland over there!\e"
M09901501,"\h(«Gilder»)Don't you think we have better things to do
than to pick another fight with the Valuans?
We should probably avoid this area.\c"
M09901502,"\h(«Aika»)Wait a second there, Fina. Isn't that Valua up
ahead?\e"
M09901503,"\h(«Aika»)What are we going to do with this little boat if
the Valuans decide to attack us? We probably
should stay out of there for now.\c"
M09901600,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot!!
Where'dya think you're goin'?! You're headin'
straight out of Valua!\e"
M09901601,"\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam is somewhere around here! I won't let
you ruin my chance to catch him this time!! Turn
this boat around right now!!\c"
M09909940,"\h(«Aika»)Hey! Look over there! There's some kind of
vortex! Maybe we can go inside it!\e"
M09909941,"\h(«Enrique»)Ugh… Per… Perhaps we should head over to…
ugh… Esparanza, first…\e"
M09909942,"\h(«Enrique»)I don't know… how much longer I can take…
this before I… ulp!\e"
M09909943,"\h(«Aika»)Heh… I swear… What are we going to do with
you, Enrique? I suppose we have no choice for
now. Vyse, let's head over to Esparanza!\c"
M09909944,"\h(«Enrique»)Ugh…
Please… can't we just… stop by Esparanza
first? I'm begging you… ulp!\c"
M09909945,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like we can get inside the Dark Rift
through here. Enrique, are you ready?\e"
M09909946,"\h(«Enrique»)… Yes, I'm ready. I don't suppose I have much
of a choice at this point. We must get through
the Dark Rift no matter what.\e"
M09909947,"\h(«Enrique»)Don't mind me… I will be fine. This is neither
the time nor the place to be complaining about
airsickness.\c"
M09902400,"\h(«Gilder»)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09902401,"\h(«Gilder»)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09902402,"\h(«Fina»)Aika… It looks like we've gone a little too far
to the north.\e"
M09902403,"\h(«Aika»)I think you're right.
Who knows what's up ahead. It might be a little
dangerous to go exploring right now.\e"
M09902404,"\h(«Aika»)And from what I can tell of the map, Daccat's
Island probably isn't north of here anyway.
Let's turn around and continue searching.\c"
M09909952,"\h(«Gilder»)I'd stay out of that place, if I were you. There
are all sorts of powerful creatures living in
that area.\e"
M09909953,"\h(«Gilder»)It's not a place that I would take a leisurely
trip through. As much as I like a good thrill,
I think we should probably turn around.\c"
M09909950,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse… do not return to Crescent Isle. I beg of
you.\e"
M09909951,"\h(«Enrique»)If I go back now… I… I'm afraid that my
determination will falter. I cannot allow myself
to do that…\c"
M09909960,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this?
There's something set into the statue's eye
socket…\e"
M09909961,\h( )You found the “Golden Man's Eye.”\e
M09909962,"\h(«Aika»)Hey, no one will notice if it's missing, right?
And besides… we're Air Pirates!! Can you really
blame us for taking a little bit of treasure?\c"
M09909963,"\h(«Vyse»)Hm? Hey, Aika… do you see something glittering
on the ground? Right where the eye of that bird
would be…\e"
M09909964,"\h(«Aika»)Hey, you're right! Let me go down and see what
it is…\e"
M09909965,"\h(«Aika»)… Hey, Vyse! I found something! There was a gem
stuck into the ground! I'm sure they won't miss
a little, itty-bitty gem, would they?\e"
M09909966,\h( )You found the “Great Bird's Eye.”\e
M09909967,"\h(«Aika»)Besides, who knows when a nice little gem like
this will come in handy?\c"
M09909968,"\h(«Fina»)I…
I can't believe that they actually used the
Rains of Destruction…\e"
M09909969,\h(«Aika»)Fina…\e
M09909970,"\h(«Gilder»)… Vyse, maybe we should head back to Crescent
Isle and take a minute to regroup. We can't do
anything to get into Soltis right now, anyway.\e"
M09909971,"\h(«Vyse»)… You're right.
I really hate to do this, but it looks like we
have no choice but to just head home for now.\c"
M09909972,"\h(«Vyse»)There's an incredibly strong wind blowing from
inside the Dark Rift.\e"
M09909973,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like it's going to be tough to get
through there even with the Delphinus…\c"
M09909974,"\h(«Vyse»)Hm… It looks like we've come out of the Dark
Rift on the same side that we went in on.\c"
M09909975,"\h(«Aika»)On the treasure map it says, “The dead will
always watch over my treasure.”\e"
M09909976,"\h(«Aika»)And there's a skull here on the eastern part of
the Valuan continent. I wonder if that has to
do with anything…\c"
M09909977,"\h(«Vyse»)… What's this place? Why are there buildings
being built on an island way down here?!\c"
M09909994,"\h(«Vyse»)It's too dangerous to go back there right now.
And, besides… I shouldn't let Gregorio's
sacrifice be in vain.\c"
M09909995,"\h(«Aika»)This is the Armada's homebase. We probably
shouldn't get too close, or we'll be asking for
trouble. Let's just turn the ship around…\c"
M09909978,"\h(«Aika»)We did it!!
We actually made it through the Dark Rift!!\e"
M09909979,"\h(«Enrique»)Well! I can't believe that we are actually going
to be able to see what lies east of the Dark
Rift! We're making history as we speak!\c"
M09909980,"\h(«Aika»)Wow! There are so many herbs and spices growing
here! I've never seen so many in one place
before!\e"
M09909981,"\h(«Vyse»)It's amazing… This place truly is a treasure
island.\e"
M09909982,"\h(«Fina»)But we really shouldn't disturb the island too
much…\e"
M09909983,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah… I suppose that if we took too many of the
seeds and stuff that the trees might not be able
to grow back.\e"
M09909984,"\h(«Aika»)… But, I'm sure it would be okay just to take a
little bit, right Vyse?\e"
M09909985,"\h(«Vyse»)I swear, Aika. You and your “just a little bit.”
Alright, alright… we'll take something with us.\e"
M09909986,\h( )You received the spice “Khale.”\e
M09909987,"\h(«Drachma»)King Ixa'taka spoke of an Iron Net to the north
of this continent.\e"
M09909988,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah… But, if the Valuans escaped to the north,
that means they probably had to take down the
Iron Net, right?\e"
M09909989,"\h(«Drachma»)That means we'll be able to reach North Ocean
that way. We'll head straight to Valua from
there.\c"
M09909990,"\h(«Enrique»)In truth, the Delphinus has not yet been
completed.\e"
M09909991,"\h(«Enrique»)The hull hasn't been fully reinforced yet, so it
would probably be impossible to fly through
stone reefs at this point.\e"
M09909992,"\h(«Enrique»)And the engine's output settings haven't been
properly adjusted yet either, so we probably
won't be able fly through sky rifts.\e"
M09909993,"\h(«Enrique»)However, if we can find some way to fix the hull
and the engine, I'm sure sky rifts and stone
reefs would pose no problem for this ship.\e"
M09909000,\h(«Dyne»)Wait… that's the legendary “Pirate's Grave!”\e
M09909001,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Good job, Vyse! I'm sure that the Sailors' Guild
would be more than happy to pay you for making
this Discovery!\e"
M09909002,"\h(«Vyse»)Guild?
Pay me for a Discovery?\e"
M09909003,"\h(«Dyne»)Much of this world is uncharted and shrouded
in legend. Ruins, strange creatures… all
sorts of things are waiting to be discovered.\e"
M09909004,"\h(«Dyne»)Any major port city will have a Sailors' Guild.
They pay explorers well for any information on
Discoveries that they've made.\e"
M09909005,"\h(«Dyne»)When you're flying through the skies and your
compass starts spinning around rapidly, that
means there's a Discovery nearby.\e"
M09909006,"\h(«Dyne»)If you try searching the area, you'll probably
find a Discovery. Just head over to the Sailors'
Guild afterwards and collect your reward.\e"
M09909007,"\h(«Dyne»)But, the longer you wait, the greater the chance
that someone else will beat you to it. So, you
should visit the Guild as soon as you can, okay?\c"
M09909008,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, before we set sail, do you have any
questions that you wanted to ask me?\e"
M09909009,"\h(«What will you say?»)“How do I steer this thing?”
“How do we get home from here?”
“No, not really.”\e"
M09909010,"\h(«Vyse»)Just to be safe, how exactly do I steer this
thing?\e"
M09909011,"\h(«Dyne»)I never thought I'd hear you ask something like
that. Heh… Nevertheless, pay close attention.\e"
M09909012,"\h(«Dyne»)Using the analog stick, you can move forward or
backward, and turn left or right.\e"
M09909013,"\h(«Dyne»)You can control your altitude by using the R and
L triggers. The R trigger will move the ship
upward and the L trigger will do the opposite.\e"
M09909014,"\h(«Dyne»)Whenever you want to search anything or whenever
you want to dock at a harbor, just press the
A button.\e"
M09909015,"\h(«Vyse»)Um… don't laugh at me, Dad… er… Captain, but
I don't remember the way home from here. Could
you tell me where to go?\e"
M09909016,"\h(«Dyne»)How do you expect to become a good sailor if you
don't pay attention to where you are?! Just head
southeast from here.\e"
M09909017,"\h(«Dyne»)You'll recognize the island when you see it…
hopefully. If you get lost, you can look at a
map using the Start button.\e"
M09909018,"\h(«Dyne»)Also, you'll run into monsters on occasion as
you're sailing. If you do, run out to the deck
and take 'em out.\e"
M09909019,"\h(«Dyne»)One word of warning: there are these monsters
called Maroccas that live around here. They're
pretty tough.\e"
M09909020,"\h(«Dyne»)If you're not doing much damage on your enemy,
try hitting the Y button to change the
properties of your weapon. It might work better.\c"
M09909021,"\h(«Dyne»)Well, then! Full speed ahead! Destination,
Pirate Isle!\c"
M09909022,"\h(«Drachma»)That reminds me… you should have received
something called a “Captain's Stripe.”\e"
M09909023,"\h(«Drachma»)You'll receive one for every major battle that
you win. It's sort of like a trophy.\e"
M09909024,"\h(«Drachma»)If you “Use” a Captain's Stripe, it will make
your ship stronger.\e"
M09909025,"\h(«Vyse»)I see. Thanks for the advice, Captain.\c"
M09909026,"\h(«Drachma»)It looks like we picked up a “Magic Cannon” from
the lady admiral.\e"
M09909027,"\h(«Drachma»)Using this, we'll be able to fire cannonballs
charged with magical energy.\e"
M09909028,"\h(«Aika»)Just like Belleza was doing, right? That's
great! Vyse! Did you hear that?! We should
really put this thing to good use!\e"
M09909029,"\h(«Drachma»)Be careful though, boy. Using the Magic Cannon
uses up MP just like normal magic. So don't go
too crazy with it.\c"

te acercas lo suficientemente, puedes oírlos
de noche si no sopla el viento.\c"
MS90010004,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)¡Era increíble! Primero se oyó un ruido
estrepitoso y mi navío empezó a moverse.
Miré por la borda……\e"
MS90010005,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)……y vi una flota entera de acorazados Valuan.
No sé adónde se dirigían, pero eran tantos
navíos que yo diría que iban a atacar.\c"
MS90010006,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Si buscas Isla Los Marinos,
está al noreste de aquí.

MS90010007,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Lo verás justo después de atravesar el túnel de
piedra.\c"
MS90010008,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Por lo que he oído, Valua cuenta con un nuevo
Almirante en sus filas. Con eso la Armada
ya cuenta con seis flotas principales.\e"
MS90010009,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Con todos esos navíos, deben estar tramando
algo. Yo no me metería con ellos por si acaso.\c"
MS90010010,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)¡¿Pero de dónde has sacado ese navío?!
¡No he visto nada semejante en mi vida!\e"
MS90010011,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Un momento…… ¡Ese navío es Valuan! ¡¡¡Lo habéis
robado!!! O sois increíblemente valerosos……
¡o increíblemente tontos!\c"
MS90010012,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)¿Es eso cierto?
¿Es verdad que existe un país
llamado Yafutoma en el Este?\e"
MS90010013,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)¡¿Cómo?! ¿También se llega a Yafutoma en
dirección oeste? Pero…… no lo entiendo……\c"
MS90010014,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)No lo puedo creer…… Valua ha sido arrasada
totalmente. Si el viento sopla a favor, se puede
oler el humo a 100 kilómetros.\c"
MS90020000,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Entonces vosotros debéis ser miembros del
tristemente famoso clan Dyne.
¡Últimamente no se habla de otra cosa!\e"
MS90020001,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Por lo visto habéis estado armando jaleo
en Valua. Seguid así.
Desde aquí os brindamos todo nuestro apoyo.\c"

en la Isla del Templo.\e"
MS90020003,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Puedes olvidarte de esa piedra.

un pasaporte para entrar.\e"
MS90020005,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Normalmente, los pasaportes se entregan
a un número muy reducido de mercaderes

MS90200001,"\h(«Navío Mercante»)Ésa de allí es Isla Los Marinos. Está de

¡Piensa en las tremendas posibilidades!
¡Piensa en las ganancias!\c"
MS90150000,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Nunca había visto nunca un navío como ése
por aquí. Seguro que es de un comerciante de
Piedras Lunares en busca de Piedras Amarillas.\e"
MS90150001,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Para tu información, todas las Piedras
Amarillas de esta zona han sido explotadas ya,
así que no queda prácticamente ninguna.\e"
MS90150002,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Valua intenta expandirse porque se necesitan
nuevas fuentes de Piedras Lunares
lo antes posible.\c"

MS90150004,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Protegernos de los Piratas Aéreos…… Muy bien.
Está bien saber que la Armada Valuan vela por
nuestra seguridad.\e"
MS90150005,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)He oído que hay un Pirata Aéreo, un tal Vyse,
que cree que puede engañar a la Armada.
¡Espero que lo capturéis!\c"
MS90150006,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)¡Qué noticia tan increíble! ¡Lord Galcian se ha
rebelado contra la Emperatriz Teodora!\e"
MS90150007,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)¡Nunca me habría imaginado que nuestro glorioso
Imperio terminaría en una guerra civil!
No sé qué razones mueven a Lord Galcian……\c"
MS90150008,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)No podía creer lo que estaba viendo.
Caían Piedras Lunares sobre Valua……
¡Parecía lluvia!\e"
MS90150009,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Cuando la lluvia cesó, no quedaba nada……
Valua había sido devastada.\c"
MS90160000,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)¡Eh, muchacho……!
Tengo algunas armas Valuan aquí……\e"
MS90160001,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)También compro y vendo información sobre
Descubrimientos.
Tengo todo lo que necesites……\c"
MS90160002,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Comprar y vender Repuestos de Navío.”
“Comprar y vender Datos de Descubrimientos.”
“Salir.”\e"
MS90160003,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)Valua descubrió Ixa'taka hace muchos años
e inmediatamente se lanzó a conquistarla.\e"
MS90160004,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)Ahora es una colonia de Valua.
Las gentes de Ixa'taka trabajan como esclavos
para extraer Piedras Lunares de la tierra.\c"
MS90160005,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)El Ejército Valuan se ha retirado de la zona y
entre los Ixa'takan no hay demasiada demanda
de repuestos de navío……\e"
MS90160006,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)La verdad es que no sé por cuánto tiempo
voy a poder seguir con este negocio.
Voy a tener que cambiar de profesión……\c"
MS90160008,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)Supongo que sabes quién es Domingo…… Es uno de
los grandes exploradores de nuestro tiempo.\e"
MS90160009,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)Si quieres es encontrar tesoros por esta
zona, que tengas suerte. No es fácil encontrar
algo que Domingo no haya descubierto ya.\e"
MS90160010,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)La última vez que le vi, dijo que estaba
buscando el “Palacio Ixa'taka”.\e"

entre los Ixa'takan no hay demasiada demanda

MS90160007,"\h(«Vendedor de Repuestos del Mercado Negro»)Siempre estoy volando por esta zona, así que si
quieres hacerme una visita cualquier día que
pases por aquí, ya sabes.\c"
MS90280000,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)La del Océano Norte es una ruta comercial muy
importante que sirve para traer a Valua muchas
mercancías del nuevo continente.\e"
MS90280001,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Por desgracia, cuando hay oro de por medio
siempre hay piratas al acecho intentando
robarlo. ¡Mucho cuidado!\c"
MS90280002,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Los Almirantes Belleza y Vigoro emprendieron
el camino hacia el Oeste con sus flotas
de acorazados hace sólo un momento……\e"
MS90280003,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Ambas flotas sufrieron muchas pérdidas.
¿Qué les habrá pasado?\c"
MS90280004,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Mercaderes de otros lugares han empezado a
comerciar con el nuevo continente y Valua está
perdiendo su dominio de las rutas comerciales.\e"
MS90280005,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)También he oído que había tensiones en el
Palacio Real.\c"
MS90280006,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Nuestra capital ha sido destruida. La supremacía
del glorioso reinado Valuan parece haber llegado
a su fin.\c"
MS90290000,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)¿Qué te parece mi navío nuevo? ¡Mira cómo brilla
esta hermosura! Su nuevo motor tiene capacidad
para atravesar las grietas celestes.\e"
MS90290001,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)¡Con navíos como éste, podremos establecer una
ruta comercial que vaya de Maramba a
Esperanza!\c"
MS90290002,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)El otro día estaba volando junto a la Gruta
Oscura, y de repente un ser del tamaño de una
isla entera me atacó.\e"
MS90290003,"\h(«Navío Mercante Valuan»)Fue un milagro que saliera con vida……
No podía creer lo grande que era……
¡Nunca había visto nada tan espantoso!\c"
MS90070000,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Tienes un navío un poco raro.
¿Vienes del Oeste?\e"
MS90070001,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Estas tierras están bajo la protección
de la Luna Verde. Se llaman Ixa'taka.
El bosque es nuestro hogar.\c"
MS90070002,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Nuestra gentes comen semillas y frutos. Nos
encantan las “Sardis Celestes”, pero son más
difíciles de coger que las semillas y frutos.\e"
MS90070003,\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)¿Me podrías traer 10 “Sardis Celestes”?\c
MS90070004,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Si quieres “Sardis Celestes”, tengo 10 aquí
mismo! Puedes quedártelas si quieres.\e"
MS90070005,"\h( )Le has dado 10 “Sardis Celestes” al capitán
del navío.\e"
MS90070006,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Chomp chomp chomp……
¡Mmmm! ¡Me encanta el pescado!\e"
MS90070007,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)No me importaría comer pescado todos los días,
pero es muy difícil de atrapar.\e"
MS90070008,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Gracias. Muchas gracias.
Toma esto como muestra de mi agradecimiento.\e"
MS90070009,\h( )｡Has recibido “Chum Abirik” x 1!\c
MS90070010,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Esas “Sardis Celestes” estaban riquísimas.
¡Pero se me ha clavado una espina en la
garganta! Me las he comido muy deprisa.\c"
MS90080000,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Aunque nuestros navíos tengan alas, también
necesitan Piedras Lunares como combustible.\e"
MS90080001,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Los navíos Valuan escupen fuego.
No podemos medirnos con ellos.\c"
MS90080002,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Un Gran Pájaro extiende las alas……
Esta historia me la contaron una vez,
pero hace mucho tiempo.\e"
MS90080003,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)En algún lugar, junto al lago del norte,
dicen que hay un Gran Pájaro que sólo
es visible desde el cielo.\c"
MS90080004,\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Los Valuan se fueron del Monte Lunar.\e
MS90080005,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Todos los prisioneros regresaron a Horteka.
¡Qué bien que ya estén todos a salvo!\c"
MS90080006,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Vinieron muchos navíos Valuan.
El que tenía el gran cañón que escupía fuego
hizo un agujero en el arrecife del oeste.\e"
MS90080007,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Y luego tu navío llego aquí a través
de ese agujero.
¿De dónde vienes?\c"
MS90080008,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)En el fin del mundo, hay un agujero. Es muy
grande y siniestro. No quiero acercarme.\e"
MS90080009,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)El otro día, me acerqué al agujero y otro navío
salía de él. Toda la tripulación tenía
el pelo negro. ¡Pasé un miedo!\c"
MS90240000,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Hemos estado ocultándonos, pero ahora
que los Valuan se han ido, podemos volar
en nuestros navíos de nuevo.\e"
MS90240001,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Los Valuan atravesaron el valle de la muralla
de acero que hay en el norte y desaparecieron.
Por ahí se llegará a Valua.\c"
MS90240002,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Vinieron muchos navíos Valuan.
Yo tenía mucho miedo y me escondí.
Pasaron de largo y siguieron hacia el Oeste.\e"
MS90240003,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Al cabo de un rato volvieron esos navíos.
Había mucho humo en ellos.
No sé qué podía estar pasando……\c"
MS90240004,"\h(«Navío Ixa'takan»)Oí un ruido ensordecedor procedente del cielo
del este. No sé qué era……\c"
MS90250000,"\h(«Ermitaño Ixa'takan»)Vivo en este apacible lugar, apartado del mundo,
donde me he construido un hogar junto a las
flores y los insectos.\e"
MS90250001,"\h(«Ermitaño Ixa'takan»)Como os agradezco mucho que os hayáis
tomado la molestia de venir hasta aquí,
os voy a contar un secreto.\e"
MS90250002,"\h(«Ermitaño Ixa'takan»)Al norte de las tierras de la Luna Amarilla
crece una maravillosa flor llamada “Flor Globo”.
Es de una gran belleza.\e"
MS90250003,"\h(«Ermitaño Ixa'takan»)Y si viajáis a las tierras que confluyen
entre Ixa'takan y el continente de
la Luna Roja, encontraréis muchos insectos.\e"
MS90250004,"\h(«Ermitaño Ixa'takan»)……Volad a gran altitud
y encontraréis “Flutterflies”.\c"
MS90250005,"\h(«Ermitaño Ixa'takan»)Al norte de las tierras de la Luna Amarilla

MS90110000,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)Soy pescador y llevo mucho tiempo intentando
atrapar un pez llamado “Hamahai”.\e"
MS90110001,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)Este pez, el “Hamahai”, pertenece a una
especie muy rara que sólo se encuentra
a gran altitud en los cielos de Yafutoma.\e"
MS90110002,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)Tienen un precio muy alto en el mercado.
Si tienes tiempo, a lo mejor te interesa
intentar pescar uno.\c"
MS90120000,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)¿Pero quiénes sois vosotros?
¿Y cómo podéis volar con esos navíos de acero?\e"
MS90120001,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)¡Ya sé quiénes sois! ¡Venís del Oeste!
¡He leído cosas sobre la gente del Oeste,
pero vosotros sois los primeros que conozco!\e"
MS90120002,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)Gracias al Príncipe Daigo, la flota Tenkou
ha sido reconocida oficialmente como parte
de la Armada Yafutoman.\e"
MS90120003,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)No tienen que estar en primera línea de combate.
¡Como buenos Piratas Aéreos, son expertos en
tácticas de guerrilla, como ir al abordaje!\c"
MS90120004,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)El Príncipe Daigo ya ha zarpado hacia el Oeste
con el resto de la Armada Yafutoman.\e"
MS90120005,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)Creo que es mejor para Yafutoma que el
Príncipe Daigo sea Comandante de la Armada.
Fue un gran error que le mandaran al exilio.\c"
MS90260000,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)El Monte Kazai es nuestro paisaje más
impactante. Dudo mucho que ningún navío
del Oeste pueda navegar sobre él.\c"
MS90260001,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)¡¿Qué?! ¡¿Dices que tu navío puede navegar
sobre el Monte Kazai?!\e"
MS90260002,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)Caray, me dejas de una pieza. Felicita a tus
ingenieros de mi parte.\c"
MS90270000,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)Más allá del cielo del Este, hay un arrecife.
Allí había un agujero, pero yo siempre
he temido acercarme.\e"
MS90270001,"\h(«Navío Yafutoman»)El otro día, saqué fuerzas de flaqueza y me
acerqué, pero vi a alguien con una máscara que
iba en un navío muy raro, así que huí.\c"
MS90750000,"\h(«Gordo»)Desde que esa isla salió del Cielo Profundo,
han desaparecido todos los peces de esta zona.\e"
MS90750001,"\h(«Gordo»)Todos aquellos que osen robarme
algo de comida, lo pagarán caro.
Vyse, espero que acabes con ellos……\c"
MS90750002,"\h(«Gordo»)¿Cómo dices?
¿Que andas buscando Gentum, Khale y Kabal?\e"
MS90750003,"\h(«Gordo»)Ya…… bueno, parece que estás buscando
ingredientes exóticos.\e"
MS90750004,"\h(«Gordo»)Por suerte, aquí en mi restaurante servimos
Kabal. Sería un honor para mí darte un poco.\e"
MS90750005,"\h(«Gordo»)Es mejor dejarlo marinar uno o dos días antes de
cocinarlo…… para que tenga más sabor.
El buen Kabal es difícil de encontrar……\e"
MS90750006,\h( )｡Has recibido “Kabal” x 1!\e
MS90750007,"\h(«Gordo»)Entonces……
Aún te queda encontrar los otros 2 ingredientes,
¿no?\e"
MS90750008,"\h(«Gordo»)Es una especia que se usa en Nasr, fácil de
distinguir por su aroma.\e"
MS90750009,"\h(«Gordo»)Me sorprendería que no lo pudieras encontrar
en Nasrad. Al fin y al cabo, es la ciudad
comercial más grande del mundo.\e"
MS90750010,"\h(«Gordo»)¿Y qué era lo otro? Ah, sí…… Khale.
La “Especia de los Sueños”
como se le suele llamar.\e"
MS90750011,"\h(«Gordo»)No sólo añade un sabor picante, además
potencia el sabor original del alimento.\e"
MS90750012,"\h(«Gordo»)Pero he oído que los últimos árboles de Khale
que quedaban se quemaron en la guerra
entre Valua y Nasr.\e"
MS90750013,"\h(«Gordo»)En el Lejano Oriente, hay una isla que está
compuesta por especias. Si encuentras
esa isla, vas a estar de suerte.\c"
MS90750014,\h(«Gordo»)Creo que en Nasrad podrás encontrar “Gentum”.\e
MS90750015,"\h(«Gordo»)Si lo que buscas es “Khale”, debe haber algo
en la Isla de Especias que encontrarás
en el Oriente Lejano.\c"
MS90750016,"\h(«Gordo»)Bueno, bueno…… Veo que la información
que te di sobre el Gentum y el Khale
te ha sido de gran utilidad.\e"
MS90750017,"\h(«Gordo»)Siempre que tengas cualquier duda sobre
ingredientes exóticos, yo te puedo ayudar.
Por algo me llaman el Pirata Gourmet.\c"
MS90760000,"\h(«Daigo»)Bueno, Vyse, ha llegado la hora. Te estaremos
observando desde aquí. Tú eres el único que
puede hacerlo.\c"

MS90760002,\h(«Mao»)…… y por tu victoria.\c
MS90780002,"\h(«Centime»)Vyse, ¿te importaría llevar a mi hijo Hans
contigo en el navío?\e"

los conocimientos de un experto mecánico,
le vendría muy bien practicar.\e"

vida y busque su lugar en el mundo.\e"

MS90780008,\h(«Hans»)¿En serio? ¡Muchas gracias!\e
MS90780009,"\h( )Hans se ha unido a la tripulación como
“Técnico”.\c"
MS90780010,"\h(«Vyse»)Lo siento, pero no puedes venir conmigo.
¿Es que Centime no te necesita en su navío?\e"
MS90780011,"\h(«Centime»)No te preocupes por mí, Vyse.
Soy un buen mecánico y, además,
le he enseñado todo lo que sé.\e"
MS90780012,"\h(«Hans»)¡Mi padre me lo ha enseñado todo! ¡Pero sé que
trabajando en tu navío voy a aprender todavía
más! ¡Por favor!\e"
MS90780013,"\h(«Vyse»)Ya……
Entonces, está bien. Puedes venir conmigo.\e"
MS90780014,\h(«Hans»)¡Muchas gracias!\e

¡Promete que volverás pronto!\e"
MS91160000,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, en el Albatross siempre has dado
lo mejor de ti mismo. Eras siempre el primero
en abordar y no había quien te parara.\e"
MS91160001,"\h(«Dyne»)Siempre he estado orgulloso de ti.
Aunque no siempre lo mostraba abiertamente,
la verdad es que nunca me has decepcionado.\e"
MS91160002,"\h(«Dyne»)Por fin ha llegado el gran momento.
Tenemos al enemigo acorralado.
¡No abandones, Vyse! ¡Puedes hacerlo!\c"

MS09902000,"\h(«Aika»)¡La visibilidad es horrible!
¡Vyse, la niebla es demasiado densa!

MS09902001,"\h(«Vyse»)Qué raro…… nunca hay niebla en esta región……
No sé cuál puede ser la causa.\e"

Reduce la velocidad……\e"
MS09902003,"\h(«Aika»)Espera, Vyse……
¡Nos estamos acercando demasiado a esa isla!\e"
MS09903000,"\h(«Dyne»)Vais por el camino equivocado.
Ahí no hay nada más que cielo abierto.\e"
MS09903001,"\h(«Dyne»)Dad la vuelta hacia la Isla del Pirata.
No es momento para perder tiempo con bobadas.\c"
MS09903002,"\h(«Aika»)¡Eh, Vyse! ¡Vas en dirección equivocada!
¿Se te ha olvidado cómo se lee la brújula
o qué?\e"
MS09903003,"\h(«Aika»)¡La Isla del Templo está al sudoeste de aquí!
¿Y cómo se sabe? Cuando la pequeña aguja
de la brújula está entre la “S” y la “W”.\c"
MS09903004,"\h(«Aika»)¿Adónde vais? ¡Tenemos que volver a casa, a la
Isla del Pirata!\c"
MS09909900,"\h(«Dyne»)Ésta el la Isla del Templo.
Hay quien dice que es un antiguo templo,
otros que está encantada.\e"
MS09909901,"\h(«Dyne»)No hay tiempo para excursiones turísticas.
Da la vuelta y dirígete a la Isla del Pirata.\c"
MS09904000,"\h(«Patrulla Valuan»)Vais a entrar en territorio del Imperio Valuan.
Necesito ver el pasaporte de entrada.\e"
MS09904001,"\h(«Patrulla Valuan»)¡¿Qué?! ¡¿No tenéis pasaporte?!
¡No puedo dejaros pasar!
¡Volved al agujero del que habéis salido!\c"

MS09904003,"\h(«Vyse»)¿El pasaporte? Sí, lo tengo aquí mismo.
Tómate tu tiempo para inspeccionarlo.\e"
MS09904004,\h(«Patrulla Valuan»)…… Mmm. Muy bien.\e
MS09904005,\h(«Patrulla Valuan»)Podéis pasar.\c
MS09906000,"\h(«Guardián Aéreo de Nasr»)¡Somos la Guardia Aérea de Nasr! Nuestro deber
es defender el Estrecho de Dannel Sur.\e"
MS09906001,"\h(«Guardián Aéreo de Nasr»)El Estrecho de Dannel Sur es una zona
restringida. Ningún navío sin autorización
previa puede pasar por aquí.\c"
MS09906002,"\h(«Guardián Aéreo de Nasr»)No se puede pasar, me da igual lo que me
contéis. Ningún navío sin la debida autorización
puede pasar de aquí.\c"
MS09908000,"\h(«Drachma»)Escúchame, muchacho. A esta zona se la conoce
como el Océano Sur y se considera uno de los
lugares más difíciles de transitar del mundo.\e"
MS09908001,"\h(«Drachma»)Hay una conjunción de vientos muy fuerte
procedente del Oeste. Nadie ha conseguido
pasar por allí jamás.\e"
MS09908002,"\h(«Vyse»)Caramba……
Suena fascinante. Tenemos que intentarlo.\e"
MS09908003,"\h(«Drachma»)¡Necio! ¡No te lo tomes a la ligera!
¡Si fuera tan fácil,
no te lo estaría advirtiendo!\e"
MS09908004,"\h(«Drachma»)La fuerza del viento parte los navíos por la
mitad. Hasta los navíos grandes necesitan una
enorme potencia sólo para avanzar lentamente.\e"
MS09908005,"\h(«Drachma»)El motor del Little Jack no tiene
la suficiente potencia para pasar por ahí.
Tenemos que dar la vuelta.\c"
MS09908006,"\h(«Drachma»)Esto es el Océano Sur, muchacho. Ya te lo he
dicho, no conseguiremos atravesarlo con vida.
¡Da marcha atrás!\c"
MS09908007,"\h(«Bellena»)La zona que hay ante nosotros es el Océano Sur.
Si yo fuera tú, daría la vuelta.\e"
MS09908008,"\h(«Bellena»)Hay un viento muy fuerte que sopla desde el
Oeste. Por eso el lugar tiene fama entre los
marinos por lo difícil que es navegar aquí.\e"
MS09908009,"\h(«Bellena»)Nadie ha conseguido cruzarlo.
Y nadie sabe lo que hay al otro lado.\e"
MS09908010,"\h(«Aika»)Caray……
Supongo no seremos nosotros los que
lo crucemos con este navío tan pequeño.\e"
MS09908011,"\h(«Bellena»)Los terribles vendavales destrozarían este navío
casi instantáneamente.\e"
MS09908012,"\h(«Bellena»)Para tener tan sólo la posibilidad de cruzar,
necesitaríamos un motor mucho, mucho más potente
que el nuestro.\e"
MS09908013,"\h(«Aika»)Tienes toda la razón. Además…… lo que deberíamos
hacer es buscar el Cristal Rojo.
¡Bueno, Vyse! ¡Da la vuelta inmediatamente!\c"
MS09908014,"\h(«Bellena»)Ya te lo he dicho, es el Océano Sur.
No vamos a seguir adelante.
Da la vuelta al navío.\c"

MS09908016,"\h(«Drachma»)Hay una conjunción de vientos muy fuerte
procedente del Oeste. Nadie ha conseguido
pasar por allí jamás.\e"
MS09908017,"\h(«Vyse»)Pero aquí es donde están las tierras
de la Luna Verde, ¿no?\e"
MS09908018,"\h(«Vyse»)Además, ahora disponemos del motor de Belleza.
Yo no podemos decir que no tenemos ninguna
posibilidad de conseguirlo.\e"
MS09908019,"\h(«Drachma»)Mmm…… Es posible.
Pero mis conocimientos de este lugar son
limitados. Estás tú solo en esto, muchacho.\e"
MS09908020,"\h(«Drachma»)Esta vez no va a ser nada fácil.
Tenemos que prepararnos para lo peor,
muchachos.\c"
MS09909910,"\h(«Fina»)¡Vyse! ¡Está aquí! ¡Aquí está enterrado el
Cristal Rojo!\e"
MS09909911,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Genial! ¡Vamos a aterrizar el navío e
inspeccionar este sitio enseguida!\e"
MS09909912,\h(«Drachma»)……\e
MS09909913,"\h(«Drachma»)…… No tan deprisa, muchacho.
Primero vamos a la ciudad. Tengo unos asuntos
pendientes de los que ocuparme.\e"
MS09909914,"\h(«Drachma»)Cerca de aquí hay una ciudad portuaria llamada
Maramba. Es mejor que vayas antes allí.
¿De acuerdo?\e"
MS09909915,"\h(«Vyse»)Mm…… claro. No pasa nada. Es que pensaba que a
lo mejor…… da igual. Me da exactamente lo
mismo.\c"
MS09909916,"\h(«Drachma»)Puedes explorar el templo más tarde.
Primero ve a Maramba, muchacho.\c"
MS09901100,"\h(«Drachma»)Mmmmff……
Así que ésta es la Cortina de Acero.
Ya había oído hablar de ella.\e"
MS09901101,"\h(«Drachma»)He oído que los Valuan la construyeron
para evitar que se pudiera llegar aquí
desde el Océano Norte.\e"
MS09901102,"\h(«Drachma»)Supongo que no querían que nadie descubriera las
nuevas tierras.\e"
MS09901103,"\h(«Aika»)Odio tener que decirlo, pero creo
que no vamos a poder atravesar eso.
Deberíamos dar la vuelta.\c"
MS09901104,"\h(«Drachma»)Nunca podremos atravesar la Cortina de Acero,
muchacho. Da la vuelta.\c"
MS09909920,"\h(«Alto Sacerdote»)¿Venís del Este, forasteros?
Entonces no tengo nada que deciros.
¡Volved por donde habéis venido!\c"
MS09909930,"\h(«Drachma»)Me da la impresión de que la sede principal
de los Valuan está por aquí.\e"
MS09909931,"\h(«Drachma»)Quién sabe qué puede pasar
si nos damos una vuelta por ahí.
No creo que sea buena idea acercarse mucho.\c"
MS09901400,"\h(«Drachma»)¿Qué haces, muchacho?
¿Es que quieres irte de Valua?\e"
MS09901401,"\h(«Aika»)¡Sí! ¿No habíamos venido a buscar el Cristal
Amarillo? ¡Da la vuelta, Vyse!\c"
MS09901402,"\h(«Drachma»)¡¡Necio!!
¡¿Adónde crees que vas?!
¡Estás saliendo de Valua!\e"
MS09901403,"\h(«Drachma»)¡Rhaknam anda por aquí cerca! ¡¡Esta vez
no permitiré que me arruines esta oportunidad
para cogerla!! ¡¡Da la vuelta, ya!!\c"
MS09901500,"\h(«Gilder»)¡Oye, oye!
¿Adónde te crees que vas, Vyse?
¡Por ahí se va a tierras de Valua!\e"
MS09901501,"\h(«Gilder»)¿No te parece que tenemos cosas mejores
que hacer que luchar de nuevo con los Valuan?
Deberíamos evitar esta zona.\c"
MS09901502,"\h(«Aika»)Un momento, Fina.
¿No es Valua eso de ahí delante?\e"
MS09901503,"\h(«Aika»)¿Y si a los Valuan les da por atacarnos?
¿Qué vamos a hacer, en este pequeño navío?
Creo que de momento es mejor no acercarnos.\c"
MS09901600,"\h(«Drachma»)¡¡Necio!!
¡¿Adónde crees que vas?!
¡Estás saliendo de Valua!\e"
MS09901601,"\h(«Drachma»)¡Rhaknam anda por aquí cerca! ¡¡Esta vez
no permitiré que me arruines esta oportunidad
para cogerla!! ¡¡Da la vuelta, ya!!\c"
MS09909940,"\h(«Aika»)¡Eh! ¡Mira por allí!
¡Hay una especie de remolino!
¡A lo mejor podemos meternos dentro!\e"
MS09909941,"\h(«Enrique»)Uj…… Quizás…… deberíamos ir……
esto…… a Esperanza, primero……\e"
MS09909942,"\h(«Enrique»)No sé…… si voy a aguantar mucho más……
sin…… ¡Buaj!\e"
MS09909943,"\h(«Aika»)Sí…… seguro…… ¿Pero qué vamos a hacer contigo,
Enrique? Supongo que no tenemos otra elección.
Vyse, ¡vamos hacia Esperanza!\c"
MS09909944,"\h(«Enrique»)Ujj……
Por favor…… ¿No podríamos…… pasarnos por
Esperanza primero? Os lo suplico…… ¡Buaj!\c"
MS09909945,"\h(«Vyse»)Creo que por aquí podemos introducirnos
en la Gruta Oscura.
¿Estás preparado, Enrique?\e"
MS09909946,"\h(«Enrique»)…… Sí, estoy listo. Supongo que no puedo elegir
de todas formas. Tenemos que atravesar la Grieta
Oscura, cueste lo que cueste.\e"
MS09909947,"\h(«Enrique»)No os preocupéis por mí…… Estaré bien.
No es ni el momento ni el lugar
para quejarme por mis continuos mareos.\c"
MS09902400,"\h(«Gilder»)Si yo fuera tú, me mantendría alejado de allí.
Hay todo tipo de seres horrendos
que viven por la zona.\e"
MS09902401,"\h(«Gilder»)Nunca lo elegiría como destino de mis
vacaciones. Me encantan las emociones fuertes,
pero creo que deberíamos dar la vuelta.\c"
MS09902402,\h(«Fina»)Aika…… creo que hemos ido demasiado al Norte.\e
MS09902403,"\h(«Aika»)Creo que tienes razón.
No sabemos lo que nos espera. Puede ser
peligroso ir de exploración ahora.\e"
MS09902404,"\h(«Aika»)Y según el mapa, no creo que la Isla de Daccat
esté al norte de aquí. Tenemos que dar
la vuelta y seguir buscando.\c"
MS09909952,"\h(«Gilder»)Si yo fuera tú, me mantendría alejado de allí.
Hay todo tipo de seres horrendos
que viven por la zona.\e"
MS09909953,"\h(«Gilder»)Nunca lo elegiría como destino de mis
vacaciones. Me encantan las emociones fuertes,
pero creo que deberíamos dar la vuelta.\c"
MS09909950,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… no vuelvas a la Isla de la Luna.
Te lo suplico.\e"
MS09909951,"\h(«Enrique»)Si me haces volver allí…… creo que me van a
fallar las fuerzas. No puedo permitirme que eso
suceda……\c"
MS09909960,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Qué es esto?
Hay algo insertado en el hueco de la estatua……\e"
MS09909961,\h( )｡Has recibido “Ojo del Hombre” x 1!\e
MS09909962,"\h(«Aika»)Eh, nadie va a darse cuenta de que nos lo
hemos llevado, ¿no? Además…… ¡somos Piratas
Aéreos! ¿No se supone que buscamos tesoros?\c"
MS09909963,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Mmm? Oye, Aika…… ¿no ves algo que brilla
en la tierra? Justo donde tendría que estar
el ojo de ese pájaro……\e"
MS09909964,\h(«Aika»)¡Tienes razón! Voy a ver qué es……\e
MS09909965,"\h(«Aika»)¡Oye, Vyse! ¡He encontrado algo! ¡Hay una gema
en el suelo! ¡Seguro que no echan de menos
una gema pequeñita y diminuta como ésta!\e"
MS09909966,\h( )¡Has recibido “Ojo del Pájaro” x 1!\e
MS09909967,"\h(«Aika»)Además, ¿quién sabe si esta gema
nos puede servir algún día?\c"
MS09909968,"\h(«Fina»)No……
No puedo creer que hayan recurrido
a las Lluvias Destructoras……\e"
MS09909969,\h(«Aika»)Fina……\e
MS09909970,"\h(«Gilder»)…… Vyse, quizá deberíamos volver a la
Isla de la Luna y reorganizarnos. De momento
no podemos hacer nada para ir a Soltis.\e"
MS09909971,"\h(«Vyse»)…… Tienes razón.
Odio hacer esto, pero creo que no nos queda
otra alternativa que volver a casa.\c"
MS09909972,"\h(«Vyse»)Sopla un viento muy fuerte del interior
de la Gruta Oscura.\e"
MS09909973,"\h(«Vyse»)Va a ser complicado pasar por ahí,
incluso con el Delphinus……\c"
MS09909974,"\h(«Vyse»)Mm…… Creo que hemos salido de la Gruta Oscura
por el mismo sitio por el que entramos.\c"
MS09909975,"\h(«Aika»)En el mapa del tesoro dice, “Los difuntos
siempre vigilarán mi tesoro.”\e"
MS09909976,"\h(«Aika»)Y hay una calavera en la parte este
del continente Valuan.
Me pregunto si tendrán alguna relación……\c"
MS09909977,"\h(«Vyse»)…… ¿Dónde estamos? ¡¿Por qué están
construyendo unos edificios en una isla
tan alejada?!\c"
MS09909994,"\h(«Vyse»)Es demasiado peligroso volver ahora.
Además…… no permitiré que la muerte
de Gregorio haya sido en vano.\c"
MS09909995,"\h(«Aika»)Ésta es la base de la Armada. Será mejor
que no nos acerquemos demasiado si no queremos
tener problemas. Vamos a dar la vuelta……\c"
MS09909978,"\h(«Aika»)¡¡Lo logramos!!
¡¡Hemos conseguido atravesar la Gruta Oscura!!\e"
MS09909979,"\h(«Enrique»)¡Al fin podremos ver lo que hay al este
de la Gruta Oscura!
¡Vamos a pasar a los libros de Historia!\c"
MS09909980,"\h(«Aika»)¡Caray! ¡Hay tantas hierbas y especias!
¡En la vida había visto tantas juntas!\e"
MS09909981,"\h(«Vyse»)Es asombroso……
Ésta sí que es una verdadera isla del tesoro.\e"
MS09909982,\h(«Fina»)Pero no debemos saquear la isla……\e
MS09909983,"\h(«Aika»)Sí…… supongo que si nos llevamos semillas y
cosas de esas, puede que los árboles no vuelvan
a crecer.\e"
MS09909984,"\h(«Aika»)…… Pero seguro que no pasa nada
si nos llevamos una cantidad pequeñita.
¿No crees, Vyse?\e"
MS09909985,"\h(«Vyse»)Eres la monda, Aika.
Tú y tus “cantidades pequeñitas”.
Está bien…… nos llevaremos unas pocas.\e"
MS09909986,\h( )｡Has recibido “Khale” x 1!\e
MS09909987,"\h(«Drachma»)El Rey de Ixa'taka mencionó una Cortina de Acero
al norte de este continente.\e"
MS09909988,"\h(«Aika»)Sí…… Pero si los Valuan escaparon
hacia el norte, tendrían que echar abajo
la Cortina de Acero, ¿no?.\e"
MS09909989,"\h(«Drachma»)Eso quiere decir que podremos llegar
al Océano Norte por ese camino.
Iremos a Valua desde allí.\c"
MS09909990,"\h(«Enrique»)La verdad es que el Delphinus
aún no está terminado.\e"
MS09909991,"\h(«Enrique»)Aún no hemos reforzado el casco, así que sería
imposible volar a través de arrecifes en este
momento.\e"
MS09909992,"\h(«Enrique»)Y todavía no se ha ajustado correctamente
la potencia del motor, así que no podremos
atravesar los arrecifes.\e"
MS09909993,"\h(«Enrique»)Si conseguimos arreglar el casco y el motor,
ni las grietas celestes ni los arrecifes
supondrán problema alguno para este navío.\e"
MS09909000,"\h(«Dyne»)Espera……
¡Ésa es la legendaria “Tumba del Pirata”!\e"
MS09909001,"\h(«Vicecapitán Briggs»)¡Buen trabajo, Vyse! ¡Seguro que el Gremio
de los Marinos estaría encantado de pagarte
espléndidamente por este Descubrimiento!\e"
MS09909002,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Gremio?
¿Pagarme por un Descubrimiento?\e"
MS09909003,"\h(«Dyne»)Hay muchas zonas de este mundo que no están
registradas en los mapas y siguen rodeadas de
leyendas…… ¡Quedan mucha cosas por descubrir!\e"
MS09909004,"\h(«Dyne»)En las principales puertos hay un Gremio
de los Marinos y pagan generosas cantidades
a cambio de información sobre Descubrimientos.\e"
MS09909005,"\h(«Dyne»)Si mientras navegas, la brújula empieza
a oscilar violentamente, significará que
muy cerca se oculta algún Descubrimiento.\e"
MS09909006,"\h(«Dyne»)Si rastreas la zona, seguro que lo encuentras.
Después dirígete al Gremio de los Marinos
y te darán una recompensa a cambio.\e"
MS09909007,"\h(«Dyne»)Pero si tardas en contarles tu descubrimiento,
es muy posible que otro explorador se te haya
adelantado. Ve siempre lo antes posible.\c"
MS09909008,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, antes de que zarpemos, ¿quieres
preguntarme algo?\e"
MS09909009,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decir?»)“¿Cómo se vira este cacharro?”
“¿Cómo se va a casa desde aquí?”
“Pues no.”\e"
MS09909010,"\h(«Vyse»)Sólo para asegurarme,
¿qué hay que hacer exactamente
para que el navío vire?\e"
MS09909011,"\h(«Dyne»)La verdad, me sorprende mucho
que me preguntes eso.
Hazme el favor de prestar atención.\e"
MS09909012,"\h(«Dyne»)Pulsa el botón analógico para moverte
hacia delante, atrás, izquierda o derecha.\e"
MS09909013,"\h(«Dyne»)Para controlar la altitud, usa los gatillos.
Con el gatillo Derecho el navío gana altitud y
con el gatillo Izquierdo el navío desciende.\e"
MS09909014,"\h(«Dyne»)Cuando quieras buscar algo o atracar en un
puerto, pulsa el botón A.\e"
MS09909015,"\h(«Vyse»)Mmm…… No te rías de mí, papá…… esto…… Capitán.
Pero no sé cómo se va a casa desde aquí.
¿Por qué no me dices hacia dónde debo ir?\e"
MS09909016,"\h(«Dyne»)¿Cómo quieres ser un buen marino
si no prestas atención a tu situación?
Ve en dirección Sudeste.\e"
MS09909017,"\h(«Dyne»)Con un poco de suerte, reconocerás la isla
cuando la veas…… Si te pierdes, puedes consultar
el mapa pulsando el botón START.\e"
MS09909018,"\h(«Dyne»)Además, en alguna ocasión te tropezarás
con algún monstruo. En ese caso, corre
hacia el embarcadero y acaba con ellos.\e"
MS09909019,"\h(«Dyne»)Una advertencia: existen unos monstruos, los
Maroccas, que viven por aquí. Son bastante
fieros.\e"
MS09909020,"\h(«Dyne»)Si el daño que inflinges en tu enemigo no es
suficiente, pulsa el botón Y para cambiar las
propiedades de tu arma. Funcionará mejor.\c"
MS09909021,"\h(«Dyne»)¡Muy bien!
¡A toda máquina!
¡Destino, la Isla del Pirata!\c"
MS09909022,"\h(«Drachma»)Eso me recuerda una cosa…… deberías haber
recibido una cosa que se llama el “Galón de
Capitán.”\e"
MS09909023,"\h(«Drachma»)Cada vez que ganes una gran batalla, recibirás
uno. Es como un trofeo.\e"
MS09909024,"\h(«Drachma»)Si “Usas” un Galón de Capitán, tu navío será más
fuerte.\e"
MS09909025,"\h(«Vyse»)Entiendo.
Gracias por tus consejos, Capitán.\c"
MS09909026,"\h(«Drachma»)Hemos conseguido un “Cañón Mágico”
de la Almirante.\e"
MS09909027,"\h(«Drachma»)Con él podremos disparar balas de cañón
cargadas de energía mágica.\e"
MS09909028,"\h(«Aika»)Como hacía Belleza, ¿no?
¡Eso es genial! Vyse, ¡¿has oído eso?!
¡Tenemos que sacarle partido!\e"
MS09909029,"\h(«Drachma»)Pero con cuidado. El Cañón Mágico consume mucha
Magia, igual que la magia normal.
Hay que intentar no abusar de él.\c"

géant. Elle est parsemée de récifs célestes et
d'îles.\e"

très fort, et mon navire s'est mis à trembler.
J'ai regardé sur le côté……\e"
MF90010005,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)…… et j'ai vu toute une flotte de vaisseaux de

flotte aussi grande, ils ont dû attaquer
quelqu'un.\c"

amiral dans ses rangs. Maintenant l'Armada
compte six flottes principales.\e"

première fois que je vois ce genre de navire !\e"

Vous l'avez volé !!! Soit vous êtes très
courageux…… soit vous êtes vraiment stupide !\c"

atteindre Yafutoma en passant par l'ouest ?
Attendez…… Je ne comprends pas……\c"
MF90010014,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)C'est incroyable…… Valua a été entièrement

MF91200001,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)J'ai appris que Gordo, le Pirate de l'Air, a
ouvert un restaurant là-bas, et que la cuisine y
est excellente !\c"
MF91200002,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Je ne vais pas laisser ce nouveau continent me
faire peur ! Le commerce n'a jamais été aussi
prospère que ces derniers temps.\e"
MF91200003,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Je sais que les Pirates de l'Air passent leur
temps à chercher des trésors, mais il nous faut
gagner notre vie honnêtement.\c"
MF90210000,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Si vous allez tout droit vers le nord, vous
tomberez sur Valua.\e"
MF90210001,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Soyez prudent, ils ne vous laisseront pas entrer
sans un Passeport Valuan. Et ne vous imaginez
pas que vous pouvez entrer en douce, les
patrouilles sont partout.\c"
MF90210002,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Vous êtes des pirates, n'est-ce pas ? Si c'est
le cas, évitez d'aller à Valua. S'ils vous
attrapent, vous êtes des hommes morts.\e"
MF90210003,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Valua a des lois très strictes sur la piraterie.
S'ils pensent que vous êtes un pirate, ils vous
conduisent au Coliseum pour vous exécuter.\c"
MF90210004,\h(«Navire Marchand»)Savez-vous ce qu'il s'est passé à Valua ?\e
MF90210005,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)On raconte que quelqu'un s'est échappé de la
Grande Forteresse. J'aimerais bien rencontrer
cet individu pour lui serrer la main.\c"
MF90210006,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)J'ai vu de nombreux navires de construction
Valuan dans la région. Ils doivent construire
quelque chose d'énorme.\c"
MF90210007,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Hé, savez-vous que Valua construit une nouvelle
base sur l'Île Dangral.\e"
MF90210008,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Aucun de vos navires ne peut voler assez bas
pour en avoir un aperçu, mais il y a beaucoup de
navires de construction dans la région.\e"
MF90210009,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Avec votre navire, vous pourrez peut-être voir
ce qu'il se passe. Allez vers le sud et
commencez à chercher sous les nuages.
Vous ne pourrez pas la rater.\c"
MF90210010,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Vous devriez pouvoir voir la base, si vous allez
vers le sud et cherchez sous les nuages.\c"
MF90210011,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Nous avons vu beaucoup de navires Valuan par ici
ces derniers temps, alors nous avons compris
qu'ils mijotaient quelque chose……\e"
MF90210012,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Mais je n'aurais jamais deviné qu'ils étaient
capables d'élever tout un continent de
Ciel Profond.\c"
MF90210013,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Je n'arrive pas à y croire! Vous êtes épatants !
Je n'aurais jamais pensé voir tous les Pirates
de l'Air unir leurs forces pour attaquer
l'Armada de plein front.\e"
MF90210014,"\h(«Navire Marchand»)Avec cette victoire, vous avez changé la face
du monde ! Qui sait ce qu'il serait arrivé si
l'Armada avait gagné ?\c"
MF90050000,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Bienvenue à Nasr, le royaume du désert !\e"
MF90050001,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Il y a le port Maramba non loin. Apparemment,
votre navire en a vu de toutes les couleurs.
Vous devriez peut-être vous réapprovisionner
là-bas.\c"
MF90050002,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)On dirait que votre navire vient de Nasr, mais
vous n'avez pas l'air Nasrean. Je dois vous
prévenir……\e"
MF90050003,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Avec un navire aussi petit, vous ne traverserez
jamais les récifs de pierre qui entourent notre
magnifique désert. Vous devriez faire
demi-tour.\c"
MF90050004,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Si vous allez en direction du sud-ouest, vous
atteindrez l'Océan Sud, il y a des vents
contraires là-bas, alors soyez prudent.\e"
MF90050005,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)C'est un territoire inexploré…… jamais personne
n'a réussi à traverser l'Océan Sud, bien qu'ils
soient nombreux à avoir essayé.\c"
MF90050006,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Le Cap Victoire ? J'en ai entendu parler.
C'est à la pointe sud de Nasr.\e"
MF90050007,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Si vous voulez y aller, bien que je ne vois pas
le but, vous devrez voler à travers le récif
céleste. Bonne chance……\c"
MF90050008,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Les objets du nouveau continent commencent à se
vendre sur les marchés du monde entier.\e"
MF90050009,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Nasrad a peut-être été détruite, mais tant qu'il
y aura de la marchandise à vendre, les marchands
comme nous survivront.\c"
MF90050010,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Soltis…… Oui, j'ai déjà entendu ce nom. C'était
le nom d'une ancienne civilisation. Certains de
nos historiens en ont gardé des récits.\e"
MF90050011,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Les légendes racontent que les Lunes ont poussé
le continent tout entier dans le Ciel Profond.\c"
MF90060000,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Bonjour, voyageurs !
Je suis un marchand du Royaume de Nasr.\e"
MF90060001,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Je fais essentiellement du commerce de tapis
et de Pierres de Lune Rouge.\c"
MF90060002,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Pendant les batailles navales, il arrivera que
vos canonniers perdent leurs cibles de vue.
À ce moment-là, un canonnier digne de ce nom
criera “Perdu”.\e"
MF90060003,"\h(ｫNavire Marchand Nasrｻ)Cela se produit souvent quand vos adversaires se
placent derri鑽e vous au c忖r de la bataille.\c"
MF90060004,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)J'ai appris que l'Armada Valuan a attaqué
Nasrad, et détruit la ville !\e"
MF90060005,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Je parie qu'ils ont aussi brûlé tout mon
magasin. Saletés de Valuans !\c"
MF90060006,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Mon magasin de Nasrad a disparu…… détruit
pendant l'attaque. Je ne sais pas du tout ce que
je vais faire maintenant……\c"
MF90060007,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)D'abord, l'Armada a rasé Nasrad, et maintenant
il semble qu'ils vont détruire le reste du
monde.\e"
MF90060008,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Je vous en prie…… Je sais qui vous êtes…… On m'a
conté votre bravoure…… Je vous en supplie. Je
vous en prie…… arrêtez-les. Vous êtes le seul à
pouvoir le faire.\c"
MF91060000,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Bienvenue à Nasrad, la capitale de notre
royaume !\e"
MF91060001,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Nous avons des richesses inimaginables……
Nous sommes vraiment bénis par la Lune Rouge.
Passez un bon séjour……\c"
MF91060002,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Votre navire est capable de voler sous les
nuages, vous avez dû voir des choses
surprenantes.\e"
MF91060003,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Je parie qu'il y a des créatures étranges et des
épaves là-bas ?\e"
MF90220002,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)La flotte Nasr protège nos routes du commerce
des Pirates Noirs. C'est pour cela que Nasr est
si lucrative. Tout le monde fait commerce avec
nous, parce qu'ils ne courent aucun danger.\c"
MF90220003,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)La capitale de Nasr, a peut-être été détruite,
mais l'esprit du peuple Nasr a survécu.
Ils ont déjà commencé la reconstruction.\e"
MF90220004,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Je sais qu'une nouvelle ville renaîtra des
cendres de l'ancienne.\c"
MF90230000,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Si vous continuez en direction du sud, vous
trouverez l'Océan Sud. Il est quasiment
impossible de le traverser.\e"
MF90230001,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Il y a des vents contraires très forts là-bas……
La plupart des navires ne résistent pas. Il vaut
mieux éviter à tout prix cette région.\c"
MF90230002,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Comment ?! Vous allez vraiment essayer de
traverser l'Océan Sud ? Mais, personne n'a
jamais réussi à le traverser !!\e"
MF90230003,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Ah la jeunesse de nos jours !
Vous risquez de vous faire tuer !
Eh bien, je vous aurai prévenu.\c"
MF90230004,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Comment ?! Vous voulez dire que vous avez
traversé l'Océan Sud et découvert un nouveau
continent ?\e"
MF90230005,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Humm…… Si c'est vrai, il sera peut-être possible
d'ouvrir une nouvelle route du commerce qui
passera par l'Océan Sud.\c"
MF90230006,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Nous avons essayé d'ouvrir une route du commerce
avec le nouveau continent qui traverse l'Océan
Sud, mais les vents contraires nous en ont
empêchés.\e"
MF90230007,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Les routes du commerce ont été ouvertes dans
l'Océan Nord, mais cela ne nous aide pas dans le
Sud.\c"
MF90230008,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Je ne sais pas s'il y a un rapport quelconque
avec l'apparition de cette île gigantesque, mais
les cieux de l'Océan Sud sont calmes.\e"
MF90230009,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Peut-être qu'à la fin de la guerre, je pourrai
ouvrir cette route du commerce vers le nouveau
continent, comme j'en avais l'intention.\e"
MF90230010,"\h(«Navire Marchand Nasr»)Je compte sur vous, Vyse ! Cela dépend de vous !
Imaginez les possibilités ! Pensez au profit !\c"
MF90150000,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)C'est la première fois que je vois un navire de
ce genre dans les environs. Je parie que c'est
un Marchand de Pierres de Lune venu déterrer des
Pierres de Lune Jaune.\e"
MF90150001,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Au fait, les Pierres de Lune de cette région ont
déjà été extraites, donc il n'en reste presque
plus.\e"
MF90150002,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Je pense que Valua essaie de s'agrandir parce
que nous devons trouver de nouveaux gisements de
Pierres de Lune le plus tôt possible.\c"
MF90150003,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Je pense que Valua essaie de s'agrandir parce
que nous devons trouver de nouveaux gisements de
Pierres de Lune le plus tôt possible.\c"
MF90150004,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Ah, nous protéger des Pirates de l'Air…… Bien.
C'est toujours agréable de voir que l'Armada
Valuan nous recherche.\e"
MF90150005,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)J'ai appris qu'il y a un Pirate de l'Air du nom
de Vyse qui se croit plus malin que l'Armada.
J'espère que vous l'attraperez !\c"
MF90150006,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Quel choc ! Le Seigneur Galcian s'est rebellé
contre l'Impératrice Teodora !\e"
MF90150007,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Je, je n'aurais jamais imaginé qu'une guerre
civile éclaterait dans notre glorieux empire !
Je me demande ce que le Seigneur Galcian
cherche……\c"
MF90150008,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Je n'en croyais pas mes yeux. Les Pierres de
Lune tombaient sur Valua…… comme de la pluie !\e"
MF90150009,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Quand la pluie s'est arrêtée, il ne restait
rien…… Valua a été détruite.\c"
MF90160000,\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Psitt ! Hé…… J'ai des armes Valuan ici……\e
MF90160001,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Je vends et j'achète des informations sur les
Découvertes. J'ai tout ce qu'il vous faut……\c"
MF90160002,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“Acheter et vendre du matériel naval.”
“Vous vendrez et achèterez des informations.”
“Partir.”\e"
MF90160003,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Il y a plusieurs années de cela, Valua a
découvert Ixa'taka et l'a conquise sur le champ.\e"
MF90160004,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Aujourd'hui c'est une colonie de Valua. Ils ont
réduit les habitants d'Ixa'taka en esclavage et
les obligent à extraire les Pierres de Lune.\c"
MF90160005,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Les forces Valuan se sont retirées de cette
région, et les Ixa'takans n'ont pas besoin de
matériel naval……\e"
MF90160006,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Je ne sais pas si les affaires vont durer encore
longtemps. Peut-être qu'il est temps que je me
recycle……\c"
MF90160008,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Vous avez entendu parler de Domingo, n'est-ce
pas…… C'est l'un des plus grands explorateurs de
notre temps.\e"
MF90160009,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Si vous cherchez un trésor dans cette région,
bonne chance. C'est difficile de trouver des
choses que Domingo n'a pas encore découvertes.\e"
MF90160010,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)La dernière fois que je l'ai vu, il a dit qu'il
cherchait le “Palais Ixa'taka.”\e"
MF90160011,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Les forces Valuan se sont retirées de cette
région, et les Ixa'takans n'ont pas besoin de
matériel naval……\e"
MF90160012,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Je ne sais pas si les affaires vont durer encore
longtemps. Peut-être qu'il est temps que je me
recycle……\c"
MF90160007,"\h(«Négociant de Matériel Naval au Marché Noir»)Je vole tout le temps dans les parages, donc si
vous passez par là, n'hésitez pas à vous
arrêter.\c"
MF90280000,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)L'Océan Nord est une route du commerce vitale
qui apporte à Valua de nouvelles marchandises
venues du nouveau continent en abondance.\e"
MF90280001,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Malheureusement, là où il y a de l'or à gagner,
il y a toujours des pirates pour le voler.
Soyez prudent !\c"
MF90280002,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Il y a quelques temps de cela, les amiraux
Belleza et Vigoro sont partis se battre avec
leurs flottes dans l'ouest……\e"
MF90280003,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Les deux flottes ont subi beaucoup de pertes.
Je me demande ce qu'il leur est arrivé ?\c"
MF90280004,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)D'autres marchands ont commencé à faire du
commerce avec le nouveau continent, et Valua est
en train de perdre le contrôle sur les axes de
commerce.\e"
MF90280005,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)J'ai entendu dire qu'il y a également des
dissensions au Palais Royal.\c"
MF90280006,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Notre capitale a été détruite. Notre règne
glorieux de la suprématie Valuan semble toucher
à sa fin.\c"
MF90290000,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Que pensez-vous de notre nouveau navire ?
Regardez un peu comme il brille ! Son nouvel
engin est même capable de foncer à travers les
récifs célestes.\e"
MF90290001,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Avec de tels navires, nous pourrons établir un
axe de commerce de Maramba à Esparanza !\c"
MF90290002,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)L'autre jour en volant près du Récif Noir, j'ai
été attaqué par une créature de la taille d'une
île.\e"
MF90290003,"\h(«Navire Marchand Valuan»)Je me suis échappé de justesse…… Je n'arrivais
pas à croire qu'elle soit aussi grosse…… Je n'ai
jamais rien vu d'aussi effrayant !\c"
MF90070000,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Votre navire est très différent.
Êtes-vous de l'ouest ?\e"
MF90070001,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Ces terres sont bénies par la Lune Verte.
Elles s'appellent Ixa'taka.
Nous habitons dans la forêt.\c"
MF90070002,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Notre peuple mange des baies et des graines.
Nous adorons manger des “Sardis Célestes” mais
elles sont plus difficiles à attraper que les
baies et les graines.\e"
MF90070003,\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Pourriez-vous m'apporter 10 “Sardis Célestes ?”\c
MF90070004,"\h(«Vyse»)Si vous voulez des “Sardis Célestes,” j'en ai
justement 10 ! Je vous les donne si vous
voulez.\e"
MF90070005,"\h( )Vous donnez 10 “Sardis Célestes” au capitaine du
navire.\e"
MF90070006,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Miam miam !
J'adore le poisson !\e"
MF90070007,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)J'en mangerai tous les jours, mais elles sont
trop difficiles à attraper.\e"
MF90070008,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Merci. Je vous suis très reconnaissant.
Acceptez cela en symbole de mon appréciation.\e"
MF90070009,\h( )Vous avez reçu “Abirik Cham” x 1 !\c
MF90070010,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Les “Sardis Célestes” étaient très bonnes.
Mais, j'ai une arête coincée dans la gorge !
Je crois que je les ai mangées trop vite.\c"
MF90080000,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Nos navires ont des ailes, mais il leur faut 
aussi du carburant Pierre de Lune.\e"
MF90080001,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Les navires Valuan crachent du feu.
Nous ne leur arrivons pas à la cheville.\c"
MF90080002,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Un Grand Oiseau déploie ses ailes…… J'ai déjà
entendu cette histoire, il y a bien longtemps.\e"
MF90080003,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)On raconte qu'aux alentours du lac nord, il y a
un Grand Oiseau qui n'est visible que du ciel.\c"
MF90080004,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Les Valuans ont abandonné la Montagne Pierre de
Lune.\e"
MF90080005,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Les gens qui avaient été pris en otages sont
retournés à Horteka. Je suis content qu'ils
soient sains et saufs.\c"
MF90080006,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Une multitude de navires Valuan sont arrivés.
Le navire avec le grand lance-flammes a fait un
trou dans le récif de pierre de l'ouest.\e"
MF90080007,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Mais ensuite, votre navire est sorti par ce
trou. Vous veniez d'où ?\c"
MF90080008,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Il y a un trou au bout du monde. Il est grand et
effrayant. Je vais éviter de m'en approcher.\e"
MF90080009,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)L'autre jour, je me suis approché du trou. Un
autre navire en est sorti. Tous les gens à bord
avaient les cheveux noirs. J'ai eu peur.\c"
MF90240000,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Nous étions cachés, mais maintenant que les
Valuans sont partis, nous pouvons de nouveau
faire voler nos navires.\e"
MF90240001,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Les Valuans se sont envolés par le mur de fer
dans la vallée du nord. Je crois que vous pouvez
aller à Valua d'ici.\c"
MF90240002,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Une multitude de navires Valuan sont arrivés.
J'avais peur et je me suis caché pour qu'ils ne
me voient pas. Ils sont passés à côté de moi, et
ils allaient en direction de l'ouest.\e"
MF90240003,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)Après un certain temps, les navires sont
revenus. Il y avait beaucoup de fumée sur les
navires. Je me demande ce qu'il s'est passé……\c"
MF90240004,"\h(«Navire Ixa'takan»)J'ai entendu un bruit effrayant venant des
cieux. Je me demande ce que c'était……\c"
MF90250000,"\h(«Ermite Ixa'takan»)Je vis à l'écart du monde dans cet endroit
tranquille, avec les fleurs et les insectes.\e"
MF90250001,"\h(«Ermite Ixa'takan»)Je vous suis reconnaissant d'avoir pris la peine
de venir me rendre visite, alors je vais vous
confier un petit secret.\e"
MF90250002,"\h(«Ermite Ixa'takan»)Au nord des terres de la Lune Jaune existe une 
merveilleuse fleur du nom de “Fleur Ballon.”
Elle est magnifique.\e"
MF90250003,"\h(«Ermite Ixa'takan»)Vous trouverez aussi une énorme volée d'insectes
voletant dans le vent si vous voyagez vers le
pays où Ixa'taka rencontre le Pays de la Lune
Rouge.\e"
MF90250004,"\h(«Ermite Ixa'takan»)…… Voyagez haut dans le ciel pour trouver des
“Papimouches.”\c"

“Papimouches.”\c"
MF90110000,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Je suis un pêcheur et depuis bien longtemps je
cherche un poisson appelé “Hamahai”.\e"
MF90110001,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Ce poisson “Hamahai” est une espèce très rare
que l'on trouve uniquement dans les cieux de
Yafutoma.\e"
MF90110002,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Ils rapportent beaucoup, évidemment. Si vous
avez le temps, vous devriez peut-être essayer
d'en pêcher.\c"
MF90120000,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Mais qui êtes-vous ? Et comment pouvez-vous
rester en l'air avec vos navires d'acier ?\e"
MF90120001,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Je sais qui vous êtes ! Vous venez de l'ouest !
J'ai lu beaucoup de livres sur les habitants de
l'ouest, mais vous êtes les premiers que je
rencontre !\e"
MF90120002,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Grâce au Prince Daigo, la flotte Tenkou a été
enfin reconnue comme faisant officiellement
partie de la Marine Yafutoman.\e"
MF90120003,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Ils ne sont pas obligés de rester dans les
rangs. En tant que Pirates de l'Air, ils ont de
meilleures tactiques de guérilla et savent mieux
aborder les navires ennemis !\c"
MF90120004,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Le Prince Daigo a déjà mis les voiles en
direction de l'ouest suivi du reste de la Marine
Yafutoman.\e"
MF90120005,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Je pense que Yafutoma a besoin du Prince Daigo
en tant que Capitaine de frégate. C'était une
erreur de l'exiler.\c"
MF90260000,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Le Mont Kazai est notre paysage le plus
impressionnant. Je ne pense pas que les navires
venus de l'ouest pourraient naviguer au-dessus.\c"
MF90260001,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Quoi ?! Vous voulez dire que votre navire peut
naviguer au-dessus du Mont Kazai ?!\e"
MF90260002,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Eh bien, je suis très impressionné.
Mes compliments à vos ingénieurs.\c"
MF90270000,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)Au-delà des cieux de l'est, il existe un récif
de pierre. J'y ai trouvé un trou, mais j'ai trop
peur de voler à proximité.\e"
MF90270001,"\h(«Navire Yafutoman»)L'autre jour, j'ai enfin trouvé le courage de
m'en approcher, mais j'ai vu quelqu'un à bord
d'un navire étrange, qui portait un masque,
alors je me suis envolé.\c"
MF90750000,"\h(«Gordo»)Il n'y a plus de poisson par ici depuis que
cette nouvelle île a surgi du Ciel Profond.\e"
MF90750001,"\h(«Gordo»)Celui qui m'enlève le pain de la bouche le
paiera cher. Vyse, j'espère que vous les
détruirez……\c"
MF90750002,"\h(«Gordo»)Qu'est-ce que c'était ? Vous cherchez du Gentum,
du Khale, et du Kabal ?\e"
MF90750003,"\h(«Gordo»)Je vois…… eh bien, on dirait que vous cherchez
des ingrédients exotiques.\e"
MF90750004,"\h(«Gordo»)Heureusement que nous servons du Kabal ici dans
mon restaurant. Je serai ravi de vous en
donner.\e"
MF90750005,"\h(«Gordo»)C'est toujours mieux de le mariner un jour ou
deux avant de le cuisiner…… c'est là que les
arômes commencent à se dégager. Le bon Kabal est
très rare……\e"
MF90750006,\h( )Vous avez reçu “Kabal” x 1 !\e
MF90750007,"\h(«Gordo»)Bon……
Vous cherchez encore les 2 autres
ingrédients, n'est-ce pas ?\e"
MF90750008,"\h(«Gordo»)Humm…… C'est une épice couramment utilisée à
Nasr, et elle est facilement reconnaissable à
son arôme.\e"
MF90750009,"\h(«Gordo»)Cela m'étonnerait que vous n'en trouviez pas à
Nasrad. Après tout, c'est la plus grande ville
commerciale au monde.\e"
MF90750010,"\h(«Gordo»)Et que cherchiez-vous d'autre ? Ah oui……
du Khale. L'“Épice des Rêves” comme on l'appelle
parfois.\e"
MF90750011,"\h(«Gordo»)Non seulement cela relève vos plats, mais cela
leur donne aussi bon goût.\e"
MF90750012,"\h(«Gordo»)Mais, j'ai entendu dire que les derniers arbres
Khale ont brûlé pendant la guerre Valua - Nasr.\e"
MF90750013,"\h(«Gordo»)À l'extrême est, il y a une île qui est
entièrement faite d'épices. Ce sera peut-être
votre jour de chance si vous trouvez cette île.\c"
MF90750014,"\h(«Gordo»)Je pense que vous trouverez du “Gentum” à
Nasrad.\e"
MF90750015,"\h(«Gordo»)Si vous cherchez du “Khale”, vous en trouverez
peut-être sur l'Île d'Épices dans l'Extrême Est.\c"
MF90750016,"\h(«Gordo»)Tiens, tiens…… Je vois que les informations que
je vous avais données sur le Gentum et le Khale
vous ont servi.\e"
MF90750017,"\h(«Gordo»)Si un jour vous avez d'autres questions
concernant les ingrédients exotiques, je pourrai
vous aider. On ne m'appelle pas le Pirate
Gastronome pour rien.\c"
MF90760000,"\h(«Daigo»)Voilà, Vyse. Ceux d'entre nous qui restent
assureront vos arrières. Allez Vyse, vous seul
en êtes capable.\c"
MF90760001,\h(«Jao»)Nous prions……\e
MF90760002,\h(«Mao»)…… pour votre victoire.\c
MF90780002,"\h(«Centime»)Vyse, si cela ne vous dérange pas, pouvez-vous
emmener mon fils, Hans, avec vous ?\e"
MF90780003,"\h(«Centime»)Il vous admire beaucoup. Et bien qu'il soit très
bon ingénieur, je pense que ce serait une très
bonne expérience pour lui.\e"
MF90780004,"\h(«Centime»)Je pense que le moment est venu pour lui de
partir seul et de se faire un nom dans le
monde.\e"
MF90780005,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse, emmenez-moi avec vous ! Je ferai de mon
mieux pour vous rendre service !\e"
MF90780006,"\h(«Que direz-vous ?»)“Bien sûr !”
“Désolé, je ne peux pas t'emmener avec moi.”\e"
MF90780007,"\h(«Vyse»)Bien sûr !
Un autre ingénieur de talent ne serait pas de
trop à bord de mon navire !\e"
MF90780008,\h(«Hans»)C'est vrai ? Merci beaucoup !\e
MF90780009,\h( )Hans l'“Ingénieur” a rejoint votre équipage.\c
MF90780010,"\h(«Vyse»)Désolé, mais je ne peux pas t'emmener avec moi.
Centime n'a donc pas besoin que tu travailles
sur son navire ?\e"
MF90780011,"\h(«Centime»)Ne vous inquiétez pas pour moi, Vyse. Je suis un
ingénieur accompli. Je lui ai appris tout ce que
je pouvais.\e"
MF90780012,"\h(«Hans»)Mon père m'a bien formé ! Mais je sais que je
peux apprendre encore beaucoup de choses en
travaillant sur votre navire ! S'il vous
plaît !\e"
MF90780013,"\h(«Vyse»)Je vois……
Entendu. Je t'emmène avec moi.\e"
MF90780014,\h(«Hans»)Merci beaucoup !\e
MF90780015,\h( )Hans l'“Ingénieur” a rejoint votre équipage.\c
MF90780000,"\h(«Centime»)Hans…… Tu devras travailler comme les autres sur
le Delphinus…… Et fait ce que le Capitaine Vyse
te dit de faire.\e"
MF90780001,"\h(«Hans»)D'accord, papa. Tu m'as bien formé, et j'obéis
toujours aux ordres. Je ferai de mon mieux pour
aider le Capitaine Vyse.\c"
MF90770000,"\h(«Vice Capitaine de Gilder»)Capitaine Gilder ! Vous pouvez nous confier le
Claudia ! Nous nous en occuperons !\e"
MF90770001,"\h(«Willy»)On s'en occupe ! Wrrack !
On s'en occupe !\c"
MF90790000,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, Gilder…… promettez-moi…… promettez-moi que
vous reviendrez. Je vous attendrai ici.\e"
MF90790001,"\h(«Clara»)Nous serons toujours ensemble. À votre retour,
nous admirerons le coucher du soleil. Ce sera
très romantique. Vous êtes beau à mourir.
Ma taille de doigt pour la bague est……\e"
MF90790002,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, mon Dieu ! Oh, mon Dieu ! Qu'est-ce que je
raconte !? Gilder, nous parlerons de cela plus
tard…… Revenez vite !\c"
MF90790003,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, Gilder…… promettez-moi…… promettez-moi que
vous reviendrez me voir !\e"
MF91160000,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, sur l'Albatros, tu as toujours fait de
ton mieux. Tu étais toujours le premier à
aborder un navire ennemi, et personne ne pouvait
t'arrêter.\e"
MF91160001,"\h(«Dyne»)J'ai toujours été fier de toi. Peut-être que je
ne l'ai pas toujours montré, mais tu ne m'as
jamais déçu.\e"
MF91160002,"\h(«Dyne»)Voilà, nous avons acculé l'ennemi. N'abandonne
pas, Vyse ! Je sais que tu peux y arriver !\c"
MF92000000,"\h(«Baltor»)N'allez pas vous faire tuer, Vyse !
C'est compris ?! Sachez que je ne l'accepterai
pas !\e"
MF92000001,"\h(«Baltor»)Je vous tuerai si vous mourrez en vous battant
contre ces clowns. Compris ?! C'est moi qui vous
tue ! Moi !\c"
MF09902000,"\h(«Aika»)La visibilité est affreuse !
Vyse, le brouillard est trop dense !
Je n'y vois presque rien !\e"
MF09902001,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est étrange…… Il n'y a jamais de brouillard
dans cette région…… Je me demande d'où ça
vient.\e"
MF09902002,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est le seul passage pour aller à Valua……
Réduit la vitesse de moitié……\e"
MF09902003,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, attends…… nous sommes trop près de cette
île là-bas !\e"
MF09903000,"\h(«Dyne»)Hé, tu te trompes de route.
Il n'y a que des grands cieux vides là-bas.\e"
MF09903001,"\h(«Dyne»)Fais demi-tour et retourne sur l'Île des
Pirates. Ce n'est pas le moment de faire
l'idiot.\c"
MF09903002,"\h(«Aika»)Hé, Vyse ! Tu ne vas pas dans la bonne
direction ! As-tu oublié comment lire une
boussole ?\e"
MF09903003,"\h(«Aika»)L'Île du Temple est au sud-ouest !
Quand la petite aiguille sera entre le “S” et le
“W.”\c"
MF09903004,"\h(«Aika»)Où vas-tu ? Nous devons retourner chez nous, sur
l'Île des Pirates !\c"
MF09909900,"\h(«Dyne»)Voilà l'Île du Temple. Certains racontent que
c'est une sorte de temple ancien, d'autres
pensent qu'il est hanté.\e"
MF09909901,"\h(«Dyne»)Nous n'avons pas le temps de jouer les
touristes. Fais demi-tour en direction de l'Île
des Pirates.\c"
MF09904000,"\h(«Patrouilleur Valuan»)L'Empire Valuan se trouve au-delà de cette
limite. Montrez-moi votre passeport d'entrée.\e"
MF09904001,"\h(«Patrouilleur Valuan»)Comment ?! Vous n'avez pas de passeport ?!
Je ne peux pas vous laisser passer !
Retournez dans votre trou !\c"
MF09904002,"\h(«Patrouilleur Valuan»)L'Empire Valuan se trouve au-delà de cette
limite. Montrez-moi votre passeport d'entrée.\e"
MF09904003,"\h(«Vyse»)Un passeport ? Justement j'en ai un.
Prenez le temps de l'examiner.\e"
MF09904004,\h(«Patrouilleur Valuan»)…… Humm. Parfait.\e
MF09904005,\h(«Patrouilleur Valuan»)Vous pouvez passer.\c
MF09906000,"\h(«Garde Aérienne de Nasr»)Nous sommes la Garde Aérienne de Nasr ! C'est
notre devoir de défendre le Détroit Dannel Sud.\e"
MF09906001,"\h(«Garde Aérienne de Nasr»)Le Détroit Dannel Sud est une zone limitée.
Aucun vaisseau non-autorisé ne peut traverser
sans une permission expresse.\c"
MF09906002,"\h(«Garde Aérienne de Nasr»)Vous ne pouvez pas entrer, même en essayant à
plusieurs reprises. Les vaisseaux non-autorisés
ne pourront pas franchir cette limite.\c"
MF09908000,"\h(«Drachma»)Écoutez. Cet endroit s'appelle l'Océan Sud.
Il est considéré comme l'un des endroits les
plus difficiles à naviguer.\e"
MF09908001,"\h(«Drachma»)Il y a un fort vent contraire qui souffle en
provenance de l'ouest. Personne n'a jamais
réussi à passer par là.\e"
MF09908002,"\h(«Vyse»)Ouah……
Ça a l'air amusant. Tentons notre chance.\e"
MF09908003,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot ! Ne le prenez pas à la légère !
Si c'était aussi simple, je ne vous mettrais pas
en garde comme cela !\e"
MF09908004,"\h(«Drachma»)Les petits navires sont déchiquetés par les
vents forts. Même les grands navires ont besoin
de beaucoup de puissance ne serait-ce que pour
avancer.\e"
MF09908005,"\h(«Drachma»)Le moteur du Little Jack n'est pas assez
puissant pour passer par ici. Il faut faire
demi-tour.\c"
MF09908006,"\h(«Drachma»)Voilà l'Océan Sud. Je croyais vous avoir prévenu
que nous ne survivrions jamais à cette
traversée. Faites demi-tour !\c"
MF09908007,"\h(«Bellena»)La région qui s'étend devant vous est l'Océan
Sud. À votre place je ferais demi-tour.\e"
MF09908008,"\h(«Drachma»)Il y a un fort vent qui souffle en provenance de
l'ouest. Les marins savent bien que c'est l'un
des endroits les plus difficiles à traverser en
navire.\e"
MF09908009,"\h(«Bellena»)Personne n'a jamais réussi à passer par là.
Et personne ne sait non plus ce qu'il y a de
l'autre côté.\e"
MF09908010,"\h(«Aika»)Ouah……
Je suppose que nous ne traverserons jamais à
bord de ce petit navire.\e"
MF09908011,"\h(ｫBellenaｻ)Les vents forts d馗hiquetteraient probablement
ce navire en un clin d'彿l.\e"
MF09908012,"\h(«Bellena»)Il nous faudrait un moteur beaucoup, beaucoup
plus puissant pour avoir une chance de
traverser.\e"
MF09908013,"\h(«Aika»)Vous avez probablement raison. Et puis…… nous
devrions partir tout de suite à la recherche du
Cristal de Lune Rouge. Allez Vyse ! Fais demi-
tour !\c"
MF09908014,"\h(«Bellena»)Je vous ai dit que c'est l'Océan Sud. Nous ne
pourrons jamais le traverser. Faites demi-
tour.\c"
MF09908015,"\h(«Drachma»)Écoutez. Cet endroit s'appelle l'Océan Sud.
Il est considéré comme l'un des endroits les
plus difficiles à naviguer.\e"

MF09908017,"\h(«Vyse»)Mais les terres de la Lune Verte sont
accessibles par là, n'est-ce pas ?\e"
MF09908018,"\h(«Vyse»)Et puis, nous avons le moteur de Belleza
maintenant. Nous avons peut-être une chance.\e"
MF09908019,"\h(«Drachma»)Humm……
Peut-être. Mais je ne connais pas bien cet
endroit. Vous êtes tout seuls.\e"
MF09908020,"\h(«Drachma»)Ce ne sera pas un voyage facile.
Préparez-vous au pire, les enfants.\c"
MF09909910,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse ! Voilà ! C'est ici que le Cristal de Lune
Rouge est enterré !\e"
MF09909911,"\h(«Vyse»)Formidable ! Atterrissons et partons vite
fouiller cet endroit !\e"
MF09909912,\h(«Drachma»)……\e
MF09909913,"\h(«Drachma»)…… Attendez.
Allez d'abord en ville. J'ai des choses à
faire.\e"
MF09909914,"\h(«Drachma»)Il y a une ville portuaire appelée Maramba près
d'ici. Allez-y en premier, compris ?\e"
MF09909915,"\h(«Vyse»)Hum…… d'accord. Pas de problème. Je me disais
que l'on pouvait…… hum…… tant pis. Cela n'a pas
d'importance.\c"
MF09909916,"\h(«Drachma»)Vous pouvez explorer le temple plus tard.
Allez d'abord à Maramba.\c"
MF09901100,"\h(«Drachma»)Pfut……
Alors voilà le Filet de Fer. J'ai entendu des
rumeurs à ce sujet.\e"
MF09901101,"\h(«Drachma»)J'ai appris que les Valuans l'ont construit pour
barrer le passage aux gens venus de l'Océan
Nord.\e"
MF09901102,"\h(«Drachma»)J'imagine qu'ils voulaient garder cette nouvelle
terre secrète.\e"
MF09901103,"\h(«Aika»)Je n'aime pas dire cela, mais je ne crois pas
que l'on va pouvoir traverser ce Filet.
Nous devrions faire demi-tour.\c"
MF09901104,"\h(«Drachma»)Nous ne pourrons jamais traverser ce Filet de
Fer. Faites demi-tour.\c"
MF09909920,"\h(«Haut Prêtre»)Venez-vous de l'est ?
Dans ce cas, je n'ai rien à vous dire.
Repartez là d'où vous venez !\c"
MF09909930,"\h(«Drachma»)Ces parties ressemblent aux quartiers généraux
Valuan.\e"
MF09909931,"\h(«Drachma»)Qui sait ce qu'il se passera si nous allons
faire un tour par là-bas. Mieux vaut ne pas trop
se rapprocher.\c"
MF09901400,"\h(«Drachma»)Que faites-vous ?! Essayez-vous de sortir de
Valua ?!\e"
MF09901401,"\h(«Aika»)Mais oui ! Nous sommes censés chercher le
Cristal Jaune non ? Fais demi-tour Vyse !\c"
MF09901402,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot !!
Où allez-vous comme ça ?! Vous êtes en train de 
sortir de Valua !\e"
MF09901403,"\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam est quelque part par ici ! Je ne vous
laisserai pas ruiner mes chances de le capturer
cette fois !! Faites demi-tour immédiatement !!\c"
MF09901500,"\h(«Gilder»)Hé, hé ! Où allez-vous comme ça, Vyse ?
C'est le pays des Valuans là-bas !\e"
MF09901501,"\h(«Gilder»)Vous ne croyez pas que nous avons mieux à faire
que chercher la bagarre avec les Valuans ?
Il vaudrait mieux éviter cet endroit.\c"
MF09901502,"\h(«Aika»)Attendez une seconde, Fina.
N'est-ce pas Valua là-bas devant ?\e"
MF09901503,"\h(«Aika»)Qu'allons-nous faire avec ce petit bateau si les
Valuans décident de nous attaquer ? Il vaudrait
mieux prendre nos distances pour le moment.\c"
MF09901600,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot !!
Où allez-vous comme ça ?! Vous êtes en train de
sortir de Valua !\e"
MF09901601,"\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam est quelque part par ici ! Je ne vous
laisserai pas ruiner mes chances de le capturer
cette fois !! Faites demi-tour immédiatement !!\c"
MF09909940,"\h(«Aika»)Hé ! Regardez là-bas ! Il y a un genre de
vortex ! Nous pouvons peut-être y pénétrer !\e"
MF09909941,"\h(«Enrique»)Pouah…… Nous…… Nous devrions peut-être aller
vers…… pouah…… Esparanza, d'abord……\e"
MF09909942,"\h(«Enrique»)Je ne sais pas……  combien de temps je peux
continuer…… comme ça avant de…… pouah !\e"
MF09909943,"\h(«Aika»)Ah…… Je vous jure…… Qu'allons-nous faire de
vous, Enrique ? Je suppose que nous n'avons pas
le choix pour le moment. Vyse, partons à
Esparanza !\c"
MF09909944,"\h(«Enrique»)Pouah……
Je vous en prie…… pourrions-nous…… nous arrêter
d'abord à Esparanza ? Je vous en supplie……
pouah !\c"
MF09909945,"\h(«Vyse»)Il semble que nous pouvons pénétrer dans le
Récif Noir par ici. Enrique, êtes-vous prêt ?\e"
MF09909946,"\h(«Enrique»)…… Oui, je suis prêt. J'imagine que je n'ai pas
vraiment le choix. Nous devons traverser le
Récif Noir coûte que coûte.\e"
MF09909947,"\h(«Enrique»)Ne faites pas attention à moi…… Ça va aller. Ce
n'est ni le moment ni l'endroit de se plaindre
du mal de l'air.\c"
MF09902400,"\h(«Gilder»)J'éviterais cet endroit si j'étais vous. Il
existe toutes sortes de créatures puissantes
dans cet endroit.\e"
MF09902401,"\h(«Gilder»)Ce n'est pas un endroit où je partirais en
croisière. Bien que j'aime les sensations
fortes, je pense que nous devrions faire demi-
tour.\c"
MF09902402,"\h(«Fina»)Aika…… Il semble que nous soyons allés un peu
trop au nord.\e"
MF09902403,"\h(«Aika»)Je crois que vous avez raison.
Qui sait ce qui nous attend. C'est peut-être un
peu dangereux d'aller explorer dans l'immédiat.\e"
MF09902404,"\h(«Aika»)Et d'après la carte, l'Île de Daccat ne se
trouve probablement pas au nord. Faisons demi-
tour et poursuivons nos recherches.\c"
MF09909952,"\h(«Gilder»)J'éviterais cet endroit si j'étais vous. Il
existe toutes sortes de créatures puissantes
dans cet endroit.\e"
MF09909953,"\h(«Gilder»)Ce n'est pas un endroit où je partirais en
croisière. Bien que j'aime les sensations
fortes, je pense que nous devrions faire demi-

MF09909950,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… ne retournez pas sur l'Île Croissant.
Je vous en supplie.\e"
MF09909951,"\h(«Enrique»)Si j'y retourne maintenant…… je…… j'ai peur que
ma détermination ne faillisse. Je ne peux pas me
le permettre……\c"
MF09909960,"\h(«Vyse»)Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Il y a quelque chose dans l'orbite de la
statue……\e"
MF09909961,\h( )Vous avez reçu “Oeil Homme Doré” x 1 !\e
MF09909962,"\h(«Aika»)Hé, personne ne s'apercevra de sa disparition,
n'est-ce pas ? Et puis…… nous sommes des Pirates
de l'Air !! Est-ce que l'on peut vraiment nous
en vouloir d'avoir pris un petit trésor ?\c"
MF09909964,"\h(«Aika»)Hé, tu as raison ! Je vais descendre voir ce que
c'est……\e"
MF09909965,"\h(«Aika»)…… Hé, Vyse ! J'ai trouvé quelque chose ! Il y
avait une gemme dans le sol ! Je suis certaine
qu'une minuscule gemme ne leur manquera pas,
si ?\e"
MF09909966,\h( )Vous avez reçu “Oeil GrandOiseau” x 1 !\e
MF09909967,"\h(«Aika»)Et puis, qui sait, cette jolie petite gemme
pourrait s'avérer utile ?\c"
MF09909968,"\h(«Fina»)Je……
Je ne peux pas croire qu'ils aient déclenché
les Pluies de la Destruction……\e"
MF09909969,\h(«Aika»)Fina……\e
MF09909970,"\h(«Gilder»)…… Vyse, nous devrions peut-être retourner sur
l'Île Croissant et prendre le temps de nous
ressaisir. De toute façon, il n'y a rien que
nous puissions faire pour rentrer dans Soltis.\e"
MF09909971,"\h(«Vyse»)…… Vous avez raison.
Je déteste vraiment faire cela, mais il semble
que nous n'ayons pas le choix, il faut retourner
chez nous.\c"
MF09909972,"\h(«Vyse»)Un vent incroyablement fort souffle à
l'intérieur du Récif Noir.\e"
MF09909973,"\h(«Vyse»)Cela ne va pas être facile de le traverser, même
avec le Delphinus……\c"
MF09909974,"\h(«Vyse»)Hum…… Il semble que nous soyons sortis du Récif
Noir par le même côté qu'à l'aller.\c"
MF09909975,"\h(«Aika»)Sur la carte au trésor il est écrit, “Les morts
veilleront toujours sur mon trésor.”\e"
MF09909976,"\h(«Aika»)Et il y a un crâne dans la partie est du
continent Valuan. Je me demande s'il y a un
rapport avec……\c"
MF09909977,"\h(«Vyse»)…… Où sommes-nous ? Pourquoi y a-t-il des
constructions sur une île aussi lointaine ?!\c"
MF09909994,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est trop dangereux d'y retourner pour le
moment. Et puis…… Je ne laisserai pas le
sacrifice de Gregorio être vain.\c"
MF09909995,"\h(«Aika»)C'est la base de l'Armada. Nous ne devrions pas
trop nous approcher, sinon nous aurons des
ennuis. Faisons demi-tour……\c"
MF09909978,"\h(«Aika»)Nous avons réussi !!
Nous avons réussi à traverser le Récif Noir !!\e"
MF09909979,"\h(«Enrique»)Eh bien ! J'ai du mal à croire que nous allons
vraiment voir ce qui se trouve à l'est du Récif
Noir ! Nous entrons dans l'histoire au moment
même où nous parlons !\c"
MF09909980,"\h(«Aika»)Ouah ! Il y a beaucoup d'herbes et d'épices qui
poussent ici ! Je n'en ai jamais vues autant au
même endroit !\e"
MF09909981,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est incroyable…… Cet endroit est vraiment une
île au trésor.\e"
MF09909982,\h(«Fina»)Mais il ne faut pas trop perturber l'île……\e
MF09909983,"\h(«Aika»)Oui…… Je suppose que si nous prenions trop de
graines et autres, les arbres risqueraient de ne
pas repousser.\e"
MF09909984,"\h(«Aika»)…… Mais je suis sûre que nous pouvons en prendre
un peu, n'est-ce pas Vyse ?\e"
MF09909985,"\h(«Vyse»)Je te jure, Aika. Toi et ton “juste un petit
peu.” D'accord, d'accord…… nous en emporterons
un peu.\e"
MF09909986,\h( )Vous avez reçu “Khale” x 1 !\e
MF09909987,"\h(«Drachma»)Le Roi Ixa'taka a parlé d'un Filet de Fer au
nord de ce continent.\e"
MF09909988,"\h(«Aika»)Oui…… Mais, si les Valuans se sont échappés vers
le nord, cela veut dire qu'ils ont dû démolir le
Filet de Fer, n'est-ce pas ?\e"
MF09909989,"\h(«Drachma»)Cela signifie que nous pourrons atteindre
l'Océan Nord par là. Nous irons tout droit vers
Valua.\c"
MF09909990,"\h(«Enrique»)En vérité, le Delphinus n'est pas encore fini.\e"
MF09909991,"\h(«Enrique»)La coque n'est pas encore complètement
renforcée, donc ce serait probablement toujours
impossible de traverser les récifs de pierre.\e"
MF09909992,"\h(«Enrique»)Et les réglages du rendement du moteur ne sont
pas terminés, alors nous ne pourrons
probablement pas traverser les récifs célestes.\e"
MF09909993,"\h(«Enrique»)Cependant, si nous pouvons trouver un moyen de
réparer la coque et le moteur, je suis certain
que les récifs célestes et les récifs de pierre
ne poseront aucun problème à ce navire.\e"

Me payer pour une Découverte ?\e"
MF09909003,"\h(«Dyne»)Il y a tant d'endroits à explorer, des lieux

MG90200001,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Dort drüben, das ist Sailors' Island.
Die Insel liegt genau in der Mitte der
Handelsrouten und ist ein guter Ort, um
Informationen zu sammeln.\c"
MG90200002,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Wow! Das ist aber eine eindrucksvolle Waffe,
die du da hast. He, ist das eine Harpoon

Felsklippen sprengen!\e"
MG90200003,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Wenn ihr diese Felsklippe passiert und weiter

Stützpunkt auf dieser großen Insel! Ich hoffe,

MG91200000,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Erst vor kurzem sind im North Ocean
Handelsrouten eröffnet worden!\e"
MG91200001,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Ich habe gehört, dass Gordo, der Luftpirat,
dort draußen tatsächlich ein Restaurant

sehr gut sein!\c"

MG90210000,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Wenn ihr von hier aus Kurs nach Norden nehmt,
kommt ihr nach Valua.\e"
MG90210001,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Seid vorsichtig, sie lassen euch ohne einen
valuanischen Pass nicht hinein. Und
hineinschleichen könnt ihr euch auch nicht,
weil es überall Patrouillen gibt.\c"
MG90210002,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Ihr seid Piraten, nicht wahr? Wenn ja, dann
würde ich mich an eurer Stelle von Valua
fern halten. Wenn sie euch erwischen, seid
ihr so gut wie tot.\e"
MG90210003,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Valua hat strenge Vorschriften gegen das
Piratentum. Wenn sie auch nur vermuten, dass
ihr Piraten seid, bringen sie euch zum
Coliseum, um euch hinzurichten.\c"
MG90210004,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Habt ihr gehört, was in Valua passiert ist?\e"
MG90210005,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Es kursieren Gerüchte, dass jemand tatsächlich
aus der Grand Fortress ausgebrochen ist.
Den Typen möchte ich gern mal kennen lernen
und ihm die Hand schütteln.\c"
MG90210006,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Ich habe zahlreiche valuanische Konstruktions-
schiffe in der Gegend gesehen. Die müssen an
einem ziemlich großen Projekt arbeiten.\c"
MG90210007,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)He, habt ihr gehört? Valua baut einen neuen
Stützpunkt. Sie bauen ihn auf Dangral Island.\e"
MG90210008,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Keines unserer Schiffe kann tief genug fliegen,
um es sich richtig anzusehen, aber es sind
viele Konstruktionsschiffe in der Gegend
gewesen.\e"
MG90210009,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Mit eurem Schiff könnt ihr vielleicht
herausbekommen, was da vor sich geht. Fahrt
gen Süden und fangt unter den Wolken mit der
Suche an. Es ist nicht zu verfehlen.\c"
MG90210010,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Wenn ihr von hier aus gen Süden fliegt und
unter die Wolken abtaucht, könnt ihr den
Stützpunkt sehen.\c"
MG90210011,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)In letzter Zeit hat es hier sehr viele
valuanische Schiffe gegeben, also nahmen wir
an, dass sie etwas vorhaben……\e"
MG90210012,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Aber ich hätte nie gedacht, dass sie einen
gesamten Kontinent aus dem Deep Sky heben
könnten.\c"
MG90210013,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Ich kann es nicht fassen! Ihr seid vielleicht
erstaunlich! Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass sich

Armada frontal angreifen würden.\e"
MG90210014,"\h(«Handelsschiff»)Dadurch, dass ihr diese Schlacht gewonnen habt,

MG90050001,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Hier in der Nähe gibt einen Hafen mit Namen
Maramba. Dein Schiff sieht so aus, als hätte
es viel mitgemacht. Vielleicht solltest du
dort ein wenig deine Vorräte auffrischen.\c"

Ich warne dich……\e"
MG90050003,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Mit einem so kleinen Schiff schaffst du es
nie durch die Felsklippen, die unsere schöne
Wüstenlandschaft umgeben. Du solltest umkehren.\c"
MG90050004,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Wenn du von hier aus südwestlich fliegst,
kommst du nach South Ocean, wo ziemlicher
Gegenwind herrscht, also sei vorsichtig.\e"

zum South Ocean geschafft, obwohl es viele
versucht haben.\c"
MG90050006,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Cape Victory? Davon habe ich schon gehört.
Es liegt an der südlichen Spitze von Nasr.\e"
MG90050007,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Wenn ihr dort hin wollt, obwohl ich mir nicht
vorstellen kann, dass jemand dorthin möchte,
müsst ihr durch Turbulenzen fliegen.

restlichen Welt.\e"
MG90050009,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Nasrad mag zwar zerstört worden sein, aber
solange es Waren zum Handeln gibt, werden
Händler wie wir überleben.\c"
MG90050010,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Soltis…… ja, diesen Namen habe ich schon
gehört. Es war der Name einer alten
Zivilisation. Einige unserer Historiker

MG90050011,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Den Legenden zufolge haben die Monde den
gesamten Kontinent in den Deep Sky geschoben.\c"
MG90060000,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Glück auf, Reisende! Ich bin ein Händler
aus dem Königreich von Nasr.\e"
MG90060001,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Ich handle vornehmlich mit Teppichen und
Red Moon Stones.\c"
MG90060002,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Während einer Schiffsschlacht verliert dein
Kanonier manchmal sein Ziel aus den Augen.
Jeder Kanonier, der sein Metier beherrscht,
ruft dann “verloren”.\e"
MG90060003,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Das passiert oft, wenn dir dein Gegner im Eifer
des Gefechts in den Rücken gerät.\c"
MG90060004,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Ich habe gehört, dass die valuanische Armada
Nasrad angegriffen hat und die Stadt zerstört
hat!\e"
MG90060005,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Ich wette, die haben auch meinen Laden
niedergebrannt. Verdammte Valuaner!\c"
MG90060006,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Mein Laden in Nasrad ist weg…… beim Angriff
zerstört. Ich habe keine Ahnung, was ich jetzt
machen soll……\c"
MG90060007,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Erst hat die Armada Nasrad dem Erdboden
gleichgemacht, jetzt sieht es so aus, als
würden sie auch den Rest der Welt zerstören.\e"
MG90060008,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Bitte…… ich weiß, wer du bist…… ich habe von
deiner Tapferkeit gehört…… ich bitte dich.
Bitte…… halte sie auf. Du bist der Einzige,
der das kann.\c"
MG91060000,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Willkommen in Nasrad, der Hauptstadt unseres
Königreichs!\e"
MG91060001,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Wir haben Reichtümer, die die kühnsten
Träume übertreffen…… der Red Moon meint es
wirklich gut mit uns. Einen schönen
Aufenthalt……\c"
MG91060002,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Wenn dein Schiff unter den Wolken fliegen
kann, hast du sicher ein paar erstaunliche
Sachen gesehen.\e"
MG91060003,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Ich wette, dort unten gibt es seltsame
Kreaturen und versunkene Schiffe, was?\e"
MG90220002,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Die nasrische Flotte schützt unsere
Handelsrouten vor Black Pirates. Deshalb
macht Nasr so viel Profit. Alle treiben sie
Handel mit uns, weil es sicher ist.\c"
MG90220003,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Die Hauptstadt von Nasr ist vielleicht
zerstört worden, aber nicht der Wille des
nasrischen Volkes. Sie haben bereits mit
dem Wiederaufbau begonnen.\e"
MG90220004,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Ich weiß, dass sich eine neue Stadt aus den
Trümmern der alten erheben wird.\c"
MG90230000,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Wenn ihr weiter gen Süden fahrt, gelangt
ihr zum South Ocean. Da hindurchzukommen,
ist nahezu unmöglich.\e"
MG90230001,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Dort gibt es einen unheimlich starken
Gegenwind…… die meisten Schiffe werden nicht
damit fertig. Das Beste ist, die Gegend ganz
zu vermeiden.\c"
MG90230002,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Was?!
Ihr wollt wirklich versuchen, den South Ocean
zu überqueren? Aber das hat noch nie jemand
getan!!\e"
MG90230003,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Was ist denn mit euch jungen Leuten von heute
los? Ihr könntet dabei zugrunde gehen! Sagt
nicht nachher, ich hätte euch nicht gewarnt.\c"
MG90230004,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Was?! Ihr wollt mir weismachen, dass ihr den
South Ocean überquert und einen neuen
Kontinent entdeckt habt?\e"
MG90230005,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Hmm…… wenn das wahr ist, dann kann man
vielleicht eine neue Handelsroute durch den
South Ocean eröffnen.\c"
MG90230006,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Wir haben versucht, eine neue Handelsroute
zu dem neuen Kontinent über South Ocean
einzurichten, aber der Gegenwind war zu stark.\e"
MG90230007,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)In North Ocean sind Handelsrouten eröffnet
worden, aber das bringt uns hier im Süden auch
nicht weiter.\c"
MG90230008,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Ich weiß nicht, ob es etwas mit dem Erscheinen
dieser großen Insel zu tun hat, aber der
Himmel von South Ocean ist ruhig.\e"
MG90230009,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Wenn der Krieg erst einmal vorbei ist, kann
ich vielleicht diese Handelsroute zu dem
neuen Kontinent eröffnen, wie ich es schon
immer wollte.\e"
MG90230010,"\h(«Nasr-Handelsschiff»)Ich rechne mit dir, Vyse! Alles hängt von dir
ab! Denk an die Möglichkeiten! Denk an das
Geld!\c"
MG90150000,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Ich glaube, so ein Schiff habe ich hier noch
nie gesehen. Ich wette, es ist ein Moon Stone-
Händler, der nach Yellow Moon Stones gräbt.\e"
MG90150001,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Nur damit ihr es wisst, die Moon Stones in
in diesem Gebiet sind schon abgebaut
worden, es gibt kaum noch welche.\e"

Es ist stets gut zu wissen, dass die
valuanische Armada sich um uns kümmert.\e"
MG90150005,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Ich habe gehört, dass es einen Luftpiraten
namens Vyse gibt, der denkt, dass er die
Armada an der Nase herumführen kann.
Ich hoffe, ihr kriegt ihn!\c"

Kaiserin Teodora rebelliert!\e"

glorreichen Kaiserreich je ein Bürgerkrieg
ausbrechen würde! Ich frage mich, was

MG90160004,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Heute ist es eine Kolonie von Valua.
Das Volk von Ixa'taka wurde zu Sklaven gemacht,
um Moon Stones zu fördern.\c"
MG90160005,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Die valuanischen Streitkräfte haben sich aus
dieser Gegend zurückgezogen, und die
Ixa'takaner benötigen keine Schiffsteile……\e"
MG90160006,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Ich weiß wirklich nicht, wie lange ich mein
Geschäft noch halten kann. Vielleicht ist es
an der Zeit, sich nach einer neuen
Beschäftigung umzusehen……\c"
MG90160008,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Ihr habt doch von Domingo gehört, nicht……
Er ist einer der größten Forscher unserer Zeit.\e"
MG90160009,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Wenn ihr in dieser Gegend nach Schätzen sucht,
dann viel Glück. Es ist nicht leicht, etwas
zu finden, das Domingo noch nicht entdeckt hat.\e"
MG90160010,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Das letzte Mal, als ich ihn sah, suchte er
nach dem “Ixa'taka Palace.”\e"
MG90160011,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Die valuanischen Streitkräfte haben sich aus
dieser Gegend zurückgezogen, und die
Ixa'takaner benötigen keine Schiffsteile……\e"
MG90160012,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Ich weiß wirklich nicht, wie lange ich mein
Geschäft noch halten kann. Vielleicht ist es
an der Zeit, sich nach einer neuen
Beschäftigung umzusehen……\c"
MG90160007,"\h(«Schwarzmarkt-Schiffsteile-Händler»)Ich fliege immer in dieser Gegend umher, wenn
ihr also demnächst hier vorbeikommt, schaut
mal rein.\c"
MG90280000,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)North Ocean ist eine lebenswichtige
Handelsroute, auf der eine Fülle neuer Güter
vom neuen Kontinent nach Valua gebracht wird.\e"
MG90280001,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Bedauerlicherweise gibt es immer dort, wo Gold
zu finden ist, auch Piraten, die es stehlen
wollen. Seid vorsichtig!\c"
MG90280002,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Die Admirale Belleza und Vigoro haben vor
kurzer Zeit ihre Flotten nach Westen verlegt,
um eine Schlacht auszutragen……\e"
MG90280003,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Beide Flotten erlitten schwere Verluste.
Was wohl mit ihnen geschehen ist?\c"
MG90280004,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Seit neuestem haben auch andere Länder den
Handel mit dem neuen Kontinent aufgenommen,
und Valua verliert die Kontrolle über die
Handelsrouten.\e"
MG90280005,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Ich habe außerdem gehört, dass es im
Königlichen Palast Unstimmigkeiten gibt.\c"
MG90280006,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Unsere Hauptstadt ist zerstört worden.
Die glorreiche Ära valuanischer Herrschaft
scheint zu Ende zu sein.\c"
MG90290000,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Was hältst du von meinem neuen Schiff? Guck
dir diesen Glanz an! Sein neuer Motor kommt
sogar durch Turbulenzen hindurch.\e"
MG90290001,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Mit Schiffen wie diesem wird es uns gelingen,
eine Handelsroute von Maramba bis nach
Esparanza einzurichten!\c"
MG90290002,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Neulich, als ich mich nahe des Dark Rift
aufhielt, wurde ich von einer Kreatur
angegriffen, die so groß war wie eine Insel.\e"
MG90290003,"\h(«Valuanisches Handelsschiff»)Ich bin gerade noch mit dem Leben
davongekommen…… ich konnte nicht glauben, wie
riesig sie war…… ich hatte noch nie im Leben
so viel Angst!\c"
MG90070000,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Euer Schiff ist ganz anders.
Seid ihr aus dem Westen?\e"
MG90070001,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Dieses Land gedeiht unter dem Green Moon.
Es heißt Ixa'taka.
Der Wald ist unser Zuhause.\c"
MG90070002,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Wir essen Beeren und Samen. Wir mögen sehr
gerne “Sky Sardis”, aber die sind schwerer
zu kriegen als Beeren und Samen.\e"
MG90070003,\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Könnt ihr mir 10 “Sky Sardis” mitbringen?\c
MG90070004,"\h(«Vyse»)Wenn ihr “Sky Sardis” möchtet, davon habe ich
gerade 10 hier! Ihr könnt sie haben, wenn
ihr wollt.\e"
MG90070005,"\h( )Du gibst 10 “Sky Sardis” an den Kapitän des
Schiffes.\e"
MG90070006,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Schmatz, schmatz……
Lecker! Ich mag Fisch!\e"
MG90070007,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Ich könnte sie jeden Tag essen, aber sie sind
schwer zu fangen.\e"
MG90070008,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Danke. Ich bin dir sehr dankbar.
Nimm dies als Zeichen meines Dankes entgegen.\e"
MG90070009,\h( )Du erhieltst “Abirik Cham” x 1!\c
MG90070010,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Die “Sky Sardis” sind sehr gut.
Aber mir ist eine Gräte im Hals
steckengeblieben! Ich habe wohl
zu schnell gegessen.\c"
MG90080000,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Unsere Schiffe haben Flügel, aber sie
benötigen auch Moon Stones als Treibstoff.\e"
MG90080001,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Die Schiffe der Valuaner speien Feuer aus.
Mit ihnen können wir es nicht aufnehmen.\c"
MG90080002,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Ein Großer Vogel breitet seine Flügel aus……
Diese Geschichte habe ich schon mal vor langer
Zeit gehört.\e"
MG90080003,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Irgendwo in der Nähe des nördlichen Sees soll
es einen Großen Vogel geben, der nur vom
Himmel aus sichtbar ist.\c"
MG90080004,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Die Valuaner haben Moon Stone Mountain
verlassen.\e"
MG90080005,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Die Leute, die man als Geiseln mitgenommen hat,
sind nach Horteka zurückgekehrt. Ich bin so
froh, dass sie alle in Sicherheit sind.\c"
MG90080006,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Viele, viele valuanische Schiffe sind gekommen.
Das Schiff mit dem großen Feuerrohr hat ein
Loch in die westliche Felsklippe geblasen.\e"
MG90080007,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Aber dann erschien euer Schiff durch dieses
Loch. Woher seid ihr gekommen?\c"
MG90080008,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Am Ende der Welt ist ein Loch. Es ist groß
und beängstigend. Ich halte mich fern davon.\e"
MG90080009,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Neulich bin ich in die Nähe des Lochs gegangen.
Noch ein Schiff kam heraus. Alle Mann an Bord
hatten schwarzes Haar. Ich hatte Angst.\c"
MG90240000,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Wir lebten in Verstecken, aber jetzt, wo die
Valuaner weg sind, können wir wieder unsere
Schiffe fliegen.\e"
MG90240001,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Die Valuaner sind durch die eiserne Wand über
dem nördlichen Tal weggeflogen. Ich glaube,
von dort aus kann man Valua erreichen.\c"
MG90240002,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Es kamen viele valuanische Schiffe. Ich
hatte Angst und versteckte mich vor ihnen.
Sie sind an mir vorbeigeflogen, in Richtung
Westen.\e"
MG90240003,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Nach einer Weile sind die Schiffe
zurückgekommen. Auf den Schiffen war viel
Rauch. Was wohl passiert ist……\c"
MG90240004,"\h(«Ixa'takanisches Schiff»)Ich hörte einen furchtbaren Krach aus Richtung
des östlichen Himmels. Was das wohl war……\c"
MG90250000,"\h(«Ixa'takanischer Einsiedler»)Ich lebe vom Rest der Welt abgeschnitten an
diesem ruhigen Ort, wo ich mit Blumen und
Insekten hause.\e"
MG90250001,"\h(«Ixa'takanischer Einsiedler»)Ich bin dankbar, dass ihr euch die Mühe gemacht
habt, mich hier zu besuchen, also will ich euch
ein kleines Geheimnis verraten.\e"
MG90250002,"\h(«Ixa'takanischer Einsiedler»)Nördlich des Landes des Yellow Moon gibt es
eine wunderbare Blume, “Balloon Flower” genannt.
Sie ist sehr schön.\e"
MG90250003,"\h(«Ixa'takanischer Einsiedler»)Wenn du in das Land, wo Ixa'taka an das Land
des Red Moon grenzt, reist, wirst du einen
riesigen Insektenschwarm vorfinden, der im Wind
flattert.\e"
MG90250004,"\h(«Ixa'takanischer Einsiedler»)……Um “Flutterflies” anzutreffen, muss man
hoch am Himmel reisen.\c"
MG90250005,"\h(«Ixa'takanischer Einsiedler»)Nördlich des Landes des Yellow Moon gibt es

MG90250007,"\h(«Ixa'takanischer Einsiedler»)……Um “Flutterflies” anzutreffen, muss man
hoch am Himmel reisen.\c"
MG90110000,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Ich bin Fischer. Ich jage schon seit einer
Weile einem Fisch namens “Hamahai” hinterher.\e"
MG90110001,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Dieser Fisch namens “Hamahai” ist eine
wirklich rare Art, die man nur im Himmel
über Yafutoma antrifft.\e"
MG90110002,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Sie erbringen natürlich einen guten Preis.
Wenn ihr Zeit habt, könntet ihr vielleicht
ein paar davon besorgen.\c"
MG90120000,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Wer seid ihr denn überhaupt? Und wie bringt
ihr es fertig, mit diesen Stahlschiffen in
der Luft zu bleiben?\e"
MG90120001,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Ich weiß, wer ihr seid! Ihr seid aus dem
Westen! Ich habe über die Leute aus dem
Westen gelesen, aber ihr seid die ersten
Westler, die ich zu Gesicht bekomme!\e"
MG90120002,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Dank Prinz Daigo ist die Flotte der Tenkou
jetzt als offizieller Teil der yafutomanischen
Marine anerkannt worden.\e"
MG90120003,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Sie brauchen sich um Hierarchie keine Sorgen
zu machen. Weil sie Luftpiraten sind, eignen
sie sich besser für Guerillataktiken und das
Entern von Feindschiffen!\c"
MG90120004,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Prinz Daigo ist bereits mit dem Rest der
yafutomanischen Marine gen Westen gesegelt.\e"
MG90120005,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Ich glaube, Yafutoma ist mit Prinz Daigo als
Marinekommandeur besser dran. Es war ein
Fehler, ihn ins Exil zu schicken.\c"
MG90260000,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Mount Kazai ist unsere größte
Sehenswürdigkeit. Ich bezweifle, dass Schiffe
aus dem Westen darüber hinwegfahren können.\c"
MG90260001,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Was?! Du willst mir weismachen, dass dein
Schiff über den Mount Kazai segeln kann?!\e"
MG90260002,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Tja, also, ich bin wirklich beeindruckt.
Mein Kompliment an eure Ingenieure.\c"
MG90270000,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Hinter dem östlichen Himmel gibt es eine
Felsklippe. Ich fand darin ein Loch, aber
ich habe zu große Angst, näher heranzufliegen.\e"
MG90270001,"\h(«Yafutomanisches Schiff»)Neulich hatte ich endlich den Mut, näher
heranzugehen, aber ich sah jemanden in
einem seltsam aussehenden Schiff, der eine
Maske trug, also nahm ich Reißaus.\c"
MG90750000,"\h(«Gordo»)Hier gibt es keine Fische mehr, seit die neue
Insel aus dem Deep Sky gestiegen ist.\e"
MG90750001,"\h(«Gordo»)Jeder, der mir Nahrungsmittel entwendet, wird
teuer dafür bezahlen. Vyse, ich hoffe, du
wirst sie vernichten……\c"
MG90750002,"\h(«Gordo»)Was war das?
Ihr such nach Gentum, Khale und Kabal?\e"
MG90750003,"\h(«Gordo»)Ach so…… Sieht so aus, als ob ihr nach
exotischen Zutaten Ausschau hieltet.\e"
MG90750004,"\h(«Gordo»)Glücklicherweise servieren wir hier in meinem
Restaurant Kabal. Ich gebe euch gern etwas
davon.\e"
MG90750005,"\h(«Gordo»)Es ist am besten, es ein oder zwei Tage lang
vor dem Kochen in eine Marinade zu legen……
dann kommen alle Geschmacksrichtungen zur
Geltung. Guter Kabal ist sehr selten……\e"
MG90750006,\h( )Du erhieltst “Kabal” x 1!\e
MG90750007,"\h(«Gordo»)Also, dann……
Ihr sucht noch immer nach den beiden anderen
Zutaten, nicht wahr?\e"
MG90750008,"\h(«Gordo»)Hmm…… drüben in Nasr ist es ein alltägliches
Gewürz, das man leicht an seinem Aroma
erkennen kann.\e"
MG90750009,"\h(«Gordo»)Es würde mich überraschen, wenn ihr es in
Nasrad nicht finden könntet. Es ist
schließlich die größte Handelsmetropole
der Welt.\e"
MG90750010,"\h(«Gordo»)Und wonach habt ihr euch noch umgesehen?
Ach, richtig…… Khale. Das “Traumgewürz”,
wie es manchmal genannt wird.\e"
MG90750011,"\h(«Gordo»)Es würzt das Essen nicht nur, sondern
verbessert auch den Geschmack.\e"
MG90750012,"\h(«Gordo»)Aber ich habe Gerüchte gehört, dass der letzte
der Khale-Bäume im Krieg zwischen Valua und
niedergebrannt ist.\e"
MG90750013,"\h(«Gordo»)Im Fernen Osten gibt es eine Insel, die einzig
und allein aus Gewürzen besteht. Wenn ihr diese
Insel findet, habt ihr vielleicht Glück.\c"
MG90750014,"\h(«Gordo»)Ich glaube, ihr werdet “Gentum” in
Nasrad finden.\e"
MG90750015,"\h(«Gordo»)Wenn ihr “Khale” sucht, das findet ihr
vielleicht auf Spice Island im Fernen Osten.\c"
MG90750016,"\h(«Gordo»)Sieh da…… wie ich sehe, waren die Informationen,
die ich euch über Gentum und Khale gegeben
habe, hilfreich.\e"
MG90750017,"\h(«Gordo»)Solltet ihr je wieder Fragen bezüglich
exotischer Zutaten haben, kann ich euch helfen.
Man nennt mich nicht umsonst den Feinschmecker-
Piraten.\c"
MG90760000,"\h(«Daigo»)Also, Vyse, es ist so weit. Wir werden dir
von hier oben den Rücken stärken. Los, Vyse,
du bist der Einzige, der dazu fähig ist.\c"
MG90760001,\h(«Jao»)Wir beten……\e
MG90760002,\h(«Mao»)……für deinen Sieg.\c
MG90780002,"\h(«Centime»)Vyse, wenn du einverstanden bist, könntest du
meinen Sohn Hans mit dir nehmen?\e"
MG90780003,"\h(«Centime»)Er hat große Achtung vor dir. Und obwohl
er schon ein ganz guter Ingenieur ist, glaube
ich, dass es eine gute Erfahrung für ihn wäre.\e"
MG90780004,"\h(«Centime»)Ich glaube, es ist an der Zeit, dass er sich
einen Namen in der Welt macht.\e"
MG90780005,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse, nimm mich mit dir mit! Ich werde mein
Bestes tun, um dir behilflich zu sein!\e"
MG90780006,"\h(«Was wirst du sagen?»)“Natürlich!”
“Tut mir leid, aber das geht nicht.”\e"
MG90780007,"\h(«Vyse»)Natürlich! Ich könnte einen guten Ingenieur
auf meinem Schiff gebrauchen!\e"
MG90780008,\h(«Hans»)Wirklich? Vielen Dank!\e
MG90780009,"\h( )Hans ist als “Ingenieur” zu deiner Crew
gestoßen.\c"
MG90780010,"\h(«Vyse»)Tut mir leid, aber das geht nicht. Braucht
Centime dich nicht auf seinem Schiff?\e"
MG90780011,"\h(«Centime»)Mach dir keine Sorgen, Vyse. Ich bin selbst
ein ziemlich guter Ingenieur. Ich habe ihm
alles beigebracht, was er kann.\e"
MG90780012,"\h(«Hans»)Mein Vater hat mich gut ausgebildet! Aber
ich weiß, dass ich wahrscheinlich auf deinem
Schiff noch viel mehr lernen kann! Bitte!\e"
MG90780013,"\h(«Vyse»)Verstehe……
Also gut. Ich werde dich mitnehmen.\e"
MG90780014,\h(«Hans»)Vielen Dank!\e
MG90780015,"\h( )Hans ist als “Ingenieur” zu deiner Crew
gestoßen.\c"
MG90780000,"\h(«Centime»)Hans…… du wirst dich auf der Delphinus selbst
durchschlagen müssen…… und das tun, was dir
Captain Vyse befiehlt.\e"
MG90780001,"\h(«Hans»)Mach ich, Dad. Du hast mich gut ausgebildet,
und ich folge immer Befehlen. Ich werde alles
tun, um Captain Vyse zu helfen.\c"
MG90770000,"\h(«Gilders Vizekapitän»)Captain Gilder! Du kannst uns die Claudia
ruhig überlassen! Wir werden uns um sie
kümmern!\e"
MG90770001,"\h(«Willy»)Überlass sie uns! Ruck!
Überlass sie uns!\c"
MG90790000,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, Gilder…… versprich mir…… versprich, dass
du zurückkommst. Ich werde hier warten.\e"
MG90790001,"\h(«Clara»)Wir werden immer zusammen sein. Wir werden
zusammen den Sonnenuntergang beobachten, wenn
du zurückkommst. Das wird so romantisch. Du
bist mein idealer Mann. Meine Ringgröße ist……\e"
MG90790002,"\h(«Clara»)Ach, du meine Güte! Du meine Güte! Was rede
ich denn da!? Gilder, das können wir später
besprechen…… Komm bald zurück!\c"
MG90790003,"\h(«Clara»)Oh, Gilder…… versprich mir, versprich, dass
du zu mir zurückkommst!\e"
MG91160000,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, auf der Albatross hast du immer getan,
was du konntest. Du warst immer der Erste, der
ein Feindschiff enterte, und keiner konnte
dich davon abhalten.\e"
MG91160001,"\h(«Dyne»)Ich bin immer stolz auf dich gewesen.
Vielleicht gab es Zeiten, in denen ich es
nicht gezeigt habe, aber du hast mich nie
enttäuscht.\e"
MG91160002,"\h(«Dyne»)Das ist es wohl dann. Wir haben den Feind in
der Hand. Gib nicht auf, Vyse! Ich weiß,
du schaffst es!\c"
MG92000000,"\h(«Baltor»)Dass dir jetzt nicht etwa was passiert, Vyse!
Verstehst du?! Ich möchte, dass du weißt,
dass ich das nicht hinnehmen kann!\e"
MG92000001,"\h(«Baltor»)Ich bring dich um, wenn du beim Kampf mit
diesen Clowns stirbst. Verstehst du?!
Dann bin ich der, der dich töten darf! Ich!\c"
MG09902000,"\h(«Aika»)Die Sicht ist grauenhaft!
Vyse, der Nebel ist zu dicht!
Ich kann kaum etwas sehen!\e"
MG09902001,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist seltsam…… in dieser Gegend gibt es
nie Nebel…… woher der wohl kommt.\e"
MG09902002,"\h(«Vyse»)Der einzige Weg, nach Valua zu kommen, ist
hier entlang…… geh auf halbe Geschwindigkeit……\e"
MG09902003,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, warte…… wir sind zu nahe an dieser
Insel dort drüben!\e"
MG09903000,"\h(«Dyne»)He, du fährst falsch.
Dort draußen gibt es nichts als Himmel.\e"
MG09903001,"\h(«Dyne»)Dreh um und fahr nach Pirate Isle zurück.
Du solltest jetzt nicht herumalbern.\c"
MG09903002,"\h(«Aika»)He, Vyse! Du fährst in die verkehrte Richtung!
Hast du etwa vergessen, wie man einen Kompass
liest?\e"
MG09903003,"\h(«Aika»)Shrine Island ist südwestlich von hier!
Das ist, wenn die kleine Nadel zwischen dem
“S” und dem “W” steht.\c"
MG09903004,"\h(«Aika»)Wohin fährst du? Wir müssen zurück nach
Pirate Isle!\c"
MG09909900,"\h(«Dyne»)Dies ist Shrine Island. Manche Leute sagen,
es wäre eine Art altertümlicher Tempel, andere
meinen, dass es dort spukt.\e"
MG09909901,"\h(«Dyne»)Wir haben keine Zeit für Besichtigungen.
Dreh das Schiff um und fahr zurück nach
Pirate Isle.\c"
MG09904000,"\h(«Valuanisches Patrouillenschiff»)Jenseits dieses Punktes liegt das Valuan Empire.
Den Pass, bitte.\e"
MG09904001,"\h(«Valuanisches Patrouillenschiff»)Was?! Ihr habt keinen Pass?! Ich kann euch
nicht erlauben, diesen Punkt zu überschreiten!
Geht zurück in das Loch, aus dem ihr
gekrochen seid!\c"
MG09904002,"\h(«Valuanisches Patrouillenschiff»)Jenseits dieses Punktes liegt das Valuan Empire.
Den Pass, bitte.\e"
MG09904003,"\h(«Vyse»)Einen Pass? Den habe ich hier.
Nehmen Sie sich ruhig Zeit, ihn zu studieren.\e"
MG09904004,\h(«Valuanisches Patrouillenschiff»)…… Hmm. Also gut.\e
MG09904005,\h(«Valuanisches Patrouillenschiff»)Sie können weiterfahren.\c
MG09906000,"\h(«Nasr-Luftwache»)Hier ist die nasrische Luftwache! Es ist
unsere Pflicht, die South Dannel Strait
zu verteidigen.\e"
MG09906001,"\h(«Nasr-Luftwache»)Die Southern Dannel Strait ist Sperrgebiet.
Kein Schiff darf hier ohne ordnungsgemäße
Genehmigung durch.\c"
MG09906002,"\h(«Nasr-Luftwache»)Ihr könnt hier nicht hinein, egal, wie oft ihr
es versucht. Kein Schiff ohne Genehmigung darf
diesen Grenzposten überschreiten.\c"
MG09908000,"\h(«Drachma»)Hör zu, Junge. Dieses Gebiet ist als South
Ocean bekannt. Es gilt als eines der
schwierigsten in der Luftfahrt.\e"
MG09908001,"\h(«Drachma»)Es herrscht ein starker Gegenwind von
Westen. Niemand hat es je geschafft,
da durchzukommen.\e"
MG09908002,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow……
Hört sich gut an. Probieren wir es mal.\e"
MG09908003,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot! Nimm das nicht so leicht! Wenn es so
einfach wäre, würde ich dich nicht vorher
warnen!\e"
MG09908004,"\h(«Drachma»)Kleine Schiffe werden von den rasenden Winden
in Stücke gerissen. Selbst große Schiffe
brauchen sehr viel Antriebskraft, nur um sich
vorwärts zu bewegen.\e"
MG09908005,"\h(«Drachma»)Der Motor der Little Jack schafft das nicht.
Wir müssen umkehren.\c"
MG09908006,"\h(«Drachma»)Das hier ist der South Ocean, mein Junge. Ich
dachte, ich hätte dir gesagt, dass wir hier
nicht lebend durchkommen. Los, wende das
Schiff!\c"
MG09908007,"\h(«Bellena»)Das Gebiet vor uns ist der South Ocean. An eurer
Stelle würde ich umkehren.\e"
MG09908008,"\h(«Bellena»)Hier weht ein starker Wind aus dem Westen.
Diese Gegend ist unter Seeleuten als eine der
schwierigsten bekannt.\e"
MG09908009,"\h(«Bellena»)Niemand ist je hier durchgekommen.
Und niemand weiß, was auf der anderen
Seite liegt.\e"
MG09908010,"\h(«Aika»)Wow……
Ich nehme an, mit diesem winzigen Schiff
schaffen wir es nie.\e"
MG09908011,"\h(«Bellena»)Dieses Schiff würde wahrscheinlich
augenblicklich von dem starken Wind zerrissen.\e"
MG09908012,"\h(«Bellena»)Um eine Chance zu haben, da durchzukommen,
bräuchten wir einen viel stärkeren Motor.\e"
MG09908013,"\h(«Aika»)Du hast wahrscheinlich Recht. Und außerdem……
wir sollten jetzt sowieso nach dem Red Moon
Crystal suchen. Also, Vyse! Mach eine
Kehrtwende!\c"
MG09908014,"\h(«Bellena»)Ich habe doch gesagt, dass das South Ocean ist.
Da kommen wir nie durch. Dreh das Schiff um.\c"
MG09908015,"\h(«Drachma»)Hör zu, Junge. Dieses Gebiet ist als South
Ocean bekannt. Es gilt als eines der
schwierigsten für die Luftfahrt.\e"
MG09908016,"\h(«Drachma»)Es herrscht ein starker Wind von
Westen. Niemand hat es je ganz geschafft.\e"
MG09908017,"\h(«Vyse»)Aber die Länder des Green Moon liegen auf
diesem Weg, nicht wahr?\e"
MG09908018,"\h(«Vyse»)Und außerdem haben wir jetzt Bellezas Motor.
Es ist nicht so, als hätten wir überhaupt
keine Chance.\e"
MG09908019,"\h(«Drachma»)Hmm……
Vielleicht. Aber meine Ortskenntnis ist
beschränkt. Sieh zu, wie du zurechtkommst,
Junge.\e"
MG09908020,"\h(«Drachma»)Das wird keine einfache Reise. Macht euch
auf das Schlimmste gefasst, Kinder.\c"
MG09909910,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse! Das ist es! Hier ist der Red Moon Crystal
vergraben!\e"
MG09909911,"\h(«Vyse»)Toll! Lasst uns landen und uns gleich ein
wenig umsehen!\e"
MG09909912,\h(«Drachma»)…………\e
MG09909913,"\h(«Drachma»)……Warte, Junge.
Geh zuerst in die Stadt. Ich muss mich noch um
ein paar Sachen kümmern.\e"
MG09909914,"\h(«Drachma»)Hier in der Nähe liegt die Hafenstadt Maramba.
Geh dort zuerst hin, hörst du?\e"
MG09909915,"\h(«Vyse»)Em…… klar. Kein Problem. Ich dachte nur, dass
wir…… em…… macht nichts. Es ist mir egal.\c"
MG09909916,"\h(«Drachma»)Den Tempel könnt ihr später erforschen.
Geh zuerst nach Maramba, Junge.\c"
MG09901100,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumpf……
Dies ist also das Eiserne Netz. Ich habe schon
viel davon gehört.\e"
MG09901101,"\h(«Drachma»)Ich habe gehört, die Valuaner haben es gebaut,
um zu verhindern, dass Leute vom North Ocean
hierher kommen.\e"
MG09901102,"\h(«Drachma»)Schätze, sie wollten nicht, dass Leute von
der Existenz dieses neuen Landes wissen.\e"
MG09901103,"\h(«Aika»)Es widerstrebt mir, es zuzugeben, aber ich
glaube nicht, dass wir durch dieses Ding
hindurchkommen. Wir sollten umkehren.\c"
MG09901104,"\h(«Drachma»)Es wird uns niemals gelingen, durch das Eiserne
Netz zu kommen, Junge. Los, dreh um.\c"
MG09909920,"\h(«Hohepriester»)Seid ihr Leute aus dem Osten?
Dann habe ich nichts mit euch zu bereden.
Geht dorthin zurück, wo ihr hergekommen seid!\c"
MG09909930,"\h(«Drachma»)Das sieht so aus, als ob es das valuanische
Hauptquartier in dieser Gegend sein könnte.\e"
MG09909931,"\h(«Drachma»)Wer weiß, was passieren kann, wenn wir da
einfach hineingehen. Wir sollten nicht zu
nahe herangehen, Junge.\c"
MG09901400,"\h(«Drachma»)Was machst du denn da, Junge?! Versuchst du,
aus Valua herauszukommen?!\e"
MG09901401,"\h(«Aika»)Ja! Sollen wir hier nicht nach dem Yellow
Crystal suchen? Mach kehrt, Vyse!\c"
MG09901402,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot!!
Was glaubst du denn, wo du hinfährst?!
Du nimmst Kurs von Valua weg!\e"
MG09901403,"\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam ist irgendwo hier in der Gegend! Ich
lass mich nicht nochmal von dir abhalten, ihn
zu kriegen!! Mach sofort kehrt!!\c"
MG09901500,"\h(«Gilder»)He, he! Wohin steuerst du denn, Vyse?
Das da drüben ist valuanischer Grund und
Boden!\e"
MG09901501,"\h(«Gilder»)Meinst du nicht, wir hätten etwas Besseres
zu tun, als einen Kampf mit den Valuanern
herauszufordern? Wir würden gut daran tun,
dieses Gebiet zu vermeiden.\c"
MG09901502,"\h(«Aika»)Moment mal, Fina.
Ist das da vorne nicht Valua?\e"
MG09901503,"\h(«Aika»)Was sollen wir mit diesem kleinen Boot
ausrichten, wenn die Valuaner uns angreifen?
Wir sollten uns fürs Erste von dort fern
halten.\c"
MG09901600,"\h(«Drachma»)Idiot!!
Was glaubst du denn, wo du hinfährst?!
Du nimmst Kurs von Valua weg!\e"
MG09901601,"\h(«Drachma»)Rhaknam ist irgendwo hier in der Gegend!
Ich lass mich nicht nochmal von dir abhalten,
ihn zu kriegen!! Mach sofort kehrt!!\c"
MG09909940,"\h(«Aika»)He! Schaut mal dort drüben! Da ist so eine
Art Strudel! Vielleicht können wir dort
hineinfahren!\e"
MG09909941,"\h(«Enrique»)Würg…… Viel…… vielleicht sollten wir zuerst
nach…… würg…… Esparanza fahren……\e"
MG09909942,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich weiß nicht…… wie lange ich das noch
ertragen kann…… bevor ich…… rülps!\e"
MG09909943,"\h(«Aika»)He…… also wirklich…… was sollen wir bloß mit
dir machen, Enrique? Im Moment wahrscheinlich
nicht viel! Vyse, lass uns Kurs auf Esparanza
nehmen!\c"
MG09909944,"\h(«Enrique»)Würg……
Bitte…… können wir nicht erst…… in Esparanza
anhalten? Ich flehe euch an…… rülps!\c"
MG09909945,"\h(«Vyse»)Es sieht so aus, als könnten wir auf diesem
Wege ins Dark Rift gelangen. Enrique, bist du
bereit?\e"
MG09909946,"\h(«Enrique»)……Ja, bin ich. Ich glaube sowieso nicht, dass
ich eine große Wahl habe. Wir müssen auf jeden
Fall durchs Dark Rift hindurch.\e"
MG09909947,"\h(«Enrique»)Um mich braucht ihr euch nicht zu sorgen……
mir geht es gut! Dies ist weder der Ort noch die
Zeit, sich über Luftkrankheit zu beschweren.\c"
MG09902400,"\h(«Gilder»)An eurer Stelle würde ich mich da fern halten.
In diesem Gebiet halten sich alle möglichen
mächtigen Kreaturen auf.\e"
MG09902401,"\h(«Gilder»)Das ist kein Ort, durch den man eine geruhsame
Reise macht. So sehr mir auch an Nervenkitzel
liegt, glaube ich doch, dass wir umkehren
sollten.\c"
MG09902402,"\h(«Fina»)Aika…… sieht so aus, als seien wir etwas zu
weit nördlich gefahren.\e"
MG09902403,"\h(«Aika»)Ich glaube, du hast Recht.
Wer weiß, was vor uns liegt. Es ist im Moment
vielleicht etwas zu gefährlich,
herumzuforschen.\e"
MG09902404,"\h(«Aika»)Und nach dem, was ich auf der Karte sehe, liegt
Daccat's Island sowieso nicht nördlich von hier.
Lasst uns umkehren und weitersuchen.\c"
MG09909952,"\h(«Gilder»)An eurer Stelle würde ich mich da fern halten.
In diesem Gebiet halten sich alle möglichen
mächtigen Kreaturen auf.\e"
MG09909953,"\h(«Gilder»)Das ist kein Ort, durch den man eine geruhsame
Reise macht. So sehr mir auch an ein wenig
Nervenkitzel liegt, glaube ich, wir sollten
lieber umkehren.\c"
MG09909950,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… geh nicht nach Crescent Isle zurück.
Ich bitte dich.\e"
MG09909951,"\h(«Enrique»)Wenn ich jetzt zurückgehe…… dann…… habe ich
Angst, dass mein Entschluss ins Schwanken
gerät. Das kann ich mir nicht erlauben……\c"
MG09909960,"\h(«Vyse»)Was ist das?
Da steckt etwas im Augensockel der Statue……\e"
MG09909961,\h( )Du erhieltst “Golden Man Eye” x 1!\e
MG09909962,"\h(«Aika»)He, keiner wird bemerken, dass es fehlt, oder?
Und außerdem…… wir sind doch Luftpiraten!!
Kann man uns wirklich einen Vorwurf machen,
wenn wir uns bei einem Schatz etwas bedienen?\c"
MG09909963,"\h(«Vyse»)Hm? He, Aika…… siehst du etwas Glitzerndes
auf dem Boden? Genau da, wo das Auge dieses
Vogels sein müsste……\e"
MG09909964,"\h(«Aika»)He, du hast Recht. Ich werde mal hinuntergehen
und nachsehen, was es ist……\e"
MG09909965,"\h(«Aika»)……Heda, Vyse! Ich habe etwas gefunden! Da
steckt ein Juwel im Boden! Ich bin sicher,
ein so klitzekleines Juwelchen wird keiner
vermissen, oder?\e"
MG09909966,\h( )Du erhieltst “Great Bird Eye” x 1!\e
MG09909967,"\h(«Aika»)Außerdem, wer weiß, wozu so ein kleiner Juwel
mal nützlich sein kann?\c"
MG09909968,"\h(«Fina»)Ich……
Ich kann es nicht glauben, dass sie tatsächlich
die Rains of Destruction eingesetzt haben……\e"
MG09909969,\h(«Aika»)Fina……\e
MG09909970,"\h(«Gilder»)……Vyse, vielleicht sollten wir nach Crescent
Isle zurück und uns eine Weile erholen.
Im Moment können wir sowieso nichts unternehmen,
um nach Soltis zu kommen.\e"
MG09909971,"\h(«Vyse»)……Du hast Recht.
Es gefällt mir gar nicht, aber es sieht so aus,
als hätten wir im Moment keine andere Wahl,
als in Richtung Heimat zu fliegen.\c"
MG09909972,"\h(«Vyse»)Aus dem Dark Rift weht ein unglaublich
heftiger Wind.\e"
MG09909973,"\h(«Vyse»)Es sieht so aus, als würde es sogar mit der
Delphinus schwierig, da durchzukommen……\c"
MG09909974,"\h(«Vyse»)Hm…… es sieht so aus, als wären wir auf der
gleichen Seite des Dark Rift herausgekommen,
in die wir hineingefahren sind.\c"
MG09909975,"\h(«Aika»)Auf der Schatzkarte steht “Die Toten werden
meinen Schatz stets bewachen”.\e"
MG09909976,"\h(«Aika»)Und da ist ein Totenschädel im östlichen Teil
des Kontinents von Valua. Ob das wohl
irgendwas zu bedeuten hat?\c"
MG09909977,"\h(«Vyse»)……Was ist das für ein Ort? Warum werden auf
dieser entlegenen Insel Gebäude errichtet?!\c"
MG09909994,"\h(«Vyse»)Es ist im Moment zu gefährlich, dorthin
zurückzugehen. Und außerdem…… Gregorios Opfer
sollte nicht umsonst gewesen sein.\c"
MG09909995,"\h(«Aika»)Das ist der Heimatstützpunkt der Armada. Wir
sollten besser nicht zu nahe heranfliegen,
sonst könnte es Ärger geben. Lass uns lieber
umkehren……\c"
MG09909978,"\h(«Aika»)Wir haben es geschafft!!
Wir haben das Dark Rift hinter uns gebracht!!\e"
MG09909979,"\h(«Enrique»)Also! Es ist unglaublich, aber jetzt können
wir endlich sehen, was östlich des Dark Rift
liegt! Wir sind dabei, Geschichte zu machen!\c"
MG09909980,"\h(«Aika»)Wow! Hier wachsen so viele Kräuter und Gewürze!
So viele habe ich noch nie an einem Ort
gesehen!\e"
MG09909981,"\h(«Vyse»)Es ist überwältigend…… das hier ist eine
wahre Schatzinsel.\e"
MG09909982,"\h(«Fina»)Aber wir sollten den Frieden der Insel nicht zu
sehr stören……\e"
MG09909983,"\h(«Aika»)Ja…… ich glaube, wenn wir zu viel von den
Samen und so wegnehmen, wachsen die Bäume
nicht mehr nach.\e"
MG09909984,"\h(«Aika»)……Aber ich bin sicher, ein bisschen kann nicht
schaden, nicht wahr, Vyse?\e"
MG09909985,"\h(«Vyse»)Also sowas, Aika! Du und dein “nur
ein kleines bisschen”. Also, in Ordnung……
wir werden etwas davon mitnehmen.\e"
MG09909986,\h( )Du erhieltst “Khale” x 1!\e
MG09909987,"\h(«Drachma»)König Ixa'taka sprach von einem Eisernen Netz
nördlich dieses Kontinents.\e"
MG09909988,"\h(«Aika»)Tja…… aber wenn die Valuaner gen Norden
geflohen sind, dann bedeutet das wahrscheinlich,
dass sie das Eiserne Netz heruntergenommen
haben, nicht?\e"
MG09909989,"\h(«Drachma»)Das würde bedeuten, dass wir den North Ocean auf
diesem Weg erreichen können. Von da aus fliegen
wir direkt nach Valua.\c"
MG09909990,"\h(«Enrique»)In Wahrheit ist die Delphinus noch nicht
ganz fertig.\e"
MG09909991,"\h(«Enrique»)Der Rumpf ist noch nicht verstärkt worden,
also wäre es im Moment wahrscheinlich nicht
möglich, durch Felsklippen zu fliegen.\e"
MG09909992,"\h(«Enrique»)Und die Anpassung der Motorleistung ist
auch noch nicht vorgenommen worden, also
können wir wahrscheinlich auch nicht durch
Turbulenzen fliegen.\e"
MG09909993,"\h(«Enrique»)Wenn wir jedoch eine Möglichkeit fänden, den
Rumpf und den Motor herzurichten, dann wären
Felsklippen oder Turbulenzen für dieses Schiff
sicher kein Problem mehr.\e"
MG09909000,"\h(«Dyne»)Wartet…… das ist das legendäre
“Pirate's Grave!”\e"
MG09909001,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Gute Arbeit, Vyse! Ich bin sicher, die Sailors'
Guild würde nichts lieber tun, als dich für
diese Entdeckung zu bezahlen!\e"
MG09909002,"\h(«Vyse»)Gilde?
Mich für eine Entdeckung bezahlen?\e"
MG09909003,"\h(«Dyne»)Ein Großteil dieser Welt ist noch unerforscht
und von Legenden umwoben. Ruinen, fremdartige
Kreaturen…… alles Mögliche wartet darauf,
entdeckt zu werden.\e"
MG09909004,"\h(«Dyne»)In jeder größeren Hafenstadt gibt es eine
Sailors' Guild. Dort bezahlt man Forschern
für ihre Entdeckungen gutes Geld.\e"
MG09909005,"\h(«Dyne»)Fliegt ihr durch den Himmel und euer Kompass
fängt an, wie wild auszuschlagen, dann bedeutet
das, dass es in der Nähe eine Entdeckung zu
machen gibt.\e"
MG09909006,"\h(«Dyne»)Wenn ihr die Gegend absucht, werdet ihr
wahrscheinlich eine Entdeckung machen. Danach
geht ihr einfach zur Sailors' Guild und holt
euch eure Belohnung ab.\e"
MG09909007,"\h(«Dyne»)Aber je länger ihr wartet, desto größer ist
die Chance, dass euch jemand zuvorkommt.
Also, besucht so bald wie möglich die Gilde,
ok?\c"
MG09909008,"\h(«Dyne»)Vyse, bevor wir losfahren, hast du noch
Fragen an mich?\e"
MG09909009,"\h(«Was wirst du sagen?»)“Wie steuert man dieses Ding?”
“Wie kommen wir von hier aus nach Hause?”
“Nein, eigentlich nicht.”\e"
MG09909010,"\h(«Vyse»)Nur um sicherzugehen, wie steuert man dieses
Ding eigentlich genau?\e"
MG09909011,"\h(«Dyne»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass du je so eine Frage
stellst. Na…… trotzdem, dann pass mal gut auf.\e"
MG09909012,"\h(«Dyne»)Mit dem Analog-Stick kannst du dich vorwärts
und rückwärts bewegen oder nach links oder
rechts drehen.\e"
MG09909013,"\h(«Dyne»)Die Höhe kannst mit mit der R- und L-Taste
regulieren. Die R-Taste bewegt das Schiff
nach oben, die L-Taste nach unten.\e"
MG09909014,"\h(«Dyne»)Immer wenn du etwas suchen möchtest oder
in einem Hafen anlegen willst, musst du die
Taste A drücken.\e"
MG09909015,"\h(«Vyse»)Em…… lach mich nicht aus, Dad…… äh…… Captain,
aber ich weiß nicht mehr, wie ich von hier
aus nach Hause komme. Könntest du mir sagen,
wo's lang geht?\e"
MG09909016,"\h(«Dyne»)Wie willst du je ein guter Seemann werden,
wenn du nie aufpasst, wo du hinfährst?!
Nimm Kurs auf Südosten.\e"
MG09909017,"\h(«Dyne»)Du wirst die Insel wiedererkennen, wenn du
sie siehst…… hoffentlich. Wenn du dich verirrst,
kannst du mit Hilfe der Start-Taste auf eine
Karte schauen.\e"
MG09909018,"\h(«Dyne»)Manchmal wirst du auch gelegentlich unterwegs
auf Monster treffen. Wenn das der Fall sein
sollte, renn aufs Deck und hol sie dir.\e"
MG09909019,"\h(«Dyne»)Ein Wort der Warnung: Hier gibt es diese
Monster mit Namen Maroccas. Sie sind ziemlich
hart im Nehmen.\e"
MG09909020,"\h(«Dyne»)Wenn du bei deinem Feind nicht genug Schaden
anrichtest, versuch's mal mit der Taste Y, um
die Eigenschaften deiner Waffe zu ändern.
Das funktioniert vielleicht besser.\c"
MG09909021,"\h(«Dyne»)Also dann! Volle Kraft voraus! Auf nach
Pirate Isle!\c"
MG09909022,"\h(«Drachma»)Dabei fällt mir ein…… du hättest etwas erhalten
sollen, das sich “Captain's Stripe” nennt.\e"
MG09909023,"\h(«Drachma»)Für jede größere Schlacht, die du gewinnst,
wirst du es erhalten. Das ist so in
etwa wie eine Trophäe.\e"
MG09909024,"\h(«Drachma»)Wenn du ein Kapitänsabzeichen “benutzt”,
wird es dein Schiff stärker machen.\e"
MG09909025,"\h(«Vyse»)Verstehe. Danke für den Rat, Captain.\c"
MG09909026,"\h(«Drachma»)Wir scheinen eine “Magic Cannon” von der
Frau Admiral bekommen zu haben.\e"
MG09909027,"\h(«Drachma»)Damit können wir Kanonenbälle abfeuern,
die mit magischer Energie geladen sind.\e"
MG09909028,"\h(«Aika»)Genauso, wie es Belleza gemacht hat, ja?
Das ist ja toll! Vyse! Hast du das gehört?!
Wir sollten dieses Ding nutzbringend einsetzen!\e"
MG09909029,"\h(«Drachma»)Sei aber vorsichtig, Junge. Die Magic Cannon
zu benutzen, verbraucht genauso viel MP wie
normale Magie. Also übertreib es nicht.\c"
