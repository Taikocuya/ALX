Not many people can boast discovering this many
things a single lifetime, you know.\e"

MI0020000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…
It's still hard for me to believe that Izmael
turned this deserted island into a base.\e"
MI0020001,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse…
Aika…
Enrique…\e"
MI0020002,"\h(«Fina»)Thank you for everything you've done. So far,
we've managed to get three of the Moon Crystals.\e"
MI0020003,"\h(«Fina»)I never would have made it this far on my own. 
Thank you so much.\e"
MI0020004,"\h(«Aika»)Come on, Fina!
You don't have to thank us!\e"
MI0020005,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah, if it wasn't for you, I don't think we
would've ever gotten the chance to sail around
the world! We should be thanking you!\e"
MI0020006,"\h(«Enrique»)Fina, I don't know if you realized it yet, but
your mission has helped us all. And we've all
grown to be such good friends.\e"
MI0020007,\h(«Fina»)Yes… Thank you… I mean you're welcome.\e
MI0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Until recently, I lived a sheltered life. I was
scared when the Elders asked me to search
for the Crystals… And I was alone.\e"
MI0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Since then, I've made some great friends,
and I get excited when we explore new lands…
Even the ones with monsters.\e"
MI0020010,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah… when you first heard what we did for a
living, you seemed really surprised… almost
intimidated.\e"
MI0020011,"\h(«Vyse»)You're sounding more like an Air Pirate every
day. Before you know it, you'll be dressing like
us… and Cupil will be wearing an eye patch.\e"
MI0020012,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, that reminds me.
Do you know where we should go to get the next
Moon Crystal?\e"
MI0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Yes, I do.\e"
MI0020014,"\h(«Fina»)To the far south, lies a land that basks in the 
cold light of the Purple Moon. 
It is known as the Land of Ice.\e"
MI0020015,\h(«Fina»)The Purple Moon Crystal should be hidden there.\e
MI0020016,\h(«Vyse»)Land of Ice?\e
MI0020017,"\h(«Fina»)The Purple Moon is the source of power for 
all Ice Magic.\e"
MI0020018,"\h(«Fina»)And because of that, the lands under the moon 
have become encased in ice.\e"
MI0020019,"\h(«Aika»)I've heard stories about that place… Some of 
the others back home used to tell me about 
the rumors they'd hear.\e"
MI0020020,"\h(«Aika»)I heard that the air is so cold, that anyone who
goes there will be frozen solid in a matter of
seconds…\e"
MI0020021,"\h(«Aika»)I don't want to have to chisel you out of the
ice, Vyse.\e"
MI0020022,"\h(«Vyse»)Where do you get these stories? First, I was 
going to catch on fire, then people were going 
to eat us with sticks, now I'm going to freeze.\e"
MI0020023,"\h(«Vyse»)Getting the Crystal is not going to be easy, 
but I think your overactive imagination is 
getting the best of you.\e"
MI0020024,"\h(«Aika»)What do you mean?!
Alright… fine. When you become a Vysicle,
don't come crying to me!\e"
MI0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Hahaha…
I'm sure everything will be alright.
I doubt it's that cold, Aika.\e"
MI0020026,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, according to our Valuan archaeologists…\e"
MI0020027,"\h(«Enrique»)Beneath the layers of ice, lies the ruins of an
ancient city. The ruins have been undisturbed
since the Old World.\e"
MI0020028,"\h(«Enrique»)Unfortunately, no one has ever been able to
break through the ice… All we have been able to
do is observe the ruins from the sky.\e"
MI0020029,"\h(«Vyse»)So we don't really need to go there because 
it's impossible to get the Crystal.\e"
MI0020030,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, I was thinking…
Brabham said that the hull had been reinforced,
right?\e"
MI0020031,"\h(«Enrique»)If the hull is strong enough to break
through stone reefs, perhaps it is strong
enough to break through the ice!\e"
MI0020032,"\h(«Vyse»)That might work! We could bust through the ice
with the Delphinus!\e"
MI0020033,"\h(«Fina»)If the Delphinus can get through the ice, 
then we can get the Crystal.\e"
MI0020034,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah.
Then it looks like our next destination is to
the south… to the Land of Ice!\e"
MI0020035,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, it looks like we've got a long journey
ahead of us. I think we should take the rest of
the day off and celebrate!\e"
MI0020036,\h(«Everyone»)Aye Aye!\e
MSI0020000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…

MFI0020000,"\h(«Vyse»)Humm……
J'ai encore du mal à croire qu'Izmael ait
transformé cette île déserte en base.\e"
MFI0020001,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse……
Aika……
Enrique……\e"
MFI0020002,"\h(«Fina»)Merci de tout ce que vous avez fait. Jusque là,
nous avons réussi à rassembler trois Cristaux de
Lune.\e"
MFI0020003,"\h(«Fina»)Je n'y serais jamais arrivée toute seule.
Merci beaucoup.\e"
MFI0020004,"\h(«Aika»)Viens, Fina !
Ce n'est pas la peine de nous remercier !\e"
MFI0020005,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui, c'est grâce à toi que nous avons pu faire
le tour du monde ! C'est plutôt à nous de te
remercier !\e"
MFI0020006,"\h(«Enrique»)Fina, je ne sais pas si vous vous en rendez
compte, mais votre mission nous a beaucoup
aidés. Et nous sommes tous devenus de très bons
amis.\e"
MFI0020007,\h(«Fina»)Oui…… Merci…… enfin de rien.\e
MFI0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Jusqu'à lors, je vivais recluse. J'ai eu peur
quand les anciens m'ont demandée d'aller
chercher les Cristaux…… Et j'étais seule.\e"
MFI0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Depuis, je me suis fait des amis formidables,
et j'adore explorer des nouveaux pays……
Même ceux où il y a des monstres.\e"
MFI0020010,"\h(«Aika»)Oui…… quand tu as découvert ce que l'on faisait
dans la vie, tu avais vraiment l'air surprise……
presque intimidée.\e"
MFI0020011,"\h(«Vyse»)Tu parles de plus en plus comme un Pirate de
l'Air. Bientôt, tu t'habilleras comme nous……
et Cupil portera un cache-oeil.\e"
MFI0020012,"\h(«Vyse»)Mais j'y pense.
Sais-tu où aller chercher le Cristal de Lune
suivant ?\e"
MFI0020013,\h(«Fina»)Oui.\e
MFI0020014,"\h(«Fina»)À l'extrême sud, il y a une terre où brille la
lumière froide de la Lune Mauve.
C'est le Pays des Glaces.\e"
MFI0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Le Cristal de la Lune Mauve devrait se cacher
là-bas.\e"
MFI0020016,\h(«Vyse»)Pays des Glaces ?\e
MFI0020017,"\h(«Fina»)La Lune Mauve est la source de pouvoir de la
Magie des Glaces.\e"
MFI0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Et voilà pourquoi, les terres qui se trouvent
sous cette lune sont prisonnières des glaces.\e"
MFI0020019,"\h(«Aika»)J'ai entendu parler de cet endroit…… Les gens de
chez moi me racontaient des rumeurs.\e"
MFI0020020,"\h(«Aika»)On m'a dit que l'air est froid, et que ceux qui
y vont, gèlent en quelques secondes……\e"
MFI0020021,"\h(«Aika»)Je n'ai pas envie de te sortir de la glace au
burin, Vyse.\e"
MFI0020022,"\h(«Vyse»)Où vas-tu chercher tout ça ? D'abord, j'allais
prendre feu, après les gens allaient nous manger
avec des baguettes, et maintenant je vais
geler.\e"
MFI0020023,"\h(«Vyse»)Cela ne va pas être facile de récupérer le
Cristal, mais je crois que ton imagination
débordante te joue des tours.\e"
MFI0020024,"\h(«Aika»)Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ?!
OK…… OK. Quand tu seras devenu un Vysicle,
ne viens pas pleurnicher !\e"
MFI0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Hahaha…… Je suis sûre que tout se passera bien.
Je ne crois pas qu'il fasse si froid que ça,
Aika.\e"
MFI0020026,"\h(«Enrique»)Bon, d'après nos archéologues Valuan……\e"
MFI0020027,"\h(«Enrique»)Sous les couches de glace, se trouvent les
ruines d'une ancienne cité. Les ruines sont
restées intactes depuis l'Ancien Monde.\e"
MFI0020028,"\h(«Enrique»)Malheureusement, jamais personne n'a réussi à
percer la glace…… Nous n'avons pu qu'observer
les ruines du ciel.\e"
MFI0020029,"\h(«Vyse»)Donc nous n'avons pas vraiment besoin d'y aller
puisque c'est impossible de récupérer le
Cristal.\e"
MFI0020030,"\h(«Enrique»)Eh bien, je me disais……
Brabham a dit qu'il a renforcé la coque,
n'est ce pas ?\e"
MFI0020031,"\h(«Enrique»)Si la coque est assez solide pour traverser les
récifs, peut-être qu'elle peut percer la glace !\e"
MFI0020032,"\h(«Vyse»)Cela peut marcher ! Nous pourrions faire
exploser la glace avec le Delphinus !\e"
MFI0020033,"\h(«Fina»)Si le Delphinus peut traverser la glace,
nous pourrons atteindre le Cristal.\e"
MFI0020034,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui.
Dans ce cas notre prochaine destination sera le
sud…… vers le Pays des Glaces !\e"
MFI0020035,"\h(«Vyse»)Bon, un long voyage nous attend. Je pense que
nous devrions arrêter de travailler pour
aujourd'hui et faire la fête !\e"
MFI0020036,\h(«Tous»)À vos ordres !\e
MGI0020000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm……
Ich kann es immer noch nicht fassen,
dass Izmael diese einsame Insel in einen
Fliegerhorst verwandelt hat.\e"
MGI0020001,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse……
Aika……
Enrique……\e"
MGI0020002,"\h(«Fina»)Danke für alles, was ihr getan habt. Bis jetzt
ist es uns gelungen, drei der Moon Crystals
zu finden.\e"
MGI0020003,"\h(«Fina»)Das hätte ich allein nie geschafft.
Habt vielen Dank.\e"
MGI0020004,"\h(«Aika»)Aber, aber, Fina!
Du brauchst uns doch nicht zu danken!\e"
MGI0020005,"\h(«Vyse»)Genau! Wenn du nicht gewesen wärst, hätten wir
nie die Gelegenheit gehabt, die Welt zu
umsegeln! Wir sollten dir danken!\e"
MGI0020006,"\h(«Enrique»)Fina, ich weiß nicht, ob du es schon bemerkt
hast, aber deine Mission hat uns allen
geholfen. Und wir sind alle so gute Freunde
geworden.\e"
MGI0020007,"\h(«Fina»)Ja…… danke…… oder besser, gern geschehen.\e"
MGI0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Bis vor kurzem habe ich ein wohlbehütetes
Leben geführt. Ich habe mich gefürchtet, als
die Elders mich baten, nach den Kristallen zu
suchen…… und ich war so allein.\e"
MGI0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Seitdem habe ich tolle Freundschaften
geschlossen, und ich finde es aufregend,
neue Länder zu entdecken…… sogar welche
mit Monstern.\e"
MGI0020010,"\h(«Aika»)Ja…… als du damals gehört hast, wie wir leben,
warst du richtig überrascht…… fast etwas
eingeschüchtert.\e"
MGI0020011,"\h(«Vyse»)Du hörst dich von Tag zu Tag mehr wie ein
Luftpirat an. Bevor du dich's versiehst,
kleidest du dich wie einer von uns…… und
Cupil bekommt eine Augenklappe.\e"
MGI0020012,"\h(«Vyse»)He, da fällt mir etwas ein.
Weißt du, wo wir hingehen müssen, um den
nächsten Moon Crystal zu finden?\e"
MGI0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Ja, das weiß ich.\e"
MGI0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Tief im Süden liegt ein Land, das sich im
kalten Licht des Purple Moon sonnt. Es ist
als das Land of Ice bekannt.\e"
MGI0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Der Purple Moon Crystal müsste dort versteckt
sein.\e"
MGI0020016,\h(«Vyse»)Land of Ice?\e
MGI0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Der Purple Moon ist die Kraftquelle für alle
Ice Magic.\e"
MGI0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Und deshalb wurde das Land unter diesem Mond
in Eis eingebettet.\e"
MGI0020019,"\h(«Aika»)Ich habe Geschichten über diesen Ort gehört……
Die Leute daheim haben mir die Gerüchte
erzählt, die sie aufgeschnappt hatten.\e"
MGI0020020,"\h(«Aika»)Die Luft soll so kalt sein, dass jeder,
der dort hingeht, innerhalb von Sekunden
völlig zu Eis erstarrt……\e"
MGI0020021,"\h(«Aika»)Ich möchte dich nicht aus dem Eis
herausschlagen müssen, Vyse.\e"
MGI0020022,"\h(«Vyse»)Woher hast du bloß all diese Geschichten?
Erst sollte ich Feuer fangen, dann sollten
sie uns mit Stäbchen verspeisen, und jetzt
werde ich auch noch erfrieren.\e"
MGI0020023,"\h(«Vyse»)Es wird nicht so einfach sein, den Kristall zu
bekommen, aber ich glaube, deine Fantasie
geht langsam mit dir durch.\e"
MGI0020024,"\h(«Aika»)Was willst du damit sagen?!
Na schön. Aber wenn du zu einem Vyse-Zapfen
gefrierst, dann komm nicht zu mir
und beschwer dich!\e"
MGI0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Hahaha……
Das wird schon gutgehen.
Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass es so
kalt ist, Aika.\e"
MGI0020026,"\h(«Enrique»)Nun, nach dem, was die valuanischen
Archäologen behaupten……\e"
MGI0020027,"\h(«Enrique»)Unter den Eisschichten liegen die Ruinen einer
altertümlichen Stadt. Sie sind seit der Alten
Welt nicht mehr aufgesucht worden.\e"
MGI0020028,"\h(«Enrique»)Leider ist es nie jemandem gelungen, durch das
Eis hindurch zu kommen…… Wir konnten die Ruinen
lediglich vom Himmel aus beobachten.\e"
MGI0020029,"\h(«Vyse»)Also brauchen wir nicht dorthin fahren, wenn
es sowieso unmöglich ist, den Kristall zu
herauszubekommen.\e"
MGI0020030,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich dachte nur……
Brabham hat doch gesagt, dass er den Rumpf
verstärkt hätte, oder?\e"
MGI0020031,"\h(«Enrique»)Wenn der Rumpf stark genug ist, um durch
Felsklippen zu fliegen, dann ist er vielleicht
auch stark genug, um das Eis aufzubrechen!\e"
MGI0020032,"\h(«Vyse»)Das könnte gehen! Wir könnten das Eis mit der
Delphinus aufbrechen!\e"
MGI0020033,"\h(«Fina»)Wenn die Delphinus es schafft, das Eis
aufzubrechen, können wir uns den Kritall
holen.\e"
MGI0020034,"\h(«Vyse»)Genau.
Sieht so aus, als müssten wir südwärts fliegen……
zum Land of Ice!\e"
MGI0020035,"\h(«Vyse»)Dann haben wir eine lange Reise vor uns.
Ich finde, wir sollten den restlichen Tag
frei nehmen und ein bisschen feiern!\e"
MGI0020036,\h(«Alle»)Aye Aye!\e
MI0100000,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright… we've got the Purple Crystal. 
All that's left are Yellow and Silver.\e"
MI0100001,"\h(«Fina»)The Silvite Elders already have the Silver 
Crystal.\e"
MI0100002,"\h(«Fina»)So we really only have to worry about the Yellow
Crystal.\e"
MI0100003,\h(«Aika»)It looks like our mission is almost finished.\e
MI0100004,"\h(«Aika»)But wait… wasn't the Yellow Crystal located in
the Maw of Tartas in Valua?\e"
MI0100005,"\h(«Aika»)Last time we went there, we couldn't get in
because the opening was sealed.\e"
MI0100006,"\h(«Enrique»)Yes, the Valuans have made several unsuccessful
attempts at removing the seal…\e"
MI0100007,"\h(«Enrique»)But, perhaps we might be able to bypass the seal
with the Delphinus' new engine.\e"
MI0100008,"\h(«Enrique»)According to the geologists of the Valuan
Empire…\e"
MI0100009,"\h(«Enrique»)The lower layers of the Valuan Islands are
filled with cracks and fissures.\e"
MI0100010,"\h(«Enrique»)In other words, there is a whole system of 
subterranean tunnels running through Valua.\e"
MI0100011,"\h(«Aika»)So all we have to do is fly around underneath 
Valua and look for an opening.\e"
MI0100012,"\h(«Vyse»)I see…
So, in other words, if we can't get in from the
top, we'll try and get in from the bottom!\e"
MI0100013,"\h(«Vyse»)We'll fly below Valua and look for an opening
underneath the island! Once we get inside the
tunnels, we should be able to find the Crystal.\e"
MI0100014,"\h(«Aika»)Since we can fly higher and lower than we ever
have before, we might as well take advantage of
it.\e"
MI0100015,"\h(«Vyse»)Exactly.
Let's rest up today. We'll leave for Valua first
thing tomorrow morning.\e"
MSI0100000,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright… we've got the Purple Crystal. 
All that's left are Yellow and Silver.\e"
MSI0100001,"\h(«Fina»)The Silvite Elders already have the Silver 
Crystal.\e"

MSI0100015,"\h(«Vyse»)Exactly.
Let's rest up today. We'll leave for Valua first
thing tomorrow morning.\e"
MFI0100000,"\h(«Vyse»)Bon…… nous avons le Cristal Mauve. Il ne nous
reste plus qu'à trouver le Jaune et l'Argent.\e"
MFI0100001,"\h(«Fina»)Les Anciens Silvite ont déjà le Cristal Argent
en leur possession.\e"
MFI0100002,"\h(«Fina»)Donc il faut simplement trouver le Cristal
Jaune.\e"
MFI0100003,\h(«Aika»)Notre mission est donc presque terminée.\e
MFI0100004,"\h(«Aika»)Mais attendez…… le Cristal Jaune se trouve dans
la Bouche des Tartas à Valua, n'est-ce pas ?\e"
MFI0100005,"\h(«Aika»)La dernière fois que nous y sommes allés, nous
n'avons pas pu rentrer car l'entrée était
bloquée.\e"
MFI0100006,"\h(«Enrique»)Oui, les Valuans ont tenté plusieurs fois de
dégager l'entrée mais sans succès……\e"
MFI0100007,"\h(«Enrique»)Mais, peut-être que nous pourrons contourner
l'entrée maintenant que le Delphinus a un
nouveau moteur.\e"
MFI0100008,\h(«Enrique»)D'après les géologues de l'Empire Valuan……\e
MFI0100009,"\h(«Enrique»)Les couches inférieures des Îles Valuan sont
couvertes de crevasses et de fissures.\e"
MFI0100010,"\h(«Enrique»)En d'autres termes, il y a tout un système de
tunnels souterrains sous Valua.\e"
MFI0100011,"\h(«Aika»)Donc il faut voler sous Valua pour trouver un
passage.\e"
MFI0100012,"\h(«Vyse»)Je vois……
Donc, en fait, si nous ne pouvons pas passer par
le haut, nous essayerons par le bas !\e"
MFI0100013,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous volerons sous Valua pour trouver un passage
sous l'île ! Une fois que nous serons dans les
tunnels, nous devrions pouvoir trouver le
Cristal.\e"
MFI0100014,"\h(«Aika»)Puisque nous avons la capacité de voler plus
haut et plus bas que jamais, autant en
profiter.\e"
MFI0100015,"\h(«Vyse»)Exactement.
Reposons-nous aujourd'hui. Nous partirons à
Valua dès demain matin.\e"
MGI0100000,"\h(«Vyse»)Also, ok…… jetzt haben wir den Purple Crystal.
Fehlen uns nur noch der gelbe und der silberne.\e"
MGI0100001,"\h(«Fina»)Die Elders der Silviter haben den
Silver Crystal bereits.\e"
MGI0100002,"\h(«Fina»)Also brauchen wir uns nur um den Yellow
Crystal zu kümmern.\e"
MGI0100003,"\h(«Aika»)Sieht so aus, als wäre unsere Mission fast
beendet.\e"
MGI0100004,"\h(«Aika»)Warte mal…… war der Yellow Crystal nicht im
Maw of Tartas in Valua zu finden?\e"
MGI0100005,"\h(«Aika»)Das letzte Mal, als wir da waren, konnten wir
nicht hinein, weil der Eingang versiegelt war.\e"
MGI0100006,"\h(«Enrique»)Ja, die Valuaner haben ein paar erfolglose
Versuche unternommen, das Siegel zu entfernen……\e"
MGI0100007,"\h(«Enrique»)Aber vielleicht wird es uns gelingen, das
Siegel mit dem neuen Motor der Delphinus zu
umgehen.\e"
MGI0100008,\h(«Enrique»)Den Geologen des Valuan Empire zufolge……\e
MGI0100009,"\h(«Enrique»)…… sind die unteren Schichten der valuanischen
Inseln voller Risse und Spalten.\e"
MGI0100010,"\h(«Enrique»)Mit anderen Worten, es gibt ein ganzes System
von unterirdischen Tunneln, die sich durch
Valua ziehen.\e"
MGI0100011,"\h(«Aika»)Also brauchen wir nur unter Valua entlang
zu fliegen und nach einer Öffnung zu suchen.\e"
MGI0100012,"\h(«Vyse»)Verstehe……
Anders ausgedrückt, wenn wir von oben nicht
hineinkommen, dann probieren wir es von unten!\e"
MGI0100013,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir fliegen unterhalb von Valua entlang und
suchen nach einer Öffnung unter der Insel!
Wenn wir einmal in den Tunnels sind, sollten
wir auch den Kristall finden können.\e"
MGI0100014,"\h(«Aika»)Da wir jetzt in der Lage sind, höher oder
tiefer zu fliegen als je zuvor, können wir
auch davon Gebrauch machen.\e"
MGI0100015,"\h(«Vyse»)Genau.
Wir sollten uns für heute ausruhen. Wir
brechen gleich morgen früh nach Valua auf.\e"
MJ0010000,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey, long time no see!
Wow… you've got yourself a nice little base set
up here!\e"
MJ0010001,\h(«Vyse»)Gilder!\e
MJ0010002,"\h(«Gilder»)I heard that you sailed around the world! 
As always kid, it sounds like you've been trying
to get yourself into more trouble…\e"
MJ0010003,"\h(«Gilder»)I came here to hear all about your travels… 
that, and for a good meal.\e"
MJ0010004,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha… 
Good old Gilder… 
Pleasure before business…\e"
MSJ0010000,"\h(«Gilder»)¡Eh! ¡Cuánto tiempo!
Hombre…… ¡te has montado una base muy mona aquí!\e"
MSJ0010001,\h(«Vyse»)¡Gilder!\e
MSJ0010002,"\h(«Gilder»)¡He oído que has navegado alrededor del mundo!
Como de costumbre, chaval, has estado buscándote
problemas……\e"
MSJ0010003,"\h(«Gilder»)He venido para que me cuentes tus viajes con
pelos y señales……
y para conseguir una buena comida.\e"
MSJ0010004,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, ja……
El bueno de Gilder……
Siempre anteponiendo el placer al deber……\e"
MFJ0010000,"\h(«Gilder»)Hé, on ne s'est pas vus depuis longtemps !
Wow…… Tu as une jolie petite base, dis donc !\e"
MFJ0010001,\h(«Vyse»)Gilder !\e
MFJ0010002,"\h(«Gilder»)J'ai entendu dire que tu as fait le tour du
monde ! Comme toujours petit, on dirait que tu
as essayé de t'attirer des ennuis……\e"
MFJ0010003,"\h(«Gilder»)Je suis venu pour que tu me racontes toutes tes
histoires de voyage…… et aussi pour faire un bon
repas.\e"
MFJ0010004,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha……
Sacré Gilder……
Le plaisir avant tout……\e"
MGJ0010000,"\h(«Gilder»)He, lange nicht gesehen!
Wow…… ihr habt euch aber hier ein hübsches
kleines Hauptquartier eingerichtet!\e"
MGJ0010001,\h(«Vyse»)Gilder!\e
MGJ0010002,"\h(«Gilder»)Ich habe gehört, dass du um die Welt gesegelt
bist! Junge, du kriegst wohl nie genug -
nicht mal genug Schwierigkeiten……\e"
MGJ0010003,"\h(«Gilder»)Ich bin gekommen, um von deinen Reisen zu
hören…… und natürlich, um ein gutes Essen
zu bekommen.\e"
MGJ0010004,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha……
Immer noch der Alte, Gilder……
Erst das Vergnügen, dann die Arbeit……\e"
MJ0240000,"\h(«Gilder»)…so you went to Yafutoma and then on to the
Land of Ice, huh? Just listening to your stories
makes my adrenaline flow.\e"
MJ0240001,"\h(«Gilder»)And so in the end, you collected the 
five Moon Crystals… Nice work.\e"
MJ0240002,"\h(«Aika»)Yup, we got them all!\e"
MJ0240003,"\h(«Gilder»)And since all of them are together, I suppose 
that means Fina will be taking them with her 
when she heads home soon…\e"
MJ0240004,\h(«Fina»)…Yes.\e
MJ0240005,"\h(«Gilder»)Actually…
There was something that was bothering me from 
earlier…\e"
MJ0240006,"\h(«Gilder»)Fina… where exactly did you come from? I mean, 
where are you going home to?\e"
MJ0240007,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MJ0240008,\h(«Aika»)Fina?\e
MJ0240009,"\h(«Fina»)The place to which I must return…
The place where both Ramirez and I were born and
raised…\e"
MJ0240010,"\h(«Fina»)…is the Great Silver Shrine. It is in a place,
high above the sky… \e"
MJ0240011,\h(«Vyse»)The Great… Silver Shrine?\e
MJ0240012,"\h(«Fina»)Long ago, when the Rains of Destruction fell 
upon the lands, and most of the world's 
population was killed… All seemed lost…\e"
MJ0240013,"\h(«Fina»)The most powerful Silvite mages met at the 
Shrine. They combined their energy to send it 
into the sky… above the destruction.\e"
MJ0240014,"\h(«Fina»)They escaped the horrible fate that fell upon 
the rest of the world, by rising above the 
destruction.\e"
MJ0240015,"\h(«Fina»)Ever since then… from above… we have sworn to 
protect the people of this world from the same 
fate that our ancestors suffered.\e"
MJ0240016,"\h(«Fina»)That is the primary mission of the remaining 
Silvites.\e"
MJ0240017,"\h(«Fina»)The Great Silver Shrine is high above the 
clouds, where no ship can reach it…\e"
MJ0240018,"\h(«Fina»)I plan to take the Moon Crystals back to the 
Great Silver Shrine. So that no one will ever be
able to abuse their power again.\e"
MJ0240019,"\h(«Enrique»)But…
How are you going to get home?\e"
MJ0240020,"\h(«Fina»)If I can get back the ship that I came in, 
then I should be able to make it home.\e"
MJ0240021,"\h(«Fina»)But, when I was attacked by Valua, my ship sank
beneath the clouds… \e"
MJ0240022,"\h(«Vyse»)Yes, I remember… you're talking about that ship
you were flying when Alfonso attacked you.\e"
MJ0240023,"\h(«Enrique»)Hmm… it appears that we must find another way
of getting Fina home.\e"
MJ0240024,"\h(«Aika»)But…
If we find a way to get Fina back home…\e"
MJ0240025,"\h(«Aika»)…does that mean we'll have to say good-bye?
We'll never get to see her again…\e"
MJ0240026,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MJ0240027,"\h(«Fina»)Lately…
I sometimes find myself thinking…\e"
MJ0240028,"\h(«Fina»)…I started thinking, if I am unable to find a
way home…\e"
MJ0240029,"\h(«Fina»)…that I'll be able to stay here, with everyone.\e"
MJ0240030,"\h(«Fina»)Haha… I'm sorry… that's so silly of me.
My orders were to gather the Moon Crystals and
to return to the Great Silver Shrine with them…\e"
MJ0240031,\h(«Vyse»)…\e
MSJ0240000,"\h(«Gilder»)…… ¿Os habéis ido a Yafutoma y luego a las
Tierras de Hielo, eh? Sólo de oír vuestras
aventuras se me pone la carne de gallina.\e"
MSJ0240001,"\h(«Gilder»)Así que al final, habéis recogido los cinco
Cristales Lunares…… Buen trabajo.\e"
MSJ0240002,"\h(«Aika»)¡Pues sí, los tenemos todos!\e"
MSJ0240003,"\h(«Gilder»)Y puesto que ya los hemos reunido todos, Fina se
los tendrá que llevar cuando regrese a su hogar,
dentro de poco……\e"
MSJ0240004,\h(«Fina»)…… Sí.\e
MSJ0240005,"\h(«Gilder»)La verdad es que……
Hay algo que ardo en deseos de preguntarte desde
hace tiempo……\e"
MSJ0240006,"\h(«Gilder»)Fina…… ¿de dónde vienes exactamente?
Quiero decir, ¿dónde está tu hogar?\e"
MSJ0240007,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MSJ0240008,\h(«Aika»)¿Fina?\e
MSJ0240009,"\h(«Fina»)El lugar al que tengo que volver……
El lugar donde crecimos Ramírez y yo……\e"
MSJ0240010,"\h(«Fina»)…… es el Gran Relicario de Plata. Está en un
lugar en lo alto del cielo……\e"
MSJ0240011,\h(«Vyse»)¿El Gran…… Relicario de Plata?\e
MSJ0240012,"\h(«Fina»)Hace mucho tiempo, cuando cayeron las Lluvias
Destructoras y la mayoría de la población
mundial desapareció…… todo parecía perdido……\e"
MSJ0240013,"\h(«Fina»)Los magos Silvite más poderosos se reunieron en
el Templo y unieron sus fuerzas para elevarlo al
cielo…… y evitar su destrucción.\e"
MSJ0240014,"\h(«Fina»)Ellos evitaron la horrible hecatombe que se
ensañó con el resto del mundo, elevándolo por
encima de la destrucción.\e"
MSJ0240015,"\h(«Fina»)Desde entonces…… ahí arriba…… juramos proteger a
las gentes de este mundo para que no sufran el
mismo destino que nuestros antepasados.\e"
MSJ0240016,"\h(«Fina»)Ésa es la misión primordial de los Silvites que
hemos sobrevivido.\e"
MSJ0240017,"\h(«Fina»)El Gran Relicario de Plata está sobre las nubes,
donde ningún navío puede llegar……\e"
MSJ0240018,"\h(«Fina»)Mi plan es devolver los Cristales Lunares al
Gran Relicario de Plata para que nadie vuelva a
utilizar sus poderes con fines malvados.\e"
MSJ0240019,"\h(«Enrique»)Pero……
¿Cómo vas a regresar a tu hogar?\e"
MSJ0240020,"\h(«Fina»)Si puedo recuperar la nave en la que viajaba
cuando vine, podré regresar a casa.\e"
MSJ0240021,"\h(«Fina»)Pero, cuando me atacaron los Valuan, mi nave se
hundió por debajo de las nubes……\e"
MSJ0240022,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí, me acuerdo…… te refieres a ese navío en el
que ibas volando cuando te capturó Alfonso.\e"
MSJ0240023,"\h(«Enrique»)Mmm…… parece que tenemos que encontrar otra
forma de llevar a Fina a casa.\e"
MSJ0240024,"\h(«Aika»)Pero……
si encontramos la forma de llevar a Fina a
casa……\e"
MSJ0240025,"\h(«Aika»)…… ¿vamos a tener que separarnos de ella?
Nunca volveremos a verla……\e"
MSJ0240026,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MSJ0240027,"\h(«Fina»)Últimamente……
A veces me sorprendo a mí misma cuando pienso……\e"
MSJ0240028,"\h(«Fina»)…… empiezo a pensar en qué pasaría si no pudiera
volver a casa……\e"
MSJ0240029,\h(«Fina»)…… podría quedarme aquí con todos vosotros.\e
MSJ0240030,"\h(«Fina»)Ja, ja…… Perdonad…… Qué tonta soy.
Tenía órdenes de reunir los Cristales Lunares y
volver al Gran Relicario de Plata……\e"
MSJ0240031,\h(«Vyse»)……\e
MFJ0240000,"\h(«Gilder»)……Alors tu es allé à Yafutoma et après au pays
des Glaces, hein ? Cela me donne des montées
d'adrénaline rien que d'écouter tes histoires.\e"
MFJ0240001,"\h(«Gilder»)Et donc à la fin, tu as rassemblé les cinq
Cristaux…… Joli travail.\e"
MFJ0240002,"\h(«Aika»)Oui, on les a tous !\e"
MFJ0240003,"\h(«Gilder»)Et puisqu'il sont regroupés, je suppose
que cela veut dire que Fina retournera avec dans
son pays……\e"
MFJ0240004,\h(«Fina»)……Oui.\e
MFJ0240005,"\h(«Gilder»)En fait……
Il y a quelque chose qui me tracassait tout à
l'heure……\e"
MFJ0240006,"\h(«Gilder»)Fina…… d'où venez-vous exactement ?
Je veux dire, où repartez-vous ?\e"
MFJ0240007,\h(«Fina»)…………\e
MFJ0240008,\h(«Aika»)Fina ?\e
MFJ0240009,"\h(«Fina»)Là où je dois retourner……
Là où Ramirez et moi sont nés et avons été
élevés……\e"
MFJ0240010,"\h(«Fina»)……C'est le Grand Temple d'Argent. Il se trouve
bien haut dans le ciel……\e"
MFJ0240011,\h(«Vyse»)Le Grand…… Temple d'Argent ?\e
MFJ0240012,"\h(«Fina»)Il y a bien longtemps, quand les Pluies de
Destruction se mirent à tomber, et que la
majorité de la population est morte……
Tout semblait perdu……\e"
MFJ0240013,"\h(«Fina»)Les mages Silvites les plus puissants se
retrouvèrent au Temple. Ils rassemblèrent leur
énergie pour l'envoyer dans le ciel…… au dessus
de la destruction.\e"
MFJ0240014,"\h(«Fina»)Ils échappèrent au destin horrible du reste du
monde, en s'élevant au dessus de la
destruction.\e"
MFJ0240015,"\h(«Fina»)Depuis…… d'en haut…… nous avons juré de protéger
les habitants de ce monde pour qu'ils ne
subissent pas la même fin fatale que nos
ancêtres.\e"
MFJ0240016,"\h(«Fina»)C'est la mission principale des Silvites qui ont
survécu.\e"
MFJ0240017,"\h(«Fina»)Le Grand Temple d'Argent se trouve bien au
dessus des nuages, où nul navire ne peut voler……\e"
MFJ0240018,"\h(«Fina»)J'ai l'intention de rapporter les Cristaux de
Lune au Grand Temple d'Argent. Ainsi, jamais
personne ne pourra abuser de leur pouvoir.\e"
MFJ0240019,"\h(«Enrique»)Mais……
Comment-vas tu rentrer chez toi ?\e"
MFJ0240020,"\h(«Fina»)Si je peux récupérer le navire avec lequel je
suis venue, je devrais pouvoir repartir.\e"
MFJ0240021,"\h(«Fina»)Mais, quand j'ai été attaquée par Valua, mon
navire s'est enfoncé sous les nuages……\e"
MFJ0240022,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui, je me souviens…… tu parles de ce navire que
tu naviguais quand Alfonso t'a attaquée.\e"
MFJ0240023,"\h(«Enrique»)Humm…… il faut lui trouver un autre moyen de
rentrer.\e"
MFJ0240024,"\h(«Aika»)Mais……
Si nous trouvons un moyen de renvoyer Fina chez
elle……\e"
MFJ0240025,"\h(«Aika»)……est-ce que cela signifie que nous devons nous
dire au revoir ? Nous ne la reverrons jamais……\e"
MFJ0240026,\h(«Fina»)…………\e
MFJ0240027,"\h(«Fina»)Ces derniers temps……
J'ai beaucoup réfléchis……\e"
MFJ0240028,"\h(«Fina»)……J'ai réfléchis que si je ne retrouve pas un
moyen de rentrer……\e"
MFJ0240029,"\h(«Fina»)……je serai obligée de rester ici, avec tout le
monde.\e"
MFJ0240030,"\h(«Fina»)Haha…… désolée…… je suis bête.
J'ai reçu l'ordre de réunir les Cristaux de Lune
et de retourner au Grand Temple d'Argent……\e"
MFJ0240031,\h(«Vyse»)……\e
MGJ0240000,"\h(«Gilder»)…...Ihr seid nach Yafutoma und dann zum
Land of Ice gereist, wie? Ich krieg schon vom
bloßen Zuhören einen Adrenalin-Rausch.\e"
MGJ0240001,"\h(«Gilder»)Also habt ihr am Ende die fünf Moon Crystals
eingesammelt…… gute Arbeit.\e"
MGJ0240002,"\h(«Aika»)Jawoll, wir haben sie alle!\e"
MGJ0240003,"\h(«Gilder»)Und da sie nun alle beisammen sind, nimmt
Fina sie wahrscheinlich mit, wenn sie bald
zurück nach Hause fährt……\e"
MGJ0240004,\h(«Fina»)……Stimmt.\e
MGJ0240005,"\h(«Gilder»)Übrigens……
Da ist noch etwas, das mich schon seit langem
interessiert……\e"
MGJ0240006,"\h(«Gilder»)Fina…… wo genau stammst du her? Ich meine,
wohin gehst du, wenn du nach Hause gehst?\e"
MGJ0240007,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MGJ0240008,\h(«Aika»)Fina?\e
MGJ0240009,"\h(«Fina»)Der Ort, zu dem ich zurückkehren muss……
Der Ort, an dem Ramirez und ich geboren wurden
und aufgewachsen sind……\e"
MGJ0240010,"\h(«Fina»)……ist der Great Silver Shrine. Er steht an
einem Ort, hoch über dem Himmel……\e"
MGJ0240011,\h(«Vyse»)Der große…… silberne Schrein?\e
MGJ0240012,"\h(«Fina»)Vor langer Zeit, als die Rains of Destruction
auf das Land niederfielen und der Großteil
der Weltbevölkerung getötet wurde…… schien
alles verloren……\e"
MGJ0240013,"\h(«Fina»)Da trafen sich die mächtigsten Silviter-Magier
beim Schrein. Sie konzentrierten ihre gesamte
Energie, um ihn in den Himmel zu erheben……
hoch über die Zerstörung.\e"
MGJ0240014,"\h(«Fina»)Sie sind dem furchtbaren Schicksal entronnen,
das den Rest der Welt befiel, indem sie sich
über die Verwüstung erhoben.\e"
MGJ0240015,"\h(«Fina»)Damals…… haben wir von oben geschworen……
die Völker dieser Welt vor dem Schicksal zu
bewahren, das unsere Vorfahren traf.\e"
MGJ0240016,"\h(«Fina»)Das ist die wichtigste Mission der
verbleibenden Silviter.\e"
MGJ0240017,"\h(«Fina»)Der Great Silver Shrine ist hoch über den
Wolken, wo ihn kein Schiff erreichen kann……\e"
MGJ0240018,"\h(«Fina»)Ich habe vor, die Moon Crystals zurück zum
Great Silver Shrine zu bringen. Damit niemand
je wieder ihre Macht missbrauchen kann.\e"
MGJ0240019,"\h(«Enrique»)Aber……
Wie willst du denn nach Hause kommen?\e"
MGJ0240020,"\h(«Fina»)Wenn ich das Schiff wiederkriegen kann, mit
dem ich gekommen bin, sollte ich es
schaffen.\e"
MGJ0240021,"\h(«Fina»)Aber als ich von Valua angegriffen wurde,
sank mein Schiff unter die Wolkendecke……\e"
MGJ0240022,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, ich erinnere mich. Du sprachst von dem
Schiff, mit dem du geflogen bist, als du von
Alfonso angegriffen wurdest.\e"
MGJ0240023,"\h(«Enrique»)Hmm……  sieht so aus, als müssten wir eine
andere Möglichkeit finden, damit Fina nach
Hause kommt.\e"
MGJ0240024,"\h(«Aika»)Aber……
Wenn wir eine Möglichkeit fänden, Fina nach
Hause zu bringen……\e"
MGJ0240025,"\h(«Aika»)……würde das denn bedeuten, dass wir uns von
ihr verabschieden müssen…… und wir sie nie
wieder sehen werden……\e"
MGJ0240026,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MGJ0240027,"\h(«Fina»)Neuerdings……
…… ertappe ich mich bei dem Gedanken……\e"
MGJ0240028,\h(«Fina»)……wenn ich den Weg nach Hause nicht fände……\e
MGJ0240029,\h(«Fina»)……könnte ich mit euch allen hierbleiben.\e
MGJ0240030,"\h(«Fina»)Haha…… Tut mir leid…… wie dumm von mir.
Ich hatte den Befehl, die Moon Crystals
einzusammeln und mit ihnen zum Great Silver
Shrine zurückzukehren.\e"

MK0050000,\h(«Fina»)…Yes?\e
MK0050001,"\h(«Vyse»)It's me…
I came by to see if you're okay.\e"
MK0050002,\h(«Fina»)Oh… Vyse…\e
MK0050003,"\h(«Fina»)I'm sorry, but…
Could I just be alone for a while?\e"
MK0050004,\h(«Vyse»)Fina…\e
MK0050005,"\h(«What will you say?»)“I understand…”
“Everyone's worried about you…”\e"
MK0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)I understand if you still need to work things 
out.\e"
MK0050007,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina, everyone is worried about you. 
If there's anything we can do to help…\e"
MK0050008,"\h(«Fina»)…I know… but, I… I need to sort out a few
things before I can… talk to anyone.\e"
MK0050009,"\h(«Fina»)I'm sorry to have worried you…
But, please… I need just a little more time to 
myself.\e"
MK0050010,\h(«Vyse»)… Okay.\e
MK0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)I'll be back later.
Fina… don't give up, okay?\e"
MK0050012,"\h(«Fina»)Elders…
Was Ramirez speaking the truth?\e"
MK0050013,"\h(«Fina»)What…
What am I supposed to do?
Who am I supposed to believe?\e"
MK0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Alright everyone!
Lift on three, okay?\e"
MK0050015,"\h(«Izmael»)As soon as we get this rubble out of the way, 
we can start building again! I can't wait…\e"
MK0050016,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey! I'm a guest here!!
Why… why am I stuck…
doing this kind of… work?!\e"
MK0050017,\h(«Aika»)Aww… quit… your… griping! \e
MK0050018,\h(«Marco»)This reminds me of Lower City… \e
MK0050019,"\h(«Clara»)What are you talking about?
Everyone is safe! We should be happy that nobody
was seriously hurt… \e"
MK0050020,"\h(«Brabham»)Nothin' lasts forever… that's why we build new 
stuff. In my prime, I would have rebuilt half of
the island already! \e"
MK0050021,"\h(«Lawrence»)They're too quick!
Somebody cast a spell or something!\e"
MK0050022,"\h(«Belle»)Ouch! 
I'm so tired… \e"
MK0050023,\h(«Fina»)Maybe my life is better now than it ever was… \e
MSK0050000,\h(«Fina»)…… ¿Sí?\e
MSK0050001,"\h(«Vyse»)Soy yo……
Vengo a ver qué tal estás.\e"
MSK0050002,\h(«Fina»)Oh…… Vyse……\e
MSK0050003,"\h(«Fina»)Perdona, pero……
¿Podría estar sola un rato?\e"
MSK0050004,\h(«Vyse»)Fina……\e
MSK0050005,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decir?»)“Claro que no, lo comprendo……”
“Estamos un poco preocupados por ti……”\e"
MSK0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)Lo entiendo, tienes muchas cosas en las que
pensar.\e"
MSK0050007,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina, estamos todos preocupados por ti.
Si te puedo ayudar en algo……\e"
MSK0050008,"\h(«Fina»)…… Ya sé…… pero yo…… necesito solucionar algunas
cosas antes de poder…… hablar sobre ello.\e"
MSK0050009,"\h(«Fina»)Siento que estés preocupado……
Pero, si no te importa…… necesito estar sola.\e"
MSK0050010,\h(«Vyse»)…… Vale.\e
MSK0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)Volveré más tarde.
Fina…… no te vas a rendir, ¿verdad?\e"
MSK0050012,"\h(«Fina»)Los Ancianos……
¿Estaba Ramírez diciendo la verdad?\e"
MSK0050013,"\h(«Fina»)Qué……
¿Qué voy a hacer ahora?
¿Quién dice la verdad y quién miente?\e"
MSK0050014,"\h(«Aika»)¡Muy bien, todos!
Hay que levantar a la de tres, ¿vale?\e"
MSK0050015,"\h(«Izmael»)En cuanto quitemos estos escombros de en medio,
¡empezamos a edificar otra vez!
Estoy impaciente……\e"
MSK0050016,"\h(«Gilder»)¡Oye! ¡¡Yo estoy aquí de invitado!!
Qué…… ¡¿por qué tengo que estar aquí con esta
clase de trabajo……?!\e"
MSK0050017,\h(«Aika»)Bah…… cierra…… la…… ¡déjalo ya!\e
MSK0050018,\h(«Marco»)Lo que me recuerda al Arrabal de Valua……\e
MSK0050019,"\h(«Clara»)¿Pero de qué estás hablando?
¡Aquí estamos todos a salvo! Deberíamos estar
contentos de que nadie fuera herido……\e"
MSK0050020,"\h(«Brabham»)No hay nada que dure eternamente…… por eso hay
que construir cosas nuevas. ¡Si fuera joven ya
habría reconstruido toda la isla!\e"
MSK0050021,"\h(«Lawrence»)¡Son demasiado rápidos!
¡Que alguien conjure un hechizo!\e"
MSK0050022,"\h(«Belle»)¡Aú!
Qué cansada estoy……\e"
MSK0050023,"\h(«Fina»)En cierto modo, nunca he sido tan feliz como
ahora……\e"
MFK0050000,\h(«Fina»)……Oui ?\e
MFK0050001,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est moi……
Je suis venu voir comment tu vas.\e"
MFK0050002,\h(«Fina»)Oh…… Vyse……\e
MFK0050003,"\h(«Fina»)Je suis désolée, mais……

MFK0050005,"\h(«Que direz-vous ?»)“Je comprends……”

Est-ce que nous pouvons faire quelque chose pour
toi……\e"
MFK0050008,"\h(«Fina»)……Je sais…… mais, j'ai…… j'ai besoin de mettre
au point plusieurs choses avant…… de pouvoir
vous parler.\e"
MFK0050009,"\h(«Fina»)Je suis désolée de vous avoir crée du souci……
Mais, s'il te plaît…… j'ai besoin de rester
encore un peu seule.\e"
MFK0050010,\h(«Vyse»)…… OK.\e
MFK0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)Je reviendrai plus tard.
Fina…… n'abandonne pas, OK ?\e"
MFK0050012,"\h(«Fina»)Anciens……
Est-ce que Ramirez disait la vérité ?\e"
MFK0050013,"\h(«Fina»)Quoi……
Que suis-je censée faire ?
Qui suis-je censée croire ?\e"
MFK0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Allez tout le monde !
On soulève à trois, OK ?\e"
MFK0050015,"\h(«Izmael»)Dès que nous aurons dégagé ces décombres,
nous pourrons commencer la reconstruction !
Il me tarde……\e"
MFK0050016,"\h(«Gilder»)Hé ! Je suis un invité ici !!
Pourquoi…… pourquoi est-ce que je dois……
faire ce genre de…… travail ?!\e"
MFK0050017,\h(«Aika»)Oh…… arrêtez…… de…… ronchonner !\e
MFK0050018,\h(«Marco»)Cela me rappelle le Bas Valua……\e
MFK0050019,"\h(«Clara»)Qu'est-ce que tu racontes ?
Tout le monde est sain et sauf ! Nous devrions
être contents qu'il n'y ait pas de blessés……\e"
MFK0050020,"\h(«Brabham»)Rien n'est éternel…… c'est pour cela que nous
construisons sans arrêt. Si j'étais jeune,
j'aurais déjà fini de reconstruire la moitié de
cette île !\e"

Quelqu'un a jeté un sort ou quoi !\e"
MFK0050022,"\h(«Belle»)Aïe !
Je suis fatiguée……\e"
MFK0050023,\h(«Fina»)Peut-être que ma vie n'a jamais été aussi bien……\e

Ich wollte nur nach dir sehen.\e"

MGK0050003,"\h(«Fina»)Es tut mir leid, aber……
Kann ich für eine Weile allein sein?\e"

Wenn wir dir irgendwie helfen können……\e"
MGK0050008,"\h(«Fina»)…… Ich weiß…… aber ich…… muss mir noch über
ein paar Dinge klar werden, bevor ich…… mit
jemandem reden kann.\e"
MGK0050009,"\h(«Fina»)Tut mir leid, dass ihr euch meinetwegen Sorgen
macht. Aber bitte…… ich brauche noch ein wenig
Zeit für mich allein.\e"
MGK0050010,\h(«Vyse»)……Okay.\e
MGK0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich komme später noch einmal vorbei.
Fina…… nicht den Kopf hängen lassen, ok?\e"

Warum…… warum bin ich dazu verurteilt,
diese Art von…… Arbeit zu verrichten?!\e"

Alle sind in Sicherheit! Wir sollten uns
freuen, dass niemand ernsthaft verletzt wurde!\e"
MGK0050020,"\h(«Brabham»)Nichts währt ein Leben lang…… deshalb bauen
wir immer wieder neu. Wenn ich noch jünger

Is he…?\e"
ML0030003,\h(«Moegi»)No… he… he can't be…\e
ML0030004,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, if we don't do something soon, Galcian
will destroy the world one island at a time.
We have to stop him.\e"

ML0030006,\h(«Aika»)How are we supposed to stop him?!\e
ML0030007,"\h(«Aika»)His base is an entire continent, and there's 
that shield around it… \e"

take on Galcian himself.\e"

not destroy it. Valua was just an example.\e"

allegiance from all of the other countries… \e"
ML0030023,"\h(«Belleza»)He will send his Armada to each of the countries
as a show of force, and demand that they
surrender. He will most likely go with them.\e"

have a shot at him.\e"

up, but we need to be realistic here.\e"

Galcian's entire fleet.\e"

That's more than enough reason for me to fight!\e"

We must fight together, for the future of this

I… I heard that something terrible

MFL0030001,"\h(«Vyse»)Moegi… I'm afraid… that… Galcian used the

MFL0030002,"\h(«Moegi»)What?!

Is he…?\e"
MFL0030003,\h(«Moegi»)No… he… he can't be…\e
MFL0030004,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, if we don't do something soon, Galcian
will destroy the world one island at a time.
We have to stop him.\e"
MFL0030005,\h(«Vyse»)I know… I'm working on it.\e
MFL0030006,\h(«Aika»)How are we supposed to stop him?!\e
MFL0030007,"\h(«Aika»)His base is an entire continent, and there's

It's alright, I'm okay.\e"
MFL0030016,\h(«Moegi»)I was so worried about you… \e

up, but we need to be realistic here.\e"
MFL0030026,"\h(«Gilder»)There's no way the Delphinus can take out
