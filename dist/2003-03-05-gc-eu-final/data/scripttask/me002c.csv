M00010000,"\h(«Jimmy»)Vyse, we took care of the island real good
while you were gone!\e"
M00010001,"\h(«Jimmy»)Aren't you proud of us? We did almost all this
by ourselves!\c"
M00010002,"\h(«Jimmy»)From now on, we're gonna help protect Pirate
Isle, too!\c"
M00010003,"\h(«Jimmy»)I'm so jealous of you, Vyse… I can't wait 'til
my dad let's me go sailing, too!\c"
M00010004,"\h(«Jimmy»)Hey, Vyse! Guess what? Guess what?
They let me on the Albatross the other day!\e"
M00010005,"\h(«Jimmy»)Well, actually, I was just helping my dad
move some boxes… hehe.\e"
M00010006,"\h(«Jimmy»)But, you gotta learn the little things like that
before you can become a sailor, right? I'm gonna
be the best sailor in the whole wide world!!\c"
M00010007,"\h(«Jimmy»)Is it really true that you sailed all the way
around the world, Vyse? It is?! Wow!!!\e"
M00010008,"\h(«Jimmy»)I'm gonna sail around the world, too, someday!
You just watch! I'm gonna be just like you
when I grow up!!\c"
M00010009,"\h(«Jimmy»)Wh, where'd that island come from?!
Where'd Shrine Island go?!
Vyse, what's going on?!\c"
M00010010,"\h(«Jimmy»)Actually, I wanted to go with you on your
journey, but my dad told me that I was too
young to be able to go out on my own yet.\e"
M00010011,"\h(«Jimmy»)So, I'll cheering for you guys from here, okay?
You better not let those bad guys beat you!!\c"
M00020000,"\h(«Alan»)While you were gone, I fixed a bunch of stuff
here on the island!\e"
M00020001,"\h(«Alan»)Heh… Now I feel like I can do anything!
Well… almost anything. Your mom helped
me move some boxes and stuff…\c"
M00020002,"\h(«Alan»)You know what? I actually had fun rebuilding
everything! It felt sorta good to make
something with my own hands!\e"
M00020003,"\h(«Alan»)Maybe I'll be a carpenter when I grow up!
I'm still a little young… but I guess it can't
hurt to dream, right Vyse!\c"
M00020004,"\h(«Alan»)Right now, all the grownups
are busy rebuilding the Albatross.\e"
M00020005,"\h(«Alan»)And you know what? I did such a good job helping
everyone rebuild the town that they're letting
me help rebuild the ship, too!\c"
M00020006,\h(«Alan»)Hey Vyse! Long time no see!\e
M00020007,"\h(«Alan»)You should come home more often! I want to hear
all about your adventures and stuff! I bet
you've seen some really neat stuff!\c"
M00020008,"\h(«Alan»)Really? There's a country called Yafutoma where
the houses are built right on the water?\e"
M00020009,"\h(«Alan»)Wow… I'd really like to try building something
like that! Of course… there isn't a whole lot
of water around here…\c"
M00020010,"\h(«Alan»)Vyse! There was this big roaring sound and that
island came up from inside the clouds and I was
so scared and I didn't know what to do!\c"
M00020011,"\h(«Alan»)Everybody's gone right now. They all sailed off
in the Albatross. But, I'm not scared anymore!\e"
M00020012,"\h(«Alan»)We'll be okay! We're going to defend the island
while all the grownups are off fighting! Just
leave everything to us, okay?\c"
M00030000,\h(«Lindsi»)Vyse! You're home! You made it back!!\e
M00030001,"\h(«Lindsi»)I missed you so much… I was so worried that you
wouldn't make it back…\c"
M00030002,"\h(«Lindsi»)Welcome home, Vyse! You should come back and
visit us more often, okay? We miss you!\c"
M00030003,"\h(«Lindsi»)Wow… That's a really nice ship, Vyse!
Where'd you get that thing from? You better
let me ride in it someday!\c"
M00030004,"\h(«Lindsi»)Alright, Pow… You better take good
care of Vyse, okay?\c"
M00030005,"\h(«Lindsi»)Really?! You sailed all the way
around the world?!\e"
M00030006,"\h(«Lindsi»)But, my mommy told me that there are scary
monsters at the edge of the world! Did any
of them try to hurt you?\c"
M00030007,"\h(«Lindsi»)Vyse… Jimmy told me that there are bad people
on that island… Is that true?\e"
M00030008,"\h(«Lindsi»)Whenever I think about that island at night…
I… I get scared and I can't go to sleep…\c"
M00030009,"\h(«Lindsi»)You better not let them beat you, Vyse! You
can't let the bad guys win!!\e"
M00030010,"\h(«Lindsi»)You better promise that you'll come home
safely, okay? Promise!!\c"
M00040000,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!\e
M00040001,"\h(«Vyse»)How are you doing there, little guy! You seem
happy enough to see us… Hehe… Have you been
taking care of everyone while I've been gone?\e"
M00040002,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow pow!!\c
M00040003,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!\c
M00040004,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!\c
M00040005,"\h(«Jimmy»)Umm… Vyse, we wanted to ask you to do
something for us…\e"
M00040006,"\h(«Jimmy»)We really wish we could go with you and help
out… but we're still too young, I guess. Well,
that's what our parents say…\e"
M00040007,"\h(«Jimmy»)So, instead, we want you to take Pow with you.
He'll help you out instead!\e"
M00040008,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!\c
M00040009,"\h(«Alan»)Pow has always been there for us… Whenever we
needed someone to cheer us up, he was there.\e"
M00040010,"\h(«Alan»)And we were just thinking that maybe if Pow
could go with you, he could cheer you up
whenever you needed it, you know?\e"
M00040011,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha… I see.
Well, then… Pow, looks like you're the newest
member of my crew!\e"
M00040012,"\h(«Lindsi»)You hear that, Pow? Vyse is going to take you
with him! You're going to get to sail on that
big ship with his crew!\e"
M00040013,\h(«Pow»)Pow! Pow pow!!\c
M00050000,"\h(«Martha»)Vyse… I just wanted to thank you for bringing
my husband home. I know that lazy bum couldn't
have saved himself even if he tried.\e"
M00050001,"\h(«Martha»)He may be a lazy bum… but… I still love him.
I realized that when he was gone. I missed him
so much… But you better not tell him that!!\c"
M00050002,"\h(«Martha»)Can you believe it?! That good-for-nothing
husband of mine is so ungrateful! Do you know
what he told me?!\e"
M00050003,"\h(«Martha»)“The women that I saw in Valua were some of the
most beautiful women I've ever seen…”
THAT'S what he said!!!\e"
M00050004,"\h(«Martha»)Here I was, worried sick about him… And all he
could do was admire the “beautiful women” in
Valua?! I can't believe him!!\c"
M00050005,"\h(«Martha»)Can you believe it?! That good-for-nothing
husband of mine is so ungrateful! Do you know
what he told me?!\e"
M00050006,"\h(«Martha»)“The whole time I was in Valua, I couldn't stop
thinking about sailing… I wanted to be out in
the sky. Oh, and I… uh… missed you, too…”\e"
M00050007,"\h(«Martha»)Can you believe him?! “Oh, and I… uh… missed
you, too…” Here I was, worried to death, and
all he could think about was sailing!!\c"
M00050008,"\h(«Martha»)Can you believe it?! That good-for-nothing
husband of mine is so ungrateful! Do you know
what he told me?!\e"
M00050009,"\h(«Martha»)“I really feel at home when I'm out sailing.
It's so relaxing… I have so much freedom…
Oh, but I don't mean anything by that…”\e"
M00050010,"\h(«Martha»)Can you believe him?! How could he NOT mean
anything by that?! I swear, I should lock him
inside the house from now on…\c"
M00050011,"\h(«Martha»)Can you believe it?! That good-for-nothing
husband of mine is so ungrateful! Do you know
what he told me?!\e"
M00050012,"\h(«Martha»)“My goal in life is to sail around the world
like Vyse and meet all kinds of beautiful women.
Oh, I mean, I think you're beautiful, too.”\e"
M00050013,"\h(«Martha»)Can you believe that he actually said that to
me?! I swear… one more comment like that, and
he's never going sailing again!!\c"
M00050014,"\h(«Martha»)Do you know what that good-for-nothing husband
of mine just told me? He looked off in the
distance at that new island and said…\e"
M00050015,"\h(«Martha»)“Don't worry, Martha. Even if it means my life,
I will protect you and the others from whatever
happens. This, I swear to you.”\e"
M00050016,"\h(«Martha»)I… I guess he really does love me. Sometimes I
really wonder, but… at times like this, I feel
more loved than anyone else in the world…\c"
M00050017,"\h(«Martha»)Do you know what that good-for-nothing husband
of mine just told me? Right before he sailed off
with the others, he turned to me and said…\e"
M00050018,"\h(«Martha»)“Don't worry… I'll be home before you know it.
And when I come back, I'm going to be a hero! So
make sure and fix a feast for my return!!”\e"
M00050019,"\h(«Martha»)I don't know… Maybe he just doesn't know how to
word things right. I guess that's just how he
shows his love.\c"
M00060000,"\h(«Barbara»)Welcome home, Vyse. I hear that you caused quite
the commotion over in Valua. Haha… Your father
must be quite proud of you.\e"
M00060001,"\h(«Barbara»)Don't tell her I told you this, but your mother
was worried sick about you while you were gone.
She was so happy that you came home safely.\c"
M00060002,"\h(«Barbara»)So how does it feel to have gone on your
first adventure? It must feel great to
be out on your own…\e"
M00060003,"\h(«Barbara»)But, I always knew that you weren't the type
to sit still for very long. I knew it was only a
matter of time before you left here.\c"
M00060004,"\h(«Barbara»)All the men have been busy with preparations
for battle ever since that strange island
appeared over by Shrine Island.\e"
M00060005,"\h(«Barbara»)I hope they know what they're doing… I get a
bad feeling every time I look at that island…\c"
M00060006,"\h(«Barbara»)Is it true? Was Valua wiped out by the Rains of
Destruction?\e"
M00060007,"\h(«Barbara»)That's horrible… I'm sure that not all Valuans
were bad people… I can't bear to think of all
the innocent lives lost…\e"
M00060008,"\h(«Barbara»)Vyse! You can't let them get away with
this! Show them that they can't mess
with the Blue Rogues!\c"
M00070000,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)You know, for a while there, I was actually
beginning to think that I'd never live to see
this place again.\e"
M00070001,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)I owe you one, Vyse. Looks like I'll be
able to go on being an Air Pirate for
a little while longer.\c"
M00070002,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Unlike in Valua, there's always such a nice
breeze blowing on Pirate Isle. Ahhh!\c"
M00070003,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Go take a look in the underground harbor.
The new Albatross II is being constructed
right now.\e"
M00070004,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)It's about 90% finished. It won't be long before
it's ready for its maiden voyage. I can't wait
to go sailing again!!\c"
M00070005,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Hey there, Vyse! I heard that you not only
managed to escape from Valua again, but you
stole one of their best ships as well?\e"
M00070006,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)That's incredible! But we've got a new ship,
too! We just finished the last preparations
on the Albatross II!\e"
M00070007,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)We've been working on it for a long time in the
underground port, and it's finally finished! I
can't wait to take her sailing!!\c"
M00070008,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Hey there, Vyse! How've you been? The new
Albatross flies like the wind… hehe.\e"
M00070009,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)What?! You sailed around the world?! Y, you mean
that the world isn't flat?! Man… You really are
something, Vyse. I'm impressed…\c"
M00080000,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Oh! You're home! Did you want to rest for a
little while?\c"
M00080001,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Sure, I could use a little rest.”
“Nah… I'll be fine. I'm not that tired.”\e"
M00080002,"\h(«Vyse»)Sure, I could use a little rest.\e"
M00080003,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Great! I'll prepare a nice dinner for you,
okay? Just go upstairs and relax… I'll let you
know when dinner's ready.\c"
M00080004,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Good morning! You just be careful out
there, okay? And make sure you bundle
up if it gets cold!\c"
M00080005,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Good morning! You just be careful out
there, okay? I pray that the Moons will
watch over you…\c"
M00080006,"\h(«Vyse»)Sorry, Mom… but not tonight. I'll stay some
other time, okay?\e"
M00080007,"\h(«Vyse's Mother»)Really? Well, alright. But, just remember that
you're always welcome to stay whenever you
want, okay? Be careful out there!\c"
M00090000,"\h(«Jessica»)I owe you so much, Vyse. You actually brought
my husband home safely. I… I can't believe it.\e"
M00090001,"\h(«Jessica»)But, just between you and me, I still haven't
finished that scarf that I was knitting. I
have to hurry up and finish it up!\c"
M00090002,"\h(«Jessica»)I finally finished that scarf that I was working
on, but I didn't like the color, so I'm starting
over from scratch. \e"
M00090003,"\h(«Jessica»)I know it's really my own fault, but I'm
starting to wonder when I'm ever going to
finish the thing…\c"
M00090004,"\h(«Jessica»)Oh hey, Vyse. I finished that scarf I was
working on, finally. What am I stitching
now, you ask?\e"
M00090005,"\h(«Jessica»)Well, to tell you the truth…
I'm having a baby!!!\e"
M00090006,"\h(«Jessica»)So now I'm knitting clothes for the baby.
Oh, I can't wait to see my baby wearing the
clothes that I make!\c"
M00090007,"\h(«Jessica»)It sounded like something terrible was happening
outside! There was a big blast of wind… Then
a rumbling sound… I don't know what to do…\c"
M00090008,"\h(«Jessica»)My husband went off to join the fight. He said
it was important for him to fight for our unborn
baby… He's so sweet…\e"
M00090009,"\h(«Jessica»)So, I will stay here and pray that he will
come home safely after the battle is won.\c"
M00100000,"\h(«Granny»)They say there are six Moons in this world:
Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, and Silver.\e"
M00100001,"\h(«Granny»)Remember to pray to each of them before you
start on your next journey. It is always best
to be in favor of all the Moons…\c"
M00100002,"\h(«Granny»)It is said that many, many years ago, there was
a great civilization that once flourished among
the clouds.\e"
M00100003,"\h(«Granny»)The people achieved wonders in technology and
had an advanced culture like no other. However,
they grew proud and spiteful of others.\e"
M00100004,"\h(«Granny»)As punishment, the Moons cast the whole
civilization down beneath the clouds into Deep
Sky, never to be seen again.\c"
M00100005,"\h(«Granny»)I… I never thought that the legend of the lost
civilization was true, but it… it appears that
I was wrong… Moons, help us…\c"
M00100006,"\h(«Granny»)It seems like yesterday that you were but a
little baby, crying in your mother's arms…\e"
M00100007,"\h(«Granny»)But now, you stand here before me, a fully grown
man. Go, Vyse… Go and fulfill your destiny. I
will be here praying for you…\c"
M00110000,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)During battle, your enemies can do more than
physical damage to your party. If you want, I
can teach you about these adverse effects.\e"
M00110001,"\h(«What would you like to learn about?»)“Ask about Sleep, Confuse, and Silence.”
“Ask about Poison, Fatigue, and Stone.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M00110002,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)If an enemy puts you to “Sleep,” you will be
unable to take any further actions until either
the effect wears off or you are hit.\e"
M00110003,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)But, the length of time you will be asleep will
vary. Sometimes you will wake up right away, and
other times it might take a while.\c"
M00110004,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)“Confuse” refers to a state where you can no
longer distinguish between friend and foe and
you strike out at the nearest target.\e"
M00110005,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)If a character with high attack power is
confused, it can be disastrous for the entire
party. You need to be especially careful, Vyse.\e"
M00110006,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)“Silence” is a very bad condition to be in. It
prevents you from being able to cast any magic
spells until you are cured of it.\e"
M00110007,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)At that point, you'll really need to watch your
health. Since you won't be able to cast any
healing spells, you'll have to use items.\e"
M00110008,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)If you or any of your party members is ever
“Poisoned,” then you'll steadily take damage
throughout the battle.\e"
M00110009,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)The longer the battle drags on, the more damage
you will take. So, if it looks like it's going
to be a long battle, you should cure yourself.\e"
M00110010,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)If one of you is ever in a state of “Fatigue,”
then you will be unable to recover any of your
Spirit Points.\e"
M00110011,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)Without Spirit, it's impossible to cast magic or
other special techniques. This is probably not
something you want to happen to you.\e"
M00110012,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)And then there's “Stone.” When this happens,
your entire body is turned to stone and you
will be unable to move.\e"
M00110013,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)You'll be stuck like that for several turns. The
only other way to cure the condition is through
magic or by using certain items.\e"
M00110014,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)Really? Alright, then. I guess you'll just have
to learn by experiencing them firsthand!!
Hahaha!!\e"
M00110015,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)Oh yeah, one more thing. Once the battle is
over, any impairments that you were suffering
from will disappear immediately.\e"
M00110016,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)So don't bother trying to cure yourself after
the battles are done. You'll just be wasting
your time.\c"
M00110017,"\h(«Timmus the Gunner»)It sounds like trouble's brewing…
Heh… I've been aching for some action!
I say, “Bring it on!!”\c"
M00120000,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Hey Vyse, did you know that there are six
different colors of Magic? I could teach you
them if you want…\e"
M00120001,"\h(«What would you like to learn about?»)“Ask about Green, Red, and Purple spells.”
“Ask about Blue, Yellow, and Silver spells.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M00120002,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Green Magic uses the powers of nature to heal
the recipient's body. The “Sacri” line of spells
are all healing spells.\e"
M00120003,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)However, there is also the “Noxi” line of Green
spells that use the powers of nature to poison
your enemy.\e"
M00120004,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Red spells are fire-based spells. The “Pyri”
line of spells will consume all enemies in sight
with intense flames.\e"
M00120005,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)There is also the “Increm” line of spells that
will intensify the recipient's fighting skills,
increasing their attack power and defense.\e"
M00120006,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)I don't know too much about Purple spells, but I
understand there is a line of ice spells called
“Crystali.”\e"
M00120007,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)I've also heard rumors of a Purple spell that 
has the power to affect the mind of its target.\c"
M00120008,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)I don't know too much about the Blue spells…
Rumor has it that they include spells that slow
your enemy down or put him to sleep…\e"
M00120009,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Also, I have heard that there are spells called
“Wevli” that can summon a small vortex to damage
a small group of enemies…\e"
M00120010,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)The Yellow spells are lightning spells. One
useful group of spells is “Electri.” It attacks
all enemies in a straight line.\e"
M00120011,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)There's also one called Driln that reduces
your enemy's Agile as well as all of his
other combat abilities.\e"
M00120012,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)And finally, there're the Silver spells…
Very few people have studied these spells,
so there isn't much known about them.\e"
M00120013,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)But, what I do know is that there is
supposedly a spell that can cure any
kind of physical ailment…\e"
M00120014,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)And I've heard there's a spell to revive someone
who has been knocked unconscious, as well as one
that can actually kill your enemy instantly…\c"
M00120015,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)Well, aren't we a little confident. Heh… That's
okay, though. But if you think of any questions,
don't be too proud to ask, okay?\c"
M00120016,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)I've taught you everything that I know, Vyse.
There isn't much more that you can learn from
me now.\e"
M00120017,"\h(«Borris the Gunner»)You know enough to keep yourself alive out in
the skies. Use that knowledge wisely!\c"
M00190000,"\h(«Patch the Deckhand»)I owe everything to you guys. If it wasn't for
your bravery, none of us would have ever made
it home to Pirate Isle.\e"
M00190001,"\h(«Patch the Deckhand»)I just wanted to let you know that… I'm
grateful. Your father raised you well, Vyse.\c"
M00190002,"\h(«Patch the Deckhand»)You can count on me to keep a sharp lookout!
I may only be a deckhand, but Ben tells me that
I'm a great lookout, too!\e"
M00190003,"\h(«Patch the Deckhand»)I've got a precious little wife to protect. No
way am I going to let the Valuans attack this
island again.\c"
M00190004,"\h(«Patch the Deckhand»)I was standing on watch like always, when
suddenly the wind started picking up rapidly
and nearly blew me off Lookout Island!\e"
M00190005,"\h(«Patch the Deckhand»)And then these huge clumps of land started
rising up one after another from beneath the
clouds, and they turned into that huge island!\c"
MF00010000,"\h(«Jimmy»)Vyse, nous nous sommes bien occupés de l'île
pendant ton absence !\e"
MF00010001,"\h(«Jimmy»)Es-tu fier de nous ? Nous avons fait tout cela
presque tout seuls !\c"
MF00010002,"\h(«Jimmy»)À partir d'aujourd'hui, nous aussi nous aiderons
à protéger l'Île des Pirates !\c"
MF00010003,"\h(«Jimmy»)Je t'envie vraiment, Vyse…… Il me tarde que mon
père me laisse naviguer moi aussi !\c"
MF00010004,"\h(«Jimmy»)Hé, Vyse ! Devine ! Devine ! Ils m'ont laissé
monter à bord de l'Albatros l'autre jour !\e"
MF00010005,"\h(«Jimmy»)Euh, en fait, j'aidais juste mon père à
transporter des caisses…… hihi.\e"
MF00010006,"\h(«Jimmy»)Mais, il faut apprendre à faire ces petites
corvées avant de devenir marin, n'est-ce pas ?
Je vais devenir le meilleur marin du monde !!\c"
MF00010007,"\h(«Jimmy»)Est-ce que c'est vrai que tu as fait le tour du
monde en navire, Vyse ? C'est vrai ?! Oaouh !!!\e"
MF00010008,"\h(«Jimmy»)Je vais faire le tour du monde en navire, moi
aussi, un jour ! Tu verras ! Je serai comme toi
quand je serai grand !!\c"
MF00010009,"\h(«Jimmy»)D'où vient cette île ?!
Où est passée l'Île du Temple ?!
Vyse, que se passe t-il ?!\c"
MF00010010,"\h(«Jimmy»)En fait, je voulais t'accompagner pendant ton
voyage, mais mon père m'a dit que j'étais encore
trop jeune pour partir tout seul.\e"
MF00010011,"\h(«Jimmy»)Alors je vous encouragerai d'ici, OK ?
Ne vous laissez pas faire par ces méchants !!\c"
MF00020000,"\h(«Alan»)Pendant ton absence, j'ai réparé des trucs sur
l'île !\e"
MF00020001,"\h(«Alan»)Je me sens capable de tout faire maintenant !
Euh…… presque tout. Ta mère m'a aidé à déplacer
des caisses……\c"
MF00020002,"\h(«Alan»)Tu sais quoi ? En fait, je me suis bien amusé à
tout reconstruire ! J'ai bien aimé travailler de
mes mains !\e"
MF00020003,"\h(«Alan»)Je serai peut-être charpentier plus tard !
Je suis encore un peu jeune…… mais cela ne coûte
rien de rêver, hein Vyse !\c"
MF00020004,"\h(«Alan»)En ce moment, tous les adultes sont en train de
reconstruire l'Albatros.\e"
MF00020005,"\h(«Alan»)Et tu sais quoi ? Comme j'ai bien aidé tout le
monde à reconstruire la ville, ils me permettent
aussi de les aider à reconstruire le navire !\c"
MF00020006,\h(«Alan»)Hé Vyse ! Je ne t'ai pas vu depuis longtemps !\e
MF00020007,"\h(«Alan»)Tu devrais passer plus souvent ! Je veux que tu
me racontes toutes tes aventures ! Je parie que
tu as vu des choses incroyables !\c"
MF00020008,"\h(«Alan»)Vraiment ? Il existe un pays qui s'appelle
Yafutoma où les maisons sont construites sur
l'eau ?\e"
MF00020009,"\h(«Alan»)Oaouh…… J'aimerais bien construire quelque chose
comme ça ! Bien sûr…… il n'y a pas beaucoup
d'eau ici……\c"
MF00020010,"\h(«Alan»)Vyse ! Il y a eu un grondement et cette île a
surgi des nuages et j'avais peur et je ne savais
pas quoi faire !\c"
MF00020011,"\h(«Alan»)Tout le monde est parti maintenant. Ils se sont
tous envolés sur l'Albatros. Mais, je n'ai plus
peur !\e"
MF00020012,"\h(«Alan»)Ça va aller ! Nous défendrons l'île pendant que
les grands se battent ! Laisse-nous faire, OK ?\c"
MF00030000,\h(«Lindsi»)Vyse ! Te revoilà ! Tu es revenu !!\e
MF00030001,"\h(«Lindsi»)Tu m'as tellement manqué…… J'avais tellement
peur que tu ne reviennes pas……\c"
MF00030002,"\h(«Lindsi»)Bienvenue, Vyse ! Tu devrais venir nous rendre
visite plus souvent, d'accord ?
Tu nous manques !\c"
MF00030003,"\h(«Lindsi»)Oaouh…… Ce navire est magnifique, Vyse !
Où l'as-tu trouvé ? T'as intérêt à me laisser
le naviguer un jour !\c"
MF00030004,"\h(«Lindsi»)OK, Pow…… Occupe-toi bien de Vyse, d'accord ?\c"
MF00030005,"\h(«Lindsi»)Vraiment ?! Tu as fait le tour du monde en
navire ?!\e"
MF00030006,"\h(«Lindsi»)Mais, ma maman m'a dit qu'il y avait des
monstres affreux au bout du monde ! Est-ce
qu'ils ont essayé de te faire du mal ?\c"
MF00030007,"\h(«Lindsi»)Vyse…… Jimmy m'a dit qu'il y a des gens méchants
sur cette île…… C'est vrai ?\e"
MF00030008,"\h(«Lindsi»)Quand je pense à cette île la nuit…… J'ai…… j'ai
peur et je n'arrive pas à m'endormir……\c"
MF00030009,"\h(«Lindsi»)Ne te laisse pas faire, Vyse !
Ne laisse pas les méchants gagner !!\e"
MF00030010,"\h(«Lindsi»)Promets-moi que tu rentreras sain et sauf,
d'accord ? Promis !!\c"
MF00040000,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow !\e
MF00040001,"\h(«Vyse»)Comment ça va, petit ! Tu as l'air content de
nous revoir…… Héhé…… Tu t'es bien occupé de tout
le monde pendant mon absence ?\e"
MF00040002,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow pow !!\c
MF00040003,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow !\c
MF00040004,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow !\c
MF00040005,"\h(«Jimmy»)Umm…… Vyse, nous voulions te demander un
service……\e"
MF00040006,"\h(«Jimmy»)On aimerait bien venir avec toi pour t'aider……
mais nous sommes encore trop jeunes, j'imagine.
Enfin, c'est ce que nos parents disent……\e"
MF00040007,"\h(«Jimmy»)Alors, à la place, nous voulons que tu emmènes
Pow. Il t'aidera !\e"
MF00040008,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow !\c
MF00040009,"\h(«Alan»)Pow a toujours été là pour nous…… Il a toujours
été là pour nous remonter le moral.\e"
MF00040010,"\h(«Alan»)Et nous pensions que si Pow t'accompagnait, il
pourrait te remonter le moral quand tu en aurais
besoin ?\e"
MF00040011,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha…… Je vois.
Bon…… Pow, c'est toi le tout dernier membre de
mon équipe !\e"
MF00040012,"\h(«Lindsi»)Tu entends ça, Pow ? Vyse va t'emmener avec
lui ! Tu vas naviguer à bord de ce gros navire
avec son équipage !\e"
MF00040013,\h(«Pow»)Pow ! Pow pow !!\c
MF00040014,"\h( )Pow a rejoint votre équipage, c'est une sorte de
“Bouffon.”……\c"
MF00050000,"\h(«Martha»)Vyse…… Je voulais te remercier pour avoir ramené
mon mari à la maison. Je sais que ce fainéant
n'aurait pas pu se sauver sans ton aide.\e"
MF00050001,"\h(«Martha»)C'est peut-être un fainéant…… mais…… je l'aime
encore. Je m'en suis rendue compte quand il est
parti. Il m'a tellement manqué…… Mais il vaut
mieux pas que tu le lui dises !!\c"
MF00050002,"\h(«Martha»)Tu le crois ?! Mon bon à rien de mari est
vraiment ingrat ! Tu sais ce qu'il m'a dit ?!\e"
MF00050003,"\h(«Martha»)“Les femmes de Valua sont les plus jolies femmes
que j'aie jamais vues……”
VOILÀ ce qu'il a dit !!!\e"
MF00050004,"\h(«Martha»)J'étais là, à me faire du mauvais sang…… Pendant
que monsieur admirait les “jolies femmes” de
Valua ?! Je n'arrive pas à le croire!!\c"
MF00050005,"\h(«Martha»)Tu le crois ?! Mon bon à rien de mari est
vraiment ingrat ! Tu sais ce qu'il m'a dit ?!\e"
MF00050006,"\h(«Martha»)“Pendant que j'étais à Valua, je n'arrêtais pas
de penser aux voyages…… Je voulais être dans le
ciel. Oh, et tu…… uh…… m'as manqué, aussi……”\e"
MF00050007,"\h(«Martha»)Tu le crois ??! “Oh, et tu…… uh…… m'as manqué,
aussi……” J'étais là, à mourir d'inquiétude, et
lui ne pensait qu'à naviguer !!\c"
MF00050008,"\h(«Martha»)Tu le crois ?! Mon bon à rien de mari est
vraiment ingrat ! Tu sais ce qu'il m'a dit ?!\e"
MF00050009,"\h(«Martha»)“Je suis vraiment dans mon élément quand je
navigue. Cela me détend…… Je me sens tellement
libre…… Oh, mais je n'insinue rien……”\e"
MF00050010,"\h(«Martha»)Tu le crois ?! Comment ne PAS insinuer quelque
chose en disant cela ?! Je te jure, je devrais
l'enfermer à clé dans la maison désormais……\c"
MF00050011,"\h(«Martha»)Tu le crois ?! Mon bon à rien de mari est
vraiment ingrat ! Tu sais ce qu'il m'a dit ?!\e"
MF00050012,"\h(«Martha»)“Mon but dans la vie, c'est de faire le tour du
monde en navire comme Vyse et de rencontrer
plein de jolies femmes, je veux dire, je te
trouve très belle aussi.”\e"
MF00050013,"\h(«Martha»)Je ne peux pas croire qu'il m'ait dit cela ?!
Je te jure…… une autre remarque de ce genre, et
il ne naviguera jamais plus !!\c"
MF00050014,"\h(«Martha»)Sais-tu ce que mon bon à rien de mari m'a dit ?
Il a regardé au loin en direction de cette
nouvelle île et m'a dit……\e"
MF00050015,"\h(«Martha»)“Ne t'inquiète pas, Martha. Même si cela me
coûte la vie, je te protégerai toi et les
autres, quoiqu'il arrive. Je te le jure.”\e"
MF00050016,"\h(«Martha»)J…… j'imagine qu'il m'aime vraiment. Parfois je
me demande vraiment, mais…… dans les moments
comme ça, je me sens la femme la plus aimée au
monde……\c"
MF00050017,"\h(«Martha»)Sais-tu ce que mon bon à rien de mari m'a dit ?
Juste avant de partir avec les autres, il s'est
tourné vers moi et m'a dit……\e"
MF00050018,"\h(«Martha»)“Ne t'inquiète pas…… Je serai très bientôt de
retour. Et je reviendrai en héros ! Alors
prépare un festin pour mon retour !!”\e"
MF00050019,"\h(«Martha»)Je ne sais pas…… Peut-être qu'il ne sait pas
bien s'exprimer. C'est sa façon à lui de montrer
qu'il m'aime.\c"
MF00060000,"\h(«Barbara»)Bienvenue, Vyse. On dit que tu as semé la
pagaille à Valua. Haha…… Ton père doit être
vraiment fier de toi.\e"
MF00060001,"\h(«Barbara»)Ne lui dis pas que je te l'ai dit, mais ta mère
était morte d'inquiétude à ton sujet.
Elle est tellement contente que tu sois revenu
sain et sauf.\c"
MF00060002,"\h(«Barbara»)Alors ? Qu'est-ce que cela fait d'avoir vécu ta
première aventure ?
Ce doit être formidable d'être tout seul……\e"
MF00060003,"\h(«Barbara»)Mais, j'ai toujours su que tu n'étais pas du
genre à rester sans rien faire. Je savais que tu
ne tarderais pas à partir.\c"
MF00060004,"\h(«Barbara»)Tous les hommes s'affairent aux préparations de
la bataille depuis que cette île étrange est
apparue au-dessus de l'Île du Temple.\e"
MF00060005,"\h(«Barbara»)J'espère qu'ils savent ce qu'ils font…… J'ai un
mauvais pressentiment chaque fois que je regarde
cette île……\c"
MF00060006,"\h(«Barbara»)C'est vrai ? Est-ce que Valua a été détruite par
les Pluies de la Destruction ?\e"
MF00060007,"\h(«Barbara»)C'est horrible…… Je suis sûre que tous les
Valuans n'étaient pas mauvais…… Je préfère
ne pas penser à tous ces innocents qui sont
morts……\e"
MF00060008,"\h(«Barbara»)Vyse ! Tu dois les faire payer ! Montre-leur qui
sont les Voleurs Bleus !\c"
MF00070000,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Tu sais, à un moment donné, j'ai commencé à
croire que je ne reverrais jamais cette île.\e"
MF00070001,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Je te redevrai cela, Vyse. Je vais pouvoir
continuer à jouer les Pirates de l'Air encore un
peu.\c"
MF00070002,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Il y a toujours une brise légère qui souffle sur
l'Île des Pirates, pas comme à Valua. Ahhh !\c"
MF00070003,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Va voir dans le port souterrain. Ils sont en
train de construire le nouvel Albatros II.\e"
MF00070004,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Il est presque fini. Il sera bientôt prêt pour
son premier voyage. Il me tarde de repartir
naviguer !!\c"
MF00070005,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Hé, Vyse ! On raconte que tu t'es encore échappé
de Valua, et qu'en plus tu as volé un de leurs
meilleurs navires !\e"
MF00070006,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)C'est incroyable ! Mais nous avons aussi un
nouveau navire ! Nous venons juste de terminer
les dernières préparations de l'Albatros II !\e"
MF00070007,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Nous travaillons dessus depuis un bout de temps
dans le port souterrain, et il est enfin
terminé ! Il me tarde de le mettre à l'eau !!\c"
MF00070008,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Hé, Vyse ! Comment vas-tu ? Le nouvel Albatros
vole comme le vent…… héhé.\e"
MF00070009,"\h(«Briggs le Vice Capitaine»)Quoi ?! Tu as fait le tour du monde en navire ?!
Tu veux dire que le monde n'est pas plat ?!
Oh…… Tu es vraiment unique, Vyse.
Tu m'impressionnes……\c"
MF00080000,"\h(«Mère de Vyse»)Oh ! Tu es de retour !
Tu voulais te reposer un peu ?\c"
MF00080001,"\h(«Que direz-vous ?»)“Une petite sieste me ferait du bien.”
“Non………… Ça ira. Je ne suis pas très fatigué.”\e"
MF00080002,\h(«Vyse»)Une petite sieste me ferait du bien.\e
MF00080003,"\h(«Mère de Vyse»)Bien ! Je vais te préparer à dîner, d'accord ?
Monte te reposer…… Je te préviendrai quand ce
sera prêt.\c"
MF00080004,"\h(«Mère de Vyse»)Bonjour ! Sois prudent là-bas, d'accord ?
Et couvre-toi bien s'il fait froid !\c"
MF00080005,"\h(«Mère de Vyse»)Bonjour ! Sois prudent là-bas, d'accord ?
Je prie pour que les Lunes te gardent……\c"
MF00080006,"\h(«Vyse»)Désolé, Maman…… mais pas ce soir. Je resterai
une autre fois, d'accord ?\e"
MF00080007,"\h(«Mère de Vyse»)C'est vrai ? Bon, d'accord. Mais, n'oublie pas
que tu es toujours le bienvenu. Sois prudent
là-bas !\c"
MF00090000,"\h(«Jessica»)Je te dois tellement, Vyse. Tu as ramené mon
mari sain et sauf. Je…… je n'arrive pas à le
croire.\e"
MF00090001,"\h(«Jessica»)Mais, pour tout te dire, je n'ai pas fini de
tricoter son écharpe. Je dois me dépêcher de la
finir !\c"
MF00090002,"\h(«Jessica»)J'ai enfin terminé de tricoter l'écharpe, mais
la couleur ne me plaisait pas, donc je
recommence à zéro.\e"
MF00090003,"\h(«Jessica»)Je sais que c'est ma faute, mais je commence à
me demander si je la finirai un jour……\c"
MF00090004,"\h(«Jessica»)Oh hé, Vyse. J'ai enfin terminé l'écharpe que je
tricotais. Tu veux savoir ce que je suis en
train de tricoter ?\e"
MF00090005,"\h(«Jessica»)Eh bien, à vrai dire……
Je suis enceinte !!!\e"
MF00090006,"\h(«Jessica»)Alors je tricote des vêtements pour le bébé.
Oh, il me tarde de le voir porter ces habits !\c"
MF00090007,"\h(«Jessica»)On aurait dit qu'il se passait quelque chose de
terrible dehors ! Il y a eu une énorme rafale de
vent…… Puis un grondement…… je ne sais pas quoi
faire……\c"
MF00090008,"\h(«Jessica»)Mon mari est parti se battre avec les autres.
Il a dit que c'était important qu'il se batte
pour notre nouveau né…… Il est si gentil……\e"
MF00090009,"\h(«Jessica»)Je vais rester ici et prier pour qu'il revienne
sain et sauf après la victoire.\c"
MF00100000,"\h(«Grand-mère»)On dit qu'il existe six Lunes dans ce monde:
Rouge, Jaune, Verte, Bleue, Mauve, et Argent.\e"
MF00100001,"\h(«Grand-mère»)N'oublie pas de prier pour elles avant ton
prochain voyage. Il vaut mieux être de leur
côté……\c"
MF00100002,"\h(«Grand-mère»)On raconte qu'il y a bien, bien longtemps, il
existait une civilisation extraordinaire qui
s'est développée au milieu des nuages.\e"
MF00100003,"\h(«Grand-mère»)Les habitants ont accompli des merveilles
technologiques et leur culture était extrêmement
en avance. Cependant, ils sont devenus fiers et
se sont mis à se mépriser.\e"
MF00100004,"\h(«Grand-mère»)Pour les punir, les Lunes ont envoyé leur
civilisation sous les nuages dans les
Profondeurs, et personne ne l'a jamais revue.\c"
MF00100005,"\h(«Grand-mère»)Je…… je n'ai jamais cru que la légende de la
civilisation perdue fût vraie, mais il…… il
semble que j'avais tort…… Lunes, aidez-nous……\c"
MF00100006,"\h(«Grand-mère»)Hier encore tu n'étais qu'un petit bébé, en
larmes dans les bras de sa maman……\e"
MF00100007,"\h(«Grand-mère»)Mais maintenant, tu es là devant moi, un homme
adulte. Va, Vyse…… Va remplir ta destinée.
Je prierai pour toi……\c"
MF00110000,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Lors des batailles, tes ennemis ne causent pas
que des dégâts physiques à ton équipe. Si tu
veux, je peux t'enseigner ces effets néfastes.\e"
MF00110001,"\h(«Que voudriez-vous qu'il vous apprenne ?»)“Le Sommeil, la Tromperie, et le Silence.”
“Le Poison, la Fatigue, et la Pierre.”
“Rien.”\e"
MF00110002,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Si un ennemi t'“Endort,” tu ne pourras plus
bouger jusqu'à ce que l'effet se dissipe ou que
tu sois touché.\e"
MF00110003,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Mais, ton sommeil durera plus ou moins
longtemps. Parfois tu te réveilleras tout de
suite, et parfois cela prendra du temps.\c"
MF00110004,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)“Tromperie” désigne un état qui t'empêche de
distinguer tes amis de tes ennemis donc tu tires
sur la cible la plus proche.\e"
MF00110005,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Si un personnage au pouvoir d'attaque élevé se
trompe, cela peut être catastrophique pour toute
l'équipe. Tu dois être très prudent, Vyse.\e"
MF00110006,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Il vaut mieux éviter de tomber dans le
“Silence”. Cela t'empêche de jeter des sorts
magiques jusqu'a ce que tu sois guéri.\e"
MF00110007,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)À ce niveau là, tu devras vraiment faire
attention à ta vie. Étant donné que tu ne
pourras pas jeter de sort de guérison, tu devras
te servir d'articles.\e"
MF00110008,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Si toi ou un des membres de ton équipe est
“Empoisonné,” tu subiras des dommages tout au
long de la bataille.\e"
MF00110009,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Plus la bataille durera, plus tu subiras de
dommages. Donc si la bataille s'annonce longue,
tu devrais te guérir.\e"
MF00110010,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Si l'un d'entre vous est en état de “Fatigue,”
tu ne pourras pas récupérer tes Points Esprit.\e"
MF00110011,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Sans Esprit, c'est impossible de faire de la
magie ou d'utiliser d'autres techniques. Tu ne
veux pas en arriver là.\e"
MF00110012,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Pour finir, il y a la “Pierre.” Dans ce cas,
tout ton corps se change en pierre et tu ne peux
plus bouger.\e"
MF00110013,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Cela durera plusieurs tours. Tu pourras guérir
grâce à la magie ou à d'autres articles.\e"
MF00110014,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)C'est vrai ? Bon d'accord. Tu apprendras sur le
tas alors !! Hahaha!!\e"
MF00110015,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Oh, encore une chose. À la fin de la bataille,
tous ces handicaps disparaîtront.\e"
MF00110016,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)Donc tu n'as pas besoin d'essayer de te guérir à
la fin d'une bataille. Tu perdrais ton temps.\c"
MF00110017,"\h(«Timmus le Canonnier»)On dirait qu'il va y avoir du grabuge……
Hé…… Il me tarde de passer à l'action !
“Venez me chercher !!”\c"
MF00120000,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Hé Vyse, savais-tu qu'il existait six
couleurs différentes de Magie ? Je pourrais te
les enseigner si tu veux……\e"
MF00120001,"\h(«Que voudriez-vous apprendre ?»)“Les sorts Mauve, Rouge, Vert.”
“Les sorts Argent, Jaune, Bleu.”
“Rien.”\e"
MF00120002,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)La Magie Verte se sert des pouvoirs de la nature
pour guérir son hôte. Tous les sorts “Sacri”
sont des sorts de guérison.\e"
MF00120003,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Cependant, il existe aussi tous les sorts Verts
“Noxi” qui se servent des pouvoirs de la nature
pour empoisonner tes ennemis.\e"
MF00120004,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Les sorts Rouges se servent du feu. Tous les
sorts “Pyri” consumeront les ennemis en vue dans
un incendie intense.\e"
MF00120005,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Il existe aussi tous les sorts “Increm” qui
intensifient les techniques de combat de son
hôte, en augmentant son pouvoir d'attaque et de
défense.\e"
MF00120006,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Je ne sais pas grand chose sur les sorts Mauves,
mais je sais qu'il existe une série de sorts
appelés “Crystali.”\e"
MF00120007,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)J'ai aussi entendu des rumeurs au sujet d'un
sort Mauve qui a le pouvoir d'affecter l'esprit
de sa cible.\c"
MF00120008,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Je ne sais pas grand chose sur les sorts Bleus……
D'après la rumeur, certains d'entre eux ont le
pouvoir de ralentir ou d'endormir l'ennemi……\e"
MF00120009,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)J'ai aussi entendu parler de sorts “Wevli” qui
peuvent invoquer un petit vortex pour endommager
un petit groupe d'ennemis……\e"
MF00120010,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Les sorts Jaunes sont les sorts Éclairs.
Les sorts “Electri” sont très utiles. Ils
attaquent tous les ennemis sur la même ligne.\e"
MF00120011,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Le sort Driln réduit l'Agilité de tes ennemis
ainsi que toutes ses techniques de combat.\e"
MF00120012,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Et pour finir, il existe les sorts Argents……
Très peu de gens ont étudié ces sorts,
donc on ne les connaît pas très bien.\e"
MF00120013,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Mais, par contre je sais qu'il existe soi-disant
un sort qui peut tout guérir……\e"
MF00120014,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Et j'ai entendu dire qu'il existe un sort qui
peut ranimer une personne inconsciente, et aussi
un qui peut tuer tes ennemis instantanément……\c"
MF00120015,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Oh, je vois que tu es sûr de toi.
Hé…… ce n'est pas grave. Mais si tu as des
questions, n'aie pas honte de demander, OK ?\c"
MF00120016,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Je t'ai appris tout ce que je savais, Vyse.
Tu n'as plus grand chose à apprendre de moi.\e"
MF00120017,"\h(«Borris le Canonnier»)Tu en sais assez pour survivre dans les cieux.
Sers-toi intelligemment de tes connaissances !\c"
MF00190000,"\h(«Patch le Matelot»)Je vous dois tout. Si tu n'avais pas été brave,
nul d'entre nous ne serait rentré sur l'Île des
Pirates.\e"
MF00190001,"\h(«Patch le Matelot»)Je voulais que tu saches…… que je te suis très
reconnaissant. Ton père t'a bien élevé, Vyse.\c"
MF00190002,"\h(«Patch le Matelot»)Tu peux compter sur moi pour assurer une bonne
surveillance ! Je ne suis peut-être qu'un
matelot, mais Ben dit que je fais aussi une très
bonne vigie !\e"
MF00190003,"\h(«Patch le Matelot»)Je dois protéger ma chère petite femme. Je ne
laisserai pas les Valuans attaquer cette île
encore une fois.\c"
MF00190004,"\h(«Patch le Matelot»)Je faisais le guet comme d'habitude, quand les
vents se sont mis à souffler et ils ont failli
m'emporter au large de l'Île Vigie !\e"
MF00190005,"\h(«Patch le Matelot»)Ensuite ces gros morceaux de terre sont apparus
de dessous les nuages, pour former cette île
gigantesque !\c"
MG00010000,"\h(«Jimmy»)Vyse, wir haben uns wirklich gut um die Insel
gekümmert, während du weg warst!\e"
MG00010001,"\h(«Jimmy»)Bist du nicht stolz auf uns? Das alles haben
wir fast allein gemacht!\c"
MG00010002,"\h(«Jimmy»)Von jetzt an werden wir auch dabei helfen,
Pirate Isle zu beschützen!\c"
MG00010003,"\h(«Jimmy»)Ich beneide dich wirklich, Vyse……  Ich kann's
nicht erwarten, bis mein Vater mich auch
zur See fahren lässt!\c"
MG00010004,"\h(«Jimmy»)Heh, Vyse! Weißt du was! Weißt du was! Neulich
durfte ich auf die Albatross!\e"
MG00010005,"\h(«Jimmy»)Also, in Wirklichkeit habe ich meinem Vater
dabei geholfen, ein paar Kisten zu stapeln……
hihi.\e"
MG00010006,"\h(«Jimmy»)Aber diese kleinen Dinge muss man wohl lernen,
bevor man Seeman wird, nicht? Ich werde der
beste Seemann auf der großen weiten Welt!!\c"
MG00010007,"\h(«Jimmy»)Ist es wirklich wahr, dass du um die ganze
Welt gereist bist, Vyse? Wirklich?! Wow!!!\e"
MG00010008,"\h(«Jimmy»)Ich werde eines Tages auch um die Welt segeln!
Warte es nur ab! Wenn ich groß bin, werde ich
genauso sein wie du!!\c"
MG00010009,"\h(«Jimmy»)Wo kommt denn diese Insel her?!
Wo ist Shrine Island hin?!
Vyse, was ist los?!\c"
MG00010010,"\h(«Jimmy»)Ich wollte eigentlich mit dir auf Reisen
gehen, aber mein Vater hat gesagt, dass ich
zu jung sei, um allein fortzugehen.\e"
MG00010011,"\h(«Jimmy»)Also werde ich euch von hier aus zujubeln, ok?
Lasst euch ja nicht von diesen Schurken
schlagen!!\c"
MG00020000,"\h(«Alan»)Während du weg warst, habe ich 'ne Menge
auf der Insel repariert!\e"
MG00020001,"\h(«Alan»)He…… Jetzt habe ich das Gefühl, ich kann alles!
Naja…… fast alles. Deine Mutter hat mir
geholfen, einige Kisten und so'n Zeug zu
tragen……\e"
MG00020002,"\h(«Alan»)Weißt du was? Es hat mir Spaß gemacht, alles
neu zu bauen! Es hat sich irgendwie gut
angefühlt, etwas mit den Händen zu machen!\e"
MG00020003,"\h(«Alan»)Vielleicht werde ich Zimmermann, wenn ich
groß bin! Ich bin noch etwas jung…… aber
man kann ja davon träumen, nicht wahr, Vyse?\c"
MG00020004,"\h(«Alan»)Im Moment sind alle Erwachsenen damit
beschäftigt, die Albatross wieder aufzubauen.\e"
MG00020005,"\h(«Alan»)Und weißt du was? Ich habe beim Neuaufbau der
Stadt so gute Arbeit geleistet, dass sie mich
jetzt auch mit am Schiff arbeiten lassen!\c"
MG00020006,"\h(«Alan»)He, Vyse! Lange nicht gesehen!\e"
MG00020007,"\h(«Alan»)Du solltest öfter nach Hause kommen! Ich
möchte von deinen Abenteuern hören und so!
Ich wette, du hast tolle Sachen erlebt!\c"
MG00020008,"\h(«Alan»)Wirklich? Es gibt ein Land Yafutoma, wo die
Häuser direkt auf dem Wasser gebaut sind?\e"
MG00020009,"\h(«Alan»)Wow…… Ich würde wirklich gern einmal versuchen,
so etwas zu bauen! Aber leider…… gibt es ja
hier nicht viel Wasser……\c"
MG00020010,"\h(«Alan»)Vyse! Da war plötzlich dieses donnernde
Geräusch, und diese Insel kam aus den
Wolken zum Vorschein. Ich hatte solche Angst,
ich wusste nicht, was ich machen sollte!\c"
MG00020011,"\h(«Alan»)Jetzt sind sie alle weg. Sie sind alle mit
der Albatross gesegelt. Aber ich habe keine
Angst mehr!\e"
MG00020012,"\h(«Alan»)Wir werden es schon machen! Wir werden die
Insel verteidigen, während alle Erwachsenen
beim Kampf sind! Überlasst einfach alles uns,
ok?\c"
MG00030000,\h(«Lindsi»)Vyse! Du bist zurück! Du hast es geschafft!!\e
MG00030001,"\h(«Lindsi»)Ich habe dich so vermisst…… Ich war so
besorgt, dass du es nicht schaffen würdest……\c"
MG00030002,"\h(«Lindsi»)Willkommen wieder zu Hause, Vyse! Du solltest
öfter zurückkommen und uns besuchen!
Wir vermissen dich!\c"
MG00030003,"\h(«Lindsi»)Wow…… Das ist ein wirklich schönes Schiff, Vyse!
Wo hast du dieses Ding her? Du musst mich
irgendwann mal mitfahren lassen!\c"
MG00030004,"\h(«Lindsi»)Also, Pow……  Pass schön auf Vyse auf, ja?\c"
MG00030005,"\h(«Lindsi»)Echt?! Du bist einmal um die ganze Welt
gesegelt?!\e"
MG00030006,"\h(«Lindsi»)Aber meine Mutti hat mir doch erzählt, es gäbe
fürchterliche Monster am Ende der Welt! Haben
sie versucht, dir wehzutun?\c"
MG00030007,"\h(«Lindsi»)Vyse…… Jimmy hat mir erzählt, es gäbe böse
Leute auf dieser Insel…… Stimmt das?\e"
MG00030008,"\h(«Lindsi»)Immer wenn ich nachts an diese Insel denke……
dann…… bekomme ich Angst, und ich kann nicht
einschlafen.\c"
MG00030009,"\h(«Lindsi»)Lass dich nicht von ihnen schlagen, Vyse! Du
kannst doch diese Halunken nicht gewinnen
lassen!!\e"
MG00030010,"\h(«Lindsi»)Dass du mir ja versprichst, heil nach Hause
zu kommen, ok? Versprich es!!\c"
MG00040000,\h(«Pow»)Pau pau!\e
MG00040001,"\h(«Vyse»)Was machst du denn hier, mein Kleiner! Du freust
dich wohl, uns zu sehen…… Hihi…… Hast du auch
auf alle aufgepasst, während wir weg waren?\e"
MG00040002,\h(«Pow»)Pau pau pau!!\c
MG00040003,\h(«Pow»)Pau pau!\c
MG00040004,\h(«Pow»)Pau pau!\c
MG00040005,"\h(«Jimmy»)Ähmm…… Vyse, wir wollten dich um etwas bitten……\e"
MG00040006,"\h(«Jimmy»)Wir möchten so gern mit dir kommen und dir
helfen…… aber schätze, wir sind noch zu jung
dazu. Das sagen jedenfalls unsere Eltern……\e"
MG00040007,"\h(«Jimmy»)Deshalb sollst du stattdessen Pow mitnehmen.
Er wird dir an unserer Stelle helfen!\e"
MG00040008,\h(«Pow»)Pau pau!\c
MG00040009,"\h(«Alan»)Pow war immer für uns da…… Immer, wenn wir
jemanden zum Aufmuntern brauchten, war er da.\e"
MG00040010,"\h(«Alan»)Also haben wir uns gedacht, wenn Pow vielleicht
mit dir gehen könnte, könnte er dich stets
aufmuntern, weißt du?\e"
MG00040011,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha…… verstehe.
Nun, denn…… Pow, sieht so aus, als wärst du
das neueste Mitglied meiner Crew!\e"
MG00040012,"\h(«Lindsi»)Hörst du, Pow? Vyse wird dich mitnehmen!
Du wirst auf diesem großen Schiff mit seiner
Crew mitfahren!\e"
MG00040013,\h(«Pow»)Pau! Pau pau!!\c
MG00040014,"\h( )Pow hat sich sozusagen als “Narr” zu
deiner Crew gesellt.\c"
MG00050000,"\h(«Martha»)Vyse……  ich wollte mich nur bei dir bedanken,
dass du meinen Mann zurück nach Hause gebracht
hast. Ich weiß, dass dieses faule Stück sich
nicht hätte allein helfen können.\e"
MG00050001,"\h(«Martha»)Er mag zwar faul sein…… aber…… ich liebe ihn
trotzdem. Das habe ich gemerkt, als er weg
war. Ich habe ihn so vermisst…… Aber das
brauchst du ihm nicht sagen!!\c"
MG00050002,"\h(«Martha»)Es ist nicht zu fassen! Mein Mann, dieser
Tunichtgut, ist so undankbar! Weißt du, was
er mir erzählt hat?!\e"
MG00050003,"\h(«Martha»)“Die Frauen in Valua waren die schönsten,
die ich je gesehen habe……”
DAS hat er gesagt!!!\e"
MG00050004,"\h(«Martha»)Ich saß hier und hab mir fürchterliche Sorgen
um ihn gemacht…… während er den “schönen Frauen”
in Valua hinterherguckt?! Ich kann's nicht
fassen!!\c"
MG00050005,"\h(«Martha»)Es ist nicht zu fassen! Mein Mann, dieser
Tunichtgut, ist so undankbar! Weißt du, was
er mir erzählt hat?!\e"
MG00050006,"\h(«Martha»)“Ich konnte die ganze Zeit in Valua nicht
aufhören, über die Seefahrt nachzudenken……
ich sollte oben am Himmel sein. Oh, und ich……
ähm…… habe dich auch vermisst……”\e"
MG00050007,"\h(«Martha»)Glaubst du das?! “Oh, und ich…… ähm…… habe dich
auch vermisst……” Ich saß hier und habe mir
fürchterliche Sorgen um ihn gemacht, und er
dachte nur an die Seefahrt!!\c"
MG00050008,"\h(«Martha»)Es ist nicht zu fassen! Mein Mann, dieser
Tunichtgut, ist so undankbar! Weiß du, was
er mir erzählt hat?!\e"
MG00050009,"\h(«Martha»)“Ich fühle mich wirklich in meinem Element,
wenn ich zur See fahre. Es ist so entspannend……
Ich habe solche Freiheit……  Oh, aber das soll
nichts heißen……”\e"
MG00050010,"\h(«Martha»)Glaubst du das?! Wie konnte das NICHTS heißen?!
Von nun an sollte ich ihn wohl zu Hause
einschließen.\c"
MG00050011,"\h(«Martha»)Es ist nicht zu fassen! Mein Mann, dieser
Tunichtgut, ist so undankbar! Weißt du, was
er mir erzählt hat?!\e"
MG00050012,"\h(«Martha»)“Mein Lebensziel ist es, wie Vyse um die ganze
Welt zu segeln und allerhand schöne Frauen zu
treffen. Oh, und ich finde dich natürlich auch
schön”.\e"
MG00050013,"\h(«Martha»)Ist das zu glauben, dass er mir das tatsächlich
gesagt hat?! Ich schwör's…… noch so ein
Kommentar, und er fährt nie mehr zur See!!\c"
MG00050014,"\h(«Martha»)Weißt du, was mein Mann, dieser Tunichtgut, mir
gerade gesagt hat? Er schaute in die Ferne zu
dieser neuen Insel und sagte……\e"
MG00050015,"\h(«Martha»)“Keine Sorge, Martha. Selbst wenn es mich mein
Leben kostet, werde ich dich und die anderen
vor allen Gefahren beschützen. Das schwöre ich
dir”.\e"
MG00050016,"\h(«Martha»)Ich…… ich nehme an, er liebt mich wirklich.
Manchmal frage ich mich wirklich, aber…… in
Zeiten wie diesen fühle ich mich mehr geliebt
als alle anderen auf der Welt……\c"
MG00050017,"\h(«Martha»)Weißt du, was mein Mann, dieser Tunichtgut,
gesagt hat? Kurz bevor er mit den anderen
abreiste, sagte er zu mir……\e"
MG00050018,"\h(«Martha»)“Keine Sorge…… ich bin zurück, bevor du dich
versiehst. Wenn ich komme, bin ich ein Held!
Kümmere dich um ein Fest für meine Rückkehr!!”\e"
MG00050019,"\h(«Martha»)Ich weiß nicht…… vielleicht weiß er einfach
nicht, wie er sich ausdrücken soll. Das ist
wohl ein Zeichen seiner Liebe.\c"
MG00060000,"\h(«Barbara»)Willkommen zu Hause, Vyse. Wie ich hörte, hast
du in Valua für ziemlich viel Aufregung
gesorgt. Haha…… dein Vater muss sehr stolz
auf dich sein.\e"
MG00060001,"\h(«Barbara»)Sag ihr nicht, dass ich es dir erzählt habe,
aber deine Mutter war ganz krank vor Sorge, als
du weg warst. Sie hat sich so gefreut, dass du
heil nach Hause gekommen bist.\c"
MG00060002,"\h(«Barbara»)Na, wie war denn dein erstes Abenteuer?
Es muss sich toll anfühlen, allein zur See
zu fahren……\e"
MG00060003,"\h(«Barbara»)Aber ich habe schon immer gewusst, dass du
nicht der Typ bist, der lange untätig
herumsitzt. Ich wusste, es war nur eine Frage
der Zeit, bevor du von hier weggehst.\c"
MG00060004,"\h(«Barbara»)Alle Männer sind mit Vorbereitungen zum Kampf
beschäftigt, seit diese seltsame Insel über
Shrine Island aufgetaucht ist.\e"
MG00060005,"\h(«Barbara»)Ich hoffe, sie wissen, was sie tun…… Ich
bekomme jedesmal ein schlechtes Gefühl, wenn
ich zu dieser Insel hinüberschaue…\c"
MG00060006,"\h(«Barbara»)Ist es wahr? Wurde Valua von den Rains of
Destruction ausgelöscht?\e"
MG00060007,"\h(«Barbara»)Das ist ja furchtbar…… Ich bin sicher, nicht
alle Valuaner waren schlecht…… Ich kann gar
nicht an all die unschuldigen Leben denken,
die dabei verloren gingen……\e"
MG00060008,"\h(«Barbara»)Vyse! Das darfst du nicht durchgehen lassen!
Zeig ihnen, dass sie sich nicht mit den Blue
Rogues anlegen können!\c"
MG00070000,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Weißt du, da draußen habe ich fast geglaubt,
dass ich diesen Ort niemals lebend wieder sehe.\e"
MG00070001,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Ich stehe in deiner Schuld, Vyse. Sieht fast
so aus, als könnte ich noch eine Weile
Luftpirat bleiben.\c"
MG00070002,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Im Gegensatz zu Valua weht auf Pirate Isle
immer so eine nette Brise. Ahhh!\c"
MG00070003,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Schau mal im Untergrundhafen vorbei. Die neue
Albatross II ist dort in Konstruktion.\e"
MG00070004,"\h(«Briggs the Vice Captain»)Sie ist zu 90% fertig. Sie wird bald für ihre
Jungfernfahrt fertig sein. Ich kann es gar nicht
erwarten, wieder segeln zu gehen!!\c"
MG00070005,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Hallo, Vyse! Ich höre, du bist nicht nur
wieder einmal aus Valua geflohen, du hast
auch eines ihrer besten Schiffe gestohlen, was?\e"
MG00070006,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Das ist unglaublich! Aber wir haben auch ein
neues Schiff! Wir haben gerade die letzten
Arbeiten an der Albatross II abgeschlossen!\e"
MG00070007,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Wir arbeiten schon lange an ihr im Untergrund-
Hafen, und jetzt ist sie endlich fertig! Ich
kann's nicht erwarten, mit ihr zu segeln!!\c"
MG00070008,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Hallo, Vyse! Wie geht's? Die neue
Albatross fliegt wie der Wind…… hihi.\e"
MG00070009,"\h(«Briggs, der Vizekapitän»)Was?! Du bist um die Welt gesegelt?! W……
willst du sagen, die Welt ist nicht flach?!
Mann, du hast was auf dem Kasten, Vyse. Ich bin
beeindruckt……\c"
MG00080000,"\h(«Vyses Mutter»)Ach, du bist wieder da! Wolltest du dich
ein bisschen ausruhen?\c"
MG00080001,"\h(«Was wirst du sagen?»)“Klar, ich könnte ein bisschen Ruhe vertragen”.
“Nö…… schon in Ordnung. So müde bin ich nicht”.\e"
MG00080002,"\h(«Vyse»)Klar, ich könnte ein bisschen Ruhe vertragen.\e"
MG00080003,"\h(«Vyses Mutter»)Wunderbar! Ich werde dir ein schönes
Abendessen machen, ja? Geh einfach hinauf
und entspann dich ein wenig. Ich ruf dich,
wenn das Essen fertig ist.\c"
MG00080004,"\h(«Vyses Mutter»)Guten Morgen! Du musst dort draußen vorsichtig
sein, ja? Und zieh dich ja warm an, wenn es kalt
wird!\c"
MG00080005,"\h(«Vyses Mutter»)Guten Morgen! Du musst dort draußen vorsichtig
sein, ja? Ich werde beten,
damit dich die Monde beschützen.\c"
MG00080006,"\h(«Vyse»)Tut mir Leid, Mama, aber heute Abend kann ich
nicht. Ich bleibe ein andermal, ok?\e"
MG00080007,"\h(«Vyses Mutter»)Wirklich? Na, in Ordnung. Aber denk dran,
du kannst immer hier übernachten, wenn du
willst, ok? Sei vorsichtig dort draußen!\c"
MG00090000,"\h(«Jessica»)Ich verdanke dir so viel, Vyse. Du hast meinen
Mann heil wiedergebracht. Ich…… ich kann's
nicht glauben.\e"
MG00090001,"\h(«Jessica»)Aber, unter uns, ich habe den Schal, den ich
gestrickt habe, noch nicht ganz fertig. Ich
muss mich jetzt beeilen, damit er fertig wird!\c"
MG00090002,"\h(«Jessica»)Ich habe den Schal, den ich gestrickt habe,
endlich fertig, aber mir gefällt die Farbe
nicht, also fange ich wieder von vorn an.\e"
MG00090003,"\h(«Jessica»)Ich weiß, es liegt an mir, aber ich frage mich
langsam, ob ich ihn je fertig kriegen werde……\e"
MG00090004,"\h(«Jessica»)Ach, hallo, Vyse. Ich habe endlich den Schal
fertig, an dem ich arbeitete. Du fragst, was
ich da jetzt mache?\e"
MG00090005,"\h(«Jessica»)Nun, um die Wahrheit zu sagen……
Ich bekomme ein Baby!!!\e"
MG00090006,"\h(«Jessica»)Jetzt stricke ich also Sachen fürs Baby.
Oh, ich kann's nicht erwarten, mein Baby in
den Kleidern zu sehen, die ich für es mache!\c"
MG00090007,"\h(«Jessica»)Es hörte sich an, als wäre draußen etwas
Furchtbares passiert! Es hat einen starken
Windstoß gegeben…… dann ein Donnern……
Ich weiß nicht, was ich machen soll……\c"
MG00090008,"\h(«Jessica»)Mein Mann hat sich dem Kampf angeschlossen.
Er sagte, es wäre ihm wichtig, für unser
ungeborenes Baby zu kämpfen…… Er ist wirklich
süß……\e"
MG00090009,"\h(«Jessica»)Also werde ich hier bleiben und beten, dass er
nach gewonnener Schlacht unversehrt
zurückkehrt.\c"
MG00100000,"\h(«Oma»)Man sagt, es gibt sechs Monde auf dieser Welt:
Rot, Gelb, Grün, Blau, Purpur und Silber.\e"
MG00100001,"\h(«Oma»)Man darf nicht vergessen, jeden von ihnen
anzubeten, bevor man sich auf die Reise begibt.
Es zahlt sich immer aus, in der Gunst der
Monde zu stehen……\c"
MG00100002,"\h(«Oma»)Man sagt, dass es vor vielen Jahren eine
hoch entwickelte Zivilisation gab, die zwischen
den Wolken groß wurde.\e"
MG00100003,"\h(«Oma»)Das Volk schuf wahre Wunder der Technologie
und hatte eine fortschrittliche Kultur wie kein
anderes. Aber es wurde stolz und boshaft
gegenüber den anderen.\e"
MG00100004,"\h(«Oma»)Zur Strafe warfen die Monde die gesamte
Zivilisation unter die Wolken in den Deep Sky,
wo sie nie wieder gesehen wurde.\c"
MG00100005,"\h(«Oma»)Ich…… ich hätte nie gedacht, dass die Legende
der verlorenen Zivilisation wahr ist, aber ich
hatte wohl Unrecht……  Oh Monde, helft uns……\c"
MG00100006,"\h(«Oma»)Mir ist, als wärst du gestern noch ein
kleines Baby gewesen, das in den Armen seiner
Mutter weint……\e"
MG00100007,"\h(«Oma»)Und jetzt stehst du als ausgewachsener Mann
vor mir. Geh, Vyse…… geh und erfülle dein
Schicksal. Ich werde hier sein und für dich
beten.\c"
MG00110000,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Während der Schlacht kann der Feind deiner
Gruppe mehr als nur physischen Schaden zufügen.
Wenn du willst, kann ich dir über diese
negativen Effekte erzählen.\e"
MG00110001,"\h(«Was möchtest du gerne lernen?»)“Frag nach Schlaf, Verwirrung und Stille”.
“Frag nach Gift, Ermüdung und Stein”.
“Nichts”.\e"
MG00110002,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Wenn dich ein Feind mit “Schlaf” belegt, kannst
du nichts weiter tun, bis der Effekt
verfliegt oder du getroffen wirst.\e"
MG00110003,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Aber die Zeitspanne, während der du schläfst,
ist unterschiedlich. Manchmal wachst du gleich
wieder auf, ein anderes Mal dauert es eine
Weile.\c"
MG00110004,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)“Verwirrung” bewirkt einen Zustand, in dem
du nicht mehr zwischen Freund und Feind
unterscheiden kannst und das nächstliegende
Ziel angreifst.\e"
MG00110005,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Ist eine Person mit hoher Angriffskraft
verwirrt, kann es für die gesamte Gruppe
verheerend sein. Du musst besonders vorsichtig
sein, Vyse.\e"
MG00110006,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)“Schlaf” ist ein sehr schlechter Zustand.
Er lässt nicht zu, dass du Zaubersprüche
aussprichst, bevor du geheilt bist.\e"
MG00110007,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)An dem Punkt musst du besonders auf deine
Gesundheit achten. Da du nicht in der Lage
bist, Heil-Zaubersprüche auszusprechen, musst
du Objekte verwenden.\e"
MG00110008,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Wirst du oder ein anderes Gruppenmitglied je
“vergiftet”, dann nimmst du während des
Kampfes mehr und mehr Schaden.\e"
MG00110009,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Je länger sich die Schlacht hinzieht, desto
mehr Schaden nimmst du. Wenn es also
so aussieht, als würde es eine lange Schlacht,
solltest du dich selbst heilen.\e"
MG00110010,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Befindet sich einer von euch je in einem
Zustand von “Fatigue”, könnt ihr
keinerlei Spirit Points wiedererlangen.\e"
MG00110011,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Ohne Spirit ist es nicht möglich, Zauber oder
andere speziellen Techniken zu benutzen.
Du willst sicher nicht, dass dir das passiert.\e"
MG00110012,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Und dann ist da noch “Stein”. Wenn das
passiert, verwandelt sich dein ganzer Körper
in Stein, und du kannst dich nicht mehr bewegen.\e"
MG00110013,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)So steckst du für einige Runden fest.
Die einzige Möglichkeit, diesem Zustand
abzuhelfen, ist durch Zauber oder durch den
Gebrauch bestimmter anderer Objekte.\e"
MG00110014,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Tatsächlich? Ist in Ordnung.  Dann wirst du
die Erfahrung wohl aus erster Hand machen
müssen!! Hahaha!!\e"
MG00110015,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Ach so, und noch etwas. Sobald die Schlacht
vorbei ist, gehen alle Behinderungen, unter
denen du gelitten hast, sofort weg.\e"
MG00110016,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Also brauchst du gar nicht erst versuchen,
dich nach dem Ende der Schlacht zu heilen.
Du verschwendest damit deine Zeit.\c"
MG00110017,"\h(«Timmus, der Kanonier»)Sieht so aus, als bekämen wir Ärger……
Heh…… mir ist nach ein wenig Action!
Also, nehmen wir es in Angriff!!\c"
MG00120000,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)He, Vyse, wusstest du, dass es sechs
verschiedene Farben von Magic gibt? Ich könnte
sie dir beibringen, wenn du willst……\e"
MG00120001,"\h(«Was möchtest du gerne lernen?»)“Frag nach grünem, rotem und purpur Zauber.”
“Frag nach blauem, gelbem und silbernem Zauber.”
“Nichts.”\e"
MG00120002,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Green Magic macht sich die Kraft der Natur zu
Eigen, um den Körper des Empfängers zu heilen.
Die “Sacri-” Zaubersprüche gehören alle zu den
Heilzaubern.\e"
MG00120003,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Es gibt jedoch auch die Reihe von “Noxi-”
grünen Zaubersprüchen, die die Kraft der Natur
verwenden, um den Feind zu vergiften.\e"
MG00120004,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Rote Zaubersprüche basieren auf dem Feuer.
Die “Pyri-” Zaubersprüche hüllen alle Feinde
in Sichtweite in lodernde Flammen.\e"
MG00120005,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Es gibt noch die “Increm-” Zauberspruchreihe,
die die Kampffähigkeit des Empfängers erhöht,
indem sie seine Angriffskraft und Verteidigung
stärkt.\e"
MG00120006,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Ich weiß nicht viel über purpur Zaubersprüche,
aber es soll eine Reihe von Eis-Zaubersprüchen
geben, die “Crystali” genannt werden.\e"
MG00120007,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Ich habe auch schon Gerüchte über purpur Zauber-
sprüche gehört, die die Macht besitzen, das
Gehirn der Zielperson zu beeinflussen.\c"
MG00120008,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Über die blauben Zaubersprüche weiß ich nicht
gut Bescheid…… Man sagt, dass sie den Feind
verlangsamen und ihn zum Einschlafen bringen……\e"
MG00120009,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Außerdem habe ich von “Wevli-” Zaubersprüchen
gehört, die einen kleinen Wirbelsturm
hervorrufen können, um eine kleine Feindgruppe
zu schädigen……\e"
MG00120010,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Die gelben Zaubersprüche sind für Blitze.
Eine nützliche Gruppe sind die “Electri”.
Sie greifen alle Feinde in einer geraden
Linie an.\e"
MG00120011,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Dann gibt es noch einen, der “Driln” genannt
wird; er reduziert die Beweglichkeit deines
Feindes sowie alle seine weiteren
Kampffähigkeiten.\e"
MG00120012,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Und zum Schluss sind da die silbernen
Zaubersprüche…… sehr wenig Leute haben sich
mit ihnen befasst, also ist nicht viel über
sie bekannt.\e"
MG00120013,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Was ich allerdings weiß, ist, dass es einen
Zauberspruch gibt, der jede Art von
physischem Leiden heilen kann……\e"
MG00120014,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Und ich habe gehört, dass es einen Zauberspruch
gibt, der dich wieder belebt, wenn du
bewusstlos bist, sowie einen, der deinen Feind
an Ort und Stelle töten kann……\c"
MG00120015,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Nun, wir sind uns unserer Sache wohl sehr
sicher…… He…… aber das macht nichts. Wenn
dir noch Fragen einfallen, dann frag nur, ok?\c"
MG00120016,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Ich habe dir alles gesagt, was ich weiß, Vyse.
Es gibt nicht viel mehr, was ich dir
jetzt noch beibringen kann.\e"
MG00120017,"\h(«Borris, der Kanonier»)Du weißt Bescheid, wie du dich dort draußen
im Himmel am Leben erhalten kannst. Benutz
dein Wissen mit Bedacht!\c"
MG00190000,"\h(«Patch, der Hilfsmatrose»)Ich verdanke euch alles. Wenn ihr nicht so
tapfer gewesen wärt, hätte es keiner von uns
je nach Pirate Isle zurück geschafft.\e"
MG00190001,"\h(«Patch, der Hilfsmatrose»)Ich wollte euch nur sagen, dass…… ich euch
dankbar bin. Dein Vater hat dich gut erzogen,
Vyse.\c"
MG00190002,"\h(«Patch, der Hilfsmatrose»)Ihr könnt euch auf mich verlassen, ich pass
gut auf! Ich bin zwar nur ein Hilfsmatrose, aber
Ben meint, ich wäre auch ein guter Wachtposten!\e"
MG00190003,"\h(«Patch, der Hilfsmatrose»)Ich muss meine süße kleine Frau beschützen.
Ich lasse auf keinen Fall zu, dass die Valuaner
diese Insel noch einmal angreifen.\c"
MG00190004,"\h(«Patch, der Hilfsmatrose»)Ich stand wie immer Wache, und plötzlich erhob
sich ein starker Wind, der mich fast von
Lookout Island gefegt hätte!\e"
MG00190005,"\h(«Patch, der Hilfsmatrose»)Und dann erschienen diese riesigen Klumpen
von Land einer nach dem anderen aus den Wolken
und verwandelten sich in eine riesige Insel!\c"
MS00010000,"\h(«Jimmy»)¡Vyse, nos hemos ocupado de la isla mientras tú
estabas fuera!\e"
MS00010001,"\h(«Jimmy»)¿Es que no estás orgulloso de nosotros?
¡Lo hicimos prácticamente solos!\c"
MS00010002,"\h(«Jimmy»)¡De ahora en adelante, también te vamos a ayudar
a proteger la Isla del Pirata!\c"
MS00010003,"\h(«Jimmy»)Me das una envidia, Vyse…… ¡Espero que mi padre
me de permiso para ir a navegar pronto!\c"
MS00010004,"\h(«Jimmy»)¡Oye, Vyse! Adivina. ¿Sabes qué?
¡El otro día me dejaron subir al Albatross!\e"
MS00010005,"\h(«Jimmy»)Bueno, la verdad es que estaba ayudando a mi
padre a mover unas cajas…… je, je.\e"
MS00010006,"\h(«Jimmy»)Pero para ser marino tienes que aprender primero
estas pequeñas cosas, ¿no? ¡¡Voy a ser el mejor
marino del mundo entero!!\c"
MS00010007,"\h(«Jimmy»)¿Es cierto que has navegado por todo el mundo,
Vyse? ¡¿Es verdad?! ¡Oh!\e"
MS00010008,"\h(«Jimmy»)¡Yo también voy a navegar por el mundo entero
algún día! ¡Fíjate en mí! ¡Cuando sea mayor, voy
a ser como tú!\c"
MS00010009,"\h(«Jimmy»)¡¿De dónde ha salido esa isla?!
¡¿Y qué ha pasado con la Isla del Templo?!
Vyse, ¡¿qué pasa aquí?!\c"
MS00010010,"\h(«Jimmy»)Yo quería irme de viaje contigo, pero mi padre
ha dicho que todavía soy muy pequeño para irme
yo solo.\e"
MS00010011,"\h(«Jimmy»)Así que os saludaré desde aquí, ¿eh?
¡¡Como os dejéis ganar por los tipos malos!!\c"
MS00020000,"\h(«Alan»)¡Mientras estabas fuera, he arreglado unas
cosillas en la isla!\e"
MS00020001,"\h(«Alan»)Je…… ¡Me siento como si pudiera hacerlo todo!
Bueno…… casi todo. Tu madre me ha ayudado a
mover cajas y esas cosas……\c"
MS00020002,"\h(«Alan»)¿Sabes qué? ¡Ha sido muy divertido reconstruirlo
todo! ¡Estoy satisfecho de construir cosas con
mis propias manos!\e"
MS00020003,"\h(«Alan»)¡A lo mejor me hago carpintero cuando sea mayor!
Aún soy muy pequeño…… ¡pero soñar no hace daño a
nadie! ¿Que opinas, Vyse?\c"
MS00020004,"\h(«Alan»)En este momento, todas las personas mayores
están ocupadas reconstruyendo el Albatross.\e"
MS00020005,"\h(«Alan»)¿Y sabes una cosa? ¡Trabajé tan bien en la
reconstrucción de la ciudad, que me han dejado
ayudar a reconstruir el navío también!\c"
MS00020006,"\h(«Alan»)¡Eh, Vyse! ¡Cuánto tiempo sin verte!\e"
MS00020007,"\h(«Alan»)¡Deberías venir a casa más a menudo! ¡Quiero que
me cuentes tus aventuras por ahí! ¡Apuesto a que
has visto muchas cosas!\c"
MS00020008,"\h(«Alan»)¿En serio? ¿Es verdad que hay un país llamado
Yafutoma donde se construyen los edificios
encima del agua?\e"
MS00020009,"\h(«Alan»)Ooh…… ¡Me encantaría poder construir algo así!
Claro…… que aquí no tenemos mucha agua donde
hacerlo……\c"
MS00020010,"\h(«Alan»)¡Vyse! ¡Oí un rugido horrible que venía de esa
isla encima de las nubes y me asusté tanto que
no sabía qué hacer!\c"
MS00020011,"\h(«Alan»)Ahora no queda nadie. Se fueron todos a navegar
en el Albatross. ¡Pero ya no estoy asustado!\e"
MS00020012,"\h(«Alan»)¡Todo irá bien! ¡Nosotros defenderemos esta isla
mientras los mayores están fuera combatiendo!
¡Dejadlo en nuestras manos!\c"
MS00030000,\h(«Lindsi»)¡Vyse! ¡Estás en casa! ¡¡Has vuelto!!\e
MS00030001,"\h(«Lindsi»)Te he echado tanto de menos…… Estaba preocupada
de que no volvieras……\c"
MS00030002,"\h(«Lindsi»)¡Bienvenido a casa, Vyse! ¡Deberías venir a
visitarnos más a menudo! ¡Te hemos echado de
menos!\c"
MS00030003,"\h(«Lindsi»)Ooh…… ¡Qué navío tan bonito, Vyse!
¿De dónde lo has sacado? ¡Tienes que dejarme
montar un día de estos!\c"
MS00030004,"\h(«Lindsi»)Oye, Pow…… Tienes que ocuparte de Vyse, ¿vale?\c"
MS00030005,"\h(«Lindsi»)¡¿En serio?!
¡¿Habéis navegado por todo el mundo?!\e"
MS00030006,"\h(«Lindsi»)¡Mi madre me ha contado que hay monstruos
horribles en el borde del mundo!
¿Os atacó alguno?\c"
MS00030007,"\h(«Lindsi»)Vyse…… Jimmy me contó que hay gente malvada en
esa isla…… ¿Es verdad?\e"
MS00030008,"\h(«Lindsi»)Por las noches, cuando pienso en esa isla……
Me…… Me entra tanto miedo que no puedo dormir……\c"
MS00030009,"\h(«Lindsi»)¡Será mejor que no les dejes ganar, Vyse!
¡¡No permitas que ganen los malos!!\e"
MS00030010,"\h(«Lindsi»)Prométeme que volverás a casa sano y salvo,
¿vale? ¡Promételo!\c"
MS00040000,\h(«Pow»)¡Pow pow!\e
MS00040001,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Qué tal andas, pequeñajo! Cómo te alegras de
vernos…… Je, je…… ¿Has cuidado de todos mientras
estaba fuera?\e"
MS00040002,\h(«Pow»)¡¡Pow pow pow!!\c
MS00040003,\h(«Pow»)¡Pow pow!\c
MS00040004,\h(«Pow»)¡Pow pow!\c
MS00040005,"\h(«Jimmy»)Umm…… Vyse, te quería pedir que hicieras algo
por nosotros……\e"
MS00040006,"\h(«Jimmy»)Todos deseamos ir contigo para ayudarte un
poco…… pero aún somos muy pequeños, supongo.
Por lo menos eso dicen nuestros padres……\e"
MS00040007,"\h(«Jimmy»)Así que, en lugar de eso, ¡queremos que te
lleves a Pow!\e"
MS00040008,\h(«Pow»)¡Pow pow!\c
MS00040009,"\h(«Alan»)Siempre hemos podido contar con Pow……
Él siempre ha estado disponible cuando
necesitábamos un poco de alegría.\e"
MS00040010,"\h(«Alan»)Y estábamos pensando que quizá, si Pow
va contigo, también te puede alegrar el día
cuando lo necesites, ¿sabes?\e"
MS00040011,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, ja…… entiendo.
Bueno, entonces…… Pow, ¡eres el miembro más
reciente de mi tripulación!\e"
MS00040012,"\h(«Lindsi»)¿Has oído eso, Pow? Vyse te va a llevar con él
de viaje. ¡Vas a ir a navegar en ese barco tan
grande con su tripulación!\e"
MS00040013,\h(«Pow»)¡Pow! ¡Pow pow!\c
MS00040014,"\h( )Pow se ha unido a tu tripulación como
“Bufón”…… o algo así.\c"
MS00050000,"\h(«Martha»)Vyse…… Quería darte las gracias por traer a mi
marido a casa. Sé que ese zángano no se habría
salvado él solo ni aun intentándolo.\e"
MS00050001,"\h(«Martha»)Aunque sea un zángano…… le quiero.
Me he dado cuenta mientras estaba fuera.
Le he echado de menos…… ¡Pero no se lo digas!\c"
MS00050002,"\h(«Martha»)¡¿Puedes creerlo?! Ese holgazán de mi marido
encima es un ingrato.
¡¿Sabes lo que me ha dicho?!\e"
MS00050003,"\h(«Martha»)“En Valua vi a las mujeres más bellas que he
visto en mi vida……”
¡ESO es lo que ha dicho!\e"
MS00050004,"\h(«Martha»)Here I was, worried sick about him… And all he
could do was admire the “beautiful women” in
Valua?! I can't believe him!!\c"
MS00050005,"\h(«Martha»)¡¿Te lo puedes creer?! Ese gandul de mi marido
no sabe lo que es la gratitud. ¡¿Sabes lo que me
dice?!\e"
MS00050006,"\h(«Martha»)“En Valua no podía apartar mi mente del viaje……
Sólo pensaba en navegar. Ah, y…… esto…… te
echaba de mucho menos, claro……”\e"
MS00050007,"\h(«Martha»)¡¿Te lo puedes creer?! “Ah, y…… esto…… te echaba
de mucho menos, claro……” ¡Y yo preocupada
mientras él pensaba en navegar!\c"
MS00050008,"\h(«Martha»)¡¿Te lo puedes creer?! Ese inútil de mi marido
encima es un ingrato. ¿¡Sabes lo que me ha
dicho?!\e"
MS00050009,"\h(«Martha»)“Cuando navego me siento como en casa.
Es tan relajante…… Me siento tan libre……
Oh, pero eso no significa nada……”\e"
MS00050010,"\h(«Martha»)¿¡No te parece increíble?! ¡¿Cómo que eso NO
significa nada?! Te juro que a partir de ahora
le encierro en casa a cal y canto……\c"
MS00050011,"\h(«Martha»)¡¿Puedes creerlo?! ¡Ese holgazán de mi marido es
un ingrato! ¡¿Sabes lo que me ha dicho?!\e"
MS00050012,"\h(«Martha»)“Mi meta en la vida es navegar por todo el mundo
como Vyse y conocer a muchas mujeres guapas.
Esto…… tú también eres muy mona.”\e"
MS00050013,"\h(«Martha»)¡¿Puedes creerte que me lo dijera?!
Te juro que…… ¡otro comentario como ése y no
vuelve a navegar en la vida!\c"
MS00050014,"\h(«Martha»)¿Sabes lo que acaba de decirme esa piraña de mi
marido? Miró en lontananza, en dirección a la
nueva isla y dijo……\e"
MS00050015,"\h(«Martha»)“Tú tranquila, Martha. Aunque tenga que
sacrificar mi propia vida, os protegeré a ti y a
los demás de cualquier cosa. Te lo juro.”\e"
MS00050016,"\h(«Martha»)Supongo…… que me quiere de verdad. A veces me lo
pregunto, pero…… en momentos como éste, me
siento la mujer más querida del mundo……\c"
MS00050017,"\h(«Martha»)¿Sabes lo que me acaba de decir ese vago de mi
marido? Justo antes de partir con los demás, se
da la vuelta y me dice……\e"
MS00050018,"\h(«Martha»)“No te preocupes…… estaré de vuelta antes de que
te des cuenta. ¡Y regresaré como un héroe!
¡Prepara un buen banquete en mi honor!”\e"
MS00050019,"\h(«Martha»)No sé…… A lo mejor no sabe cómo expresarse
claramente. Supongo que es la única manera que
tiene de expresar su amor.\c"
MS00060000,"\h(«Barbara»)Bienvenido, Vyse. Me han dicho que provocaste
toda una conmoción en Valua. Ja, ja…… Tu padre
debe estar orgulloso de ti.\e"
MS00060001,"\h(«Barbara»)No le digas que te lo he contado, pero tu madre
estaba preocupadísima.
Estaba tan feliz de verte otra vez.\c"
MS00060002,"\h(«Barbara»)¿Cómo te sientes después de tu primera aventura?
Debe ser genial viajar por tu cuenta……\e"
MS00060003,"\h(«Barbara»)Siempre supe que no eres el tipo de persona que
se sienta a esperar. Sabía que irte de aquí era
una cuestión de tiempo.\c"
MS00060004,"\h(«Barbara»)Desde que esa extraña isla apareció sobre la
Isla del Templo, todos los hombres han estado
ocupados en preparativos para la batalla.\e"
MS00060005,"\h(«Barbara»)Espero que sepan lo que hacen…… Me da mala
espina cada vez que veo esa isla……\c"
MS00060006,"\h(«Barbara»)¿Es eso cierto? ¿Valua fue devastada por las
Lluvias Destructoras?\e"
MS00060007,"\h(«Barbara»)Es horrible…… Estoy segura de que no todos los
Valuan eran mala gente…… Cuando pienso en todas
las vidas inocentes que se perdieron……\e"
MS00060008,"\h(«Barbara»)¡Vyse! ¡No puedes permitir que se salgan con la
suya! ¡Demuéstrales que con los Bandidos Azules
no se bromea!\c"
MS00070000,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)Sabes, durante un tiempo, empecé a pensar que no
iba a vivir para ver este lugar otra vez.\e"
MS00070001,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)Te debo una, Vyse. Por lo visto voy a seguir
siendo un Pirata Aéreo durante mucho tiempo.\c"
MS00070002,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)A diferencia de Valua, siempre sopla una brisa
de lo más agradable en la Isla del Pirata.
¡Ahhh!\c"
MS00070003,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)Ve a echar un vistazo al embarcadero
subterráneo.
Están construyendo el nuevo Albatross II.\e"
MS00070004,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)Se ha construido el 90%. Dentro de poco estará
listo para su viaje inaugural.
¡¡Estoy impaciente por salir a navegar!!\c"
MS00070005,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)¡Eh, Vyse! He oído que no sólo te las compusiste
para huir de Valua una vez más, encima les
robaste uno de sus mejores navíos.\e"
MS00070006,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)¡Es increíble! ¡Pero nosotros también tenemos un
navío nuevo! ¡Acabamos de terminar los últimos
preparativos para el Albatross II!\e"
MS00070007,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)¡Llevamos mucho tiempo trabajando en el puerto
subterráneo y por fin está terminado!
¡¡Estoy impaciente por sacar el barco!!\c"
MS00070008,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)¡Oye, Vyse! ¿Qué tal estás? El nuevo Albatross
vuela como el viento…… je, je.\e"
MS00070009,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)¡¿Qué?! ¡¿Has navegado por todo el mundo?!
¡¿Quieres decir que el mundo no es plano?
Hombre, Vyse…… Estoy impresionado……\c"
MS00080000,"\h(«Madre de Vyse»)¡Oh! ¡Estás en casa! ¿Quieres descansar un
ratito?\c"
MS00080001,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decir?»)“Claro, me vendría bien un descanso.”
“No…… Estoy bien. No estoy tan cansado.”\e"
MS00080002,"\h(«Vyse»)Claro, me vendría bien un descanso.\e"
MS00080003,"\h(«Madre de Vyse»)¡Genial! Te voy a hacer una cena muy rica,
¿vale? Tú vete arriba y ponte cómodo…… Cuando la
cena esté lista te aviso.\c"
MS00080004,"\h(«Madre de Vyse»)¡Buenos días! Ten mucho cuidado por ahí, ¿eh?
¡Y haz el favor de abrigarte bien si hace frío!\c"
MS00080005,"\h(«El Vicecapitán Briggs»)¡Buenos días! Ten mucho cuidado por ahí, ¿eh?
Rezaré por que las Lunas te protejan……\c"
MS00080006,"\h(«Vyse»)Mamá, perdona…… pero esta noche no.
Ya me quedaré otro día, ¿eh?\e"
MS00080007,"\h(«Madre de Vyse»)¿En serio? Bueno, está bien. Pero acuérdate de
que puedes quedarte aquí siempre que quieras
¿eh? ¡Ten mucho cuidado!\c"
MS00090000,"\h(«Jessica»)Te debo tanto, Vyse. Has traído a mi marido a
casa sano y salvo. No…… no puedo creerlo.\e"
MS00090001,"\h(«Jessica»)Pero, entre tú y yo, aún no he terminado esa
bufanda que estaba tejiendo. ¡Tengo que darme
prisa y terminarla!\c"
MS00090002,"\h(«Jessica»)Por fin he acabado esa bufanda que estaba
haciendo, pero como el color no me convencía, la
he empezado otra vez desde el principio.\e"
MS00090003,"\h(«Jessica»)Sé que es culpa mía, pero empiezo a pensar que
no voy a terminarla jamás……\c"
MS00090004,"\h(«Jessica»)Hombre, Vyse. Por fin he terminado esa bufanda
que estaba haciendo. Si quieres que te teja algo
no tienes más que pedirlo.\e"
MS00090005,"\h(«Jessica»)Bueno, si quieres que te diga la verdad……
¡¡Voy a tener un hijo!!\e"
MS00090006,"\h(«Jessica»)Ahora tengo que tejer las ropitas del niño.
¡Estoy impaciente por ver a mi niño vestidito
con todo lo que le estoy haciendo!\c"
MS00090007,"\h(«Jessica»)¡Parecía que algo terrible estuviese sucediendo
afuera! Hubo una ráfaga de viento…… Luego un
terrible rugido…… No sé qué hacer……\c"
MS00090008,"\h(«Jessica»)Mi marido se fue a la batalla. Dijo que para él
era importante luchar por nuestro hijo que aún
no ha nacido…… Es una monada……\e"
MS00090009,"\h(«Jessica»)Así que yo me quedaré aquí rezando para que
vuelva a casa sano y salvo después de ganar la
batalla.\c"
MS00100000,"\h(«Abuela»)Dicen que hay seis Lunas en este mundo:
la Roja, la Amarilla, la Verde, la Azul, la
Púrpura y la de Plata.\e"
MS00100001,"\h(«Abuela»)Acuérdate de rezar a cada una de ellas antes de
empezar un nuevo viaje. Siempre es mejor que
todas las Lunas velen por ti……\c"
MS00100002,"\h(«Abuela»)Dicen que hace muchos, muchos años, hubo una
gran civilización que florecía entre las nubes.\e"
MS00100003,"\h(«Abuela»)Sus gentes lograron crear maravillas
tecnológicas y una cultura muy avanzada.
Pero el orgullo y el rencor acabó con ellos.\e"
MS00100004,"\h(«Abuela»)Como castigo, las Lunas arrojaron a la
civilización entera bajo de las nubes, en el
Cielo Profundo y quedó oculta para siempre.\c"
MS00100005,"\h(«Abuela»)Nunca…… pensé que esa leyenda sobre la
civilización perdida fuera cierta, pero…… me
equivoqué…… Que las Lunas nos ayuden……\c"
MS00100006,"\h(«Abuela»)Parece que fue ayer cuando eras un bebé que
lloraba en brazos de su madre……\e"
MS00100007,"\h(«Abuela»)Y ahora estás aquí delante de mí, hecho un
hombre adulto. Ve, Vyse…… Ve a realizar tu
destino. Yo rezaré por ti……\c"
MS00110000,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)En la batalla, tus enemigos pueden hacer otras
cosas aparte de daño físico en tu grupo.
Yo te puedo enseñar algunas técnicas.\e"
MS00110001,"\h(«¿Sobre qué te gustaría aprender?»)“Sobre Sueño, Confusión y Silencio.”
“Sobre Veneno, Fatiga y Petrificación.”
“No quiero aprender nada.”\e"
MS00110002,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Si el enemigo te contagia el “Sueño” no podrás
seguir luchando hasta que se pase el efecto o
hasta que seas acertado por el enemigo.\e"
MS00110003,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Pero el tiempo que pasas dormido varía. A veces
te vas a despertar enseguida, y otras veces
puede que te lleve un rato.\c"
MS00110004,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)“Confusión” se refiere a un estado en el que ya
no puedes distinguir entre un amigo y un
enemigo, y disparas al objetivo más cercano.\e"
MS00110005,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Si un personaje con un alto poder de ataque está
confuso, puede resultar desastroso para todo el
grupo. Ten mucho cuidado, Vyse.\e"
MS00110006,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)El “Silencio” es una condición muy mala.
Te impide conjurar cualquier hechizo mágico
hasta que te hayas curado.\e"
MS00110007,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Tendrás que cuidar mucho tu salud. Como no
podrás conjurar ningún hechizo, tendrás que usar
los objetos.\e"
MS00110008,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Si tú o cualquiera de los miembros de tu grupo
es “Envenenado”, recibirás daños de forma
continuada a lo largo de la batalla.\e"
MS00110009,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Cuanto más dure la batalla, más daño recibirás.
O sea, que si crees que la batalla va a ser
larga, mejor será que te cures.\e"
MS00110010,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Si uno de vosotros se encuentra alguna vez en un
estado de “Fatiga”, no podrá recuperar los
puntos de Espíritu.\e"
MS00110011,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Sin Espíritu, es imposible conjurar magia o
cualquier otra técnica especial. No te interesa
que eso te suceda.\e"
MS00110012,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Además tienes la “Petrificación”. Cuando sucede
eso, tu cuerpo se convierte en piedra y no
puedes moverte.\e"
MS00110013,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Y te quedas así durante varios turnos. La única
forma de curar esa condición es con magia o
usando algunos objetos.\e"
MS00110014,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)¿En serio? Está bien. ¡Creo que tendrás que
aprender viviéndolo tú mismo! ¡¡Ja, ja, ja!!\e"
MS00110015,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Ah, otra cosa. Una vez haya terminado la
batalla, cualquier condición negativa que estés
sufriendo remite inmediatamente.\e"
MS00110016,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Así que no te molestes en curarte después de una
batalla, porque estarás perdiendo el tiempo.\c"
MS00110017,"\h(«Timmus el Cañonero»)Me parece que se avecinan problemas……
Eh…… ¡Estoy impaciente por un poco de acción!
“¡¡Vamos allá!!”\c"
MS00120000,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Vyse, ¿sabías que existen seis tipos distintos
de Magia? Puedo enseñártelos si quieres……\e"
MS00120001,"\h(«¿Sobre qué quieres aprender?»)“Sobre los hechizos Verde, Rojo y Púrpura.”
“Sobre los hechizos Azul, Amarillo y Plata.”
“No quiero aprender sobre nada.”\e"
MS00120002,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)La Magia Verde usa los poderes de la naturaleza
para curar el cuerpo del que la recibe.
Los hechizos “Sacri” son curativos.\e"
MS00120003,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Pero también existen los hechizos de Magia Verde
“Noxi”, que usan los poderes de la naturaleza
para envenenar al enemigo.\e"
MS00120004,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Los hechizos Rojos utilizan el fuego.
Los hechizos “Pyri” consumen con llamas intensas
a todos los enemigos que haya a la vista.\e"
MS00120005,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Y están los hechizos “Increm”, que aumenta las
habilidades combativas del que lo recibe y
aumenta su poder de ataque y defensa.\e"
MS00120006,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)No sé mucho acerca de los hechizos Púrpura, pero
creo que hay una línea de hechizos de hielo
llamada “Crystali”.\e"
MS00120007,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)También he oído hablar de un hechizo Púrpura que
tiene el poder de afectar a la mente del
objetivo.\c"
MS00120008,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)No sé mucho sobre hechizos Azules……
Según los rumores incluyen hechizos que
ralentizan a tu enemigo o le ponen a dormir……\e"
MS00120009,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)También he oído que hay hechizos “Wevli” que
pueden convocar un remolino pequeño para hacer
daño a un grupo reducido de enemigos……\e"
MS00120010,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Los hechizos Amarillos son hechizos de rayo y
reciben el nombre de “Electri”. Atacan a todos
los enemigos en línea recta.\e"
MS00120011,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Hay otro hechizo, el Driln, que reduce la
Agilidad de tu enemigo y todas su habilidades de
combate.\e"
MS00120012,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Y por último, están los hechizos de Plata……
Muy poca gente ha estudiado estos hechizos,
así que no se sabe mucho sobre ellos.\e"
MS00120013,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Pero sé que hay un hechizo que supuestamente
puede curar toda clase de dolencias corporales……\e"
MS00120014,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Y he oído que hay un hechizo que revive a quien
esté inconsciente, y otro que puede matar a tu
enemigo instantáneamente……\c"
MS00120015,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Bueno, sí que te veo seguro de ti mismo……
Me parece bien, pero si te surge alguna duda, no
dudes en preguntarme, ¿de acuerdo?\c"
MS00120016,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Te he enseñado todo lo que sé, Vyse.
Ya no queda mucho más que yo te pueda enseñar.\e"
MS00120017,"\h(«Borris el Cañonero»)Has aprendido lo suficiente para sobrevivir por
ahí en los cielos. ¡Usa tus nuevos conocimientos
con criterio!\c"
MS00190000,"\h(«Patch el Marino»)Os debo mucho, chicos. Si no fuera por vuestra
valentía, ninguno de nosotros habría logrado
regresar a la Isla del Pirata.\e"
MS00190001,"\h(«Patch el Marino»)Sólo quería que supieras que…… te estoy muy
agradecido. Tu padre hizo un buen trabajo
contigo, Vyse.\c"
MS00190002,"\h(«Patch el Marino»)¡Podéis contar conmigo para seguir vigilando!
¡Puede que sólo sea un Marino, pero según Ben,
tampoco se me daría mal ser el centinela!\e"
MS00190003,"\h(«Patch el Marino»)Tengo una preciosa mujercita a la que proteger.
No voy a permitir que esos Valuan vuelvan a
atacar esta isla.\c"
MS00190004,"\h(«Patch el Marino»)¡Estaba vigilando como siempre, cuando de
repente el viento empezó a soplar fuerte y casi
me arrastró de la Isla Centinela!\e"
MS00190005,"\h(«Patch el Marino»)¡Y entonces masas de tierra se levantaron una
detrás de otra de debajo de las nubes y se
transformaron en esa isla tan enorme!\c"
Ms002c000,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a small supply box. There are usually all
sorts of fishing and sailing equipment piled up
in here, but it's empty right now.\c"
Ms002c001,"\h(«Vyse»)I guess the butterflies have returned now that
everything's been fixed and all the flowers
have been replanted.\c"
Ms002c002,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a bag full of Moon Stones. I think these
are going to be loaded onto the ship. They're
probably going to be used as fuel.\c"
Ms002c003,"\h(«Vyse»)We use this windmill as a power source to raise
and lower heavy cargo in and out of our ship
in the underground port.\e"
Ms002c004,"\h(«Vyse»)While they aren't necessarily rare, we try to
conserve Moon Stones whenever we can. So, we use
wind power for some things instead.\c"
Ms002c005,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a box full of bullets. My father is really
the only one that uses a gun around here. I
prefer using cutlasses.\c"
Ms002c006,"\h(«Vyse»)We use this windmill as a power source to raise
and lower heavy cargo in and out of our ship
in the underground port.\e"
Ms002c007,"\h(«Vyse»)While they aren't necessarily rare, we try to
conserve Moon Stones whenever we can. So, we use
wind power for some things instead.\c"
Ms002c008,"\h(«Vyse»)This fireplace seems well used. Wait… is that
gunpowder I smell? Geez… Aika probably throws
gunpowder in this thing for fun. She's crazy…\c"
Ms002c009,"\h(«Vyse»)Wait a second there… I may be an Air Pirate,
but I am a gentleman. I refuse to look through
a lady's dresser without permission.\e"
Ms002c010,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… This is that ragged, old doll that Aika
used to carry around when she was a kid. I
guess she still has it.\c"
Ms002c011,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this? I didn't know Aika had a vanity.
I guess even she can be feminine at times.\c"
Ms002c012,"\h(«Vyse»)Both of Aika's parents passed away when we
were still little kids.\e"
Ms002c013,"\h(«Vyse»)So, there's only one bed here in her place.
She tosses and turns in her sleep a lot, so
she needs a rather large bed.\c"
Ms002c014,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a shield that we got from a Valuan ship
some time ago. Shields are too cumbersome to be
useful to us, so we just use it as decoration.\c"
Ms002c015,"\h(«Vyse»)Spears can be really useful when raiding wooden
ships. All you have to do is light the tip on
fire and it can cause a lot of damage.\c"
Ms002c016,"\h(«Vyse»)We use this pillar to practice punching and
kicking. A lot of raids break out into melees,
so we all need to know how to fight.\c"
Ms002c017,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, I may be an Air Pirate, but I would never
steal from an old lady's dresser.\c"
Ms002c018,"\h(«Vyse»)This smell…
Oh man, this has to be salted fish.
I regret even looking in here…\c"
Ms002c019,"\h(«Vyse»)Granny used to cook bread in this fireplace for
me and Aika all the time when we were kids. She
really does make the best bread.\e"
Ms002c020,"\h(«Vyse»)But, ever since Lindsi, Alan, and Jimmy were
born, they get to eat everything that Granny
makes.\c"
Ms002c021,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this…?
Yuck!!! It's her denture cleaning solution!\c"
Ms002c022,"\h(«Vyse»)It's full of fresh water. I wonder who left it
here…\c"
Ms002c023,"\h(«Vyse»)The jar is filled with pickled turnips. Every
time I smell turnips, I always think of
sailing… That's all we ever eat out there…\c"
Ms002c024,"\h(«Vyse»)It's filled with all sorts of tableware.
There're even some smaller utensils, probably
for the little kids.\c"
Ms002c025,"\h(«Vyse»)It's just a fireplace. I remember many times as
a kid warming myself to a fire here, after being
outside all day during the cold season.\c"
Ms002c026,"\h(«Vyse»)A water jar used for cooking. We all get our
water from the well, so we need containers to
store the water before we use it.\c"
Ms002c027,"\h(«Vyse»)A bandana… a striped shirt… It's filled with
old, worn-out clothes. Some people just get
attached to their stuff, I guess…\c"
Ms002c028,"\h(«Vyse»)After returning from a long voyage, there's
nothing quite like collapsing in your own bed.
It's the best feeling in the world.\c"
Ms002c029,"\h(«Vyse»)My old man is always out sailing, so his bed
isn't very worn in. It looks almost brand new.\c"
Ms002c030,"\h(«Vyse»)This is our fireplace. Mom uses it daily to cook
for herself… and for us when we're actually
home and not out sailing.\c"
Ms002c031,"\h(«Vyse»)It's my bed. But, I've been out sailing with my
dad a lot lately, so I really only sleep in it
on occasion.\c"
Ms002c032,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a book that we picked up on one of our
raids. Books are really hard to come by, so
they're one of our most treasured finds.\e"
Ms002c033,"\h(«Vyse»)I once read a book on the art of navigation over
and over again until the bindings were all worn 
out. I hope the knowledge will come in handy…\c"
Ms002c034,"\h(«Vyse»)Oops… I left my papers all over the place. I'm
surprised Mom didn't get on my case about the
mess that I left.\e"
Ms002c035,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, I was only studying about the stars. She
should be happy that I'm not just sitting around
doing nothing, I suppose.\c"
Ms002c036,"\h(«Vyse»)It says “Windmill Island.” That's what this
island is called on most maps. But, nobody that
lives here actually calls it by that name.\e"
Ms002c037,"\h(«Vyse»)This place's real name is “Pirate Isle.” We only
use Windmill Island as a cover name to avoid
getting caught by the Valuan Empire.\c"
Ms002c038,"\h(«Vyse»)This is our well. It's very valuable to us here
on Pirate Isle. Actually, one time when we were
still kids, Aika fell inside the well…\c"
Ms002c039,"\h(«Vyse»)The ladies of the town often use these boxes to
sit and rest on while drawing water from the
well. It's sort of the town gossip area.\c"
Ms002c040,"\h(«Vyse»)I used to climb this tree all the time when I
was a little kid. It was destroyed during the
Armada's attack and had to be cut down.\c"
Ms002c041,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… It looks like someone's already replanted
all the flowers that were destroyed during the
Armada's attack.\c"
Ms002c042,"\h(«Vyse»)There's always a steady breeze that blows
through this region, so our laundry dries
really quickly.\c"
Ms002c043,"\h(«Vyse»)There's always a steady breeze that blows
through this region, so our laundry dries
really quickly.\c"
Ms002c044,"\h(«Vyse»)Isn't this the laundry tub?
Who left it just sitting out here like this?\c"
Ms002c049,\h( )“Please do not step on the garden.”\e
Ms002c045,"\h(«Vyse»)… Vegetables are an important source of
nutrients for sailors. Everyone takes great care
to make sure and grow them properly.\c"
Ms002c046,"\h(«Vyse»)This is our incinerator. It's connected to the
fireplace inside. That way, they both can use
the same chimney.\c"
Ms002c047,"\h(«Vyse»)It's easy to get scurvy when you're always out
sailing. It's hard to get enough vegetables, so
that's why pickled turnips are so important.\c"
Ms002c048,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Return to the Delphinus.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
MFs002c000,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici une petite boîte d'équipement. En général,
on y trouve tous types d'outils de pêche et de
navigation. Mais pour l'instant, elle est vide.\c"
MFs002c001,"\h(«Vyse»)Je pense que les papillons sont revenus
maintenant que tout a été réparé et que les
fleurs ont été replantées.\c"
MFs002c002,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici un sac plein de Pierres de Lune. Je crois
qu'elles vont être chargées à bord du navire
pour servir de carburant.\c"
MFs002c003,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous nous servons de la force issue de ce moulin
à vent pour charger ou décharger la cargaison
dans les ports souterrains.\e"
MFs002c004,"\h(«Vyse»)Même si elles ne sont pas nécessairement rares,
nous essayons de conserver les Pierres de Lune
le plus possible. Ainsi, nous utilisons parfois
la force du vent à la place.\c"
MFs002c005,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici une boîte pleine de balles. Mon père est
la seule personne qui utilise un pistolet par
ici. Je préfère utiliser des sabres.\c"
MFs002c006,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous nous servons de la force issue de ce moulin
à vent pour charger ou décharger la cargaison
dans les ports souterrains.\e"
MFs002c007,"\h(«Vyse»)Même si elles ne sont pas nécessairement rares,
nous essayons de conserver les Pierres de Lune
le plus possible. Ainsi, nous utilisons parfois
la force du vent à la place.\c"
MFs002c008,"\h(«Vyse»)Cette cheminée semble être bien utilisée. Mais……
serait-ce l'odeur de poudre à canon ? Aika est
sans doute en train d'en jeter pour s'amuser.
Elle est folle…… !\c"
MFs002c009,"\h(«Vyse»)Attends un instant…… Je suis peut-être un Pirate
de l'Air, mais je suis un gentleman. Je refuse
de fouiller dans les affaires d'une femme sans
sa permission.\c"
MFs002c010,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé, c'est la vieille poupée que Aika emmenait
partout quand elle était enfant. Je pense
qu'elle l'a encore.\c"
MFs002c011,"\h(«Vyse»)Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Je ne savais pas qu'Aika
était vaniteuse. Elle peut être très féminine
par moments.\c"
MFs002c012,"\h(«Vyse»)Les deux parents d'Aika sont morts lorsque nous
étions encore enfants.\e"
MFs002c013,"\h(«Vyse»)Il n'y a qu'un seul lit chez elle. Elle remue
beaucoup dans son sommeil alors elle a besoin
d'un grand lit.\c"
MFs002c014,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici un bouclier que nous avons trouvé sur un
vaisseau Valuan il y a quelque temps. Les
boucliers sont trop encombrants pour la bataille
alors ils ne servent que de décoration.\c"
MFs002c015,"\h(«Vyse»)Les lances peuvent être très utiles lors d'une
attaque d'un vaisseau en bois. Il suffit
d'allumer l'extrémité pour causer des dégâts
considérables.\c"
MFs002c016,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous utilisons ce pilier pour nous entraîner aux
coups de pieds et aux coups de poings. De
nombreuses attaques se terminent en mêlées. Il
est donc important de savoir se battre.\c"
MFs002c017,"\h(«Vyse»)Je suis peut-être un Pirate de l'Air, mais
jamais je n'oserai voler une vieille dame.\c"
MFs002c018,"\h(«Vyse»)Quelle odeur……
Ce doit être du poisson salé.
Je regrette d'avoir regardé là dedans !\c"
MFs002c019,"\h(«Vyse»)Quand nous étions petits, Grand-mère nous
faisait du pain dans cette cheminée. Elle
faisait le meilleur pain qu'il soit !\e"
MFs002c020,"\h(«Vyse»)Mais depuis la naissance de Lindsi, Alan et
Jimmy, ils mangent tout ce que prépare
Grand-mère.\c"
MFs002c021,"\h(«Vyse»)Qu'est-ce que c'est…… ?
Berk !!! C'est le produit dans lequel elle met
son dentier !\c"
MFs002c022,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est plein d'eau fraîche. Je me demande qui l'a
laissée là……\c"
MFs002c023,"\h(«Vyse»)Ce pot contient des navets macérés dans le
vinaigre. Chaque fois que je sens des navets, je
pense aux voyages…… C'est tout ce que l'on
mangeait lorsque l'on naviguait.\c"
MFs002c024,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a plein de vaisselle différente. Il y a
même des ustensiles plus petits, certainement
pour les enfants.\c"
MFs002c025,"\h(«Vyse»)Ce n'est qu'une cheminée. Quand j'étais petit,
je me souviens que je me réchauffais au coin du
feu, après avoir passé la journée dehors en
plein hiver.\c"
MFs002c026,"\h(«Vyse»)Un pot à eau utilisé pour cuisiner…… Nous
utilisons tous l'eau du puits. Nous avons donc
besoin de conteneurs pour conserver l'eau avant
de l'utiliser.\c"
MFs002c027,"\h(«Vyse»)Un bandana…… un T-shirt à rayures…… Il y a des
tas de vieux vêtements usés. Je pense que les
gens s'attachent à leurs affaires…\c"
MFs002c028,"\h(«Vyse»)Après un long voyage, il n'y a rien de tel que
de retrouver un bon lit. C'est un sentiment très
agréable.\c"
MFs002c029,"\h(«Vyse»)Mon père est toujours en voyage. Son lit n'est
donc pas beaucoup utilisé. On dirait qu'il est
encore tout neuf.\c"
MFs002c030,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici notre cheminée. Ma mère l'utilise tous les
jours pour faire à manger pour elle et pour nous
lorsque nous ne sommes pas en voyage.\c"
MFs002c031,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici mon lit. Mais j'ai beaucoup voyagé avec
mon père ces derniers temps, alors je ne
l'utilise pas beaucoup.\c"
MFs002c032,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici un livre que nous avons récupéré lors de
l'un de nos voyages. Il est difficile d'en
trouver alors les livres sont de véritables
objets précieux pour nous.\e"
MFs002c033,"\h(«Vyse»)Une fois, j'ai lu un livre sur l'art de
naviguer. Je l'ai tellement lu que la reliure
était toute abîmée. J'espère pouvoir utiliser
tout ce que j'ai appris dans ce livre……\c"
MFs002c034,"\h(«Vyse»)Zut…… j'ai laissé mes papiers partout. Je suis
surpris que ma mère n'ait rien dit, avec tout ce
désordre……\e"
MFs002c035,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh bien, j'étudiais les étoiles. Elle devrait
être contente. Au moins, je ne passe pas mon
temps à ne rien faire……\c"
MFs002c036,"\h(«Vyse»)Il est indiqué “Île du Moulin.” C'est le nom que
cette île porte sur la plupart des cartes. Mais
ses habitants ne l'appellent pas comme ça.\e"
MFs002c037,"\h(«Vyse»)Le vrai nom de cet endroit est “l'Île des
Pirates.” Le nom Île du Moulin est une
couverture pour éviter que l'Empire Valuan
s'empare de nous.\c"
MFs002c038,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici notre puits. Il est très précieux pour
nous sur l'Île Pirate. Et lorsque nous
étions petit, Aika est même tombée dedans…\c"
MFs002c039,"\h(«Vyse»)Les femmes de la ville utilisent souvent ces
caisses pour s'asseoir et se reposer
lorsqu'elles tirent de l'eau du puits. C'est un
peu le quartier des commérages.\c"
MFs002c040,"\h(«Vyse»)Lorsque j'étais petit, je grimpais sans cesse à
cet arbre. Il a été détruit pendant l'attaque de
l'Armada et il a dû être coupé.\c"
MFs002c041,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé…… On dirait que quelqu'un a déjà replanté
toutes les fleurs qui ont été détruites pendant
l'attaque de l'Armada.\c"
MFs002c042,"\h(«Vyse»)Un petit vent souffle toujours sur cette région.
Ainsi, notre linge sèche très rapidement.\c"
MFs002c043,"\h(«Vyse»)Un petit vent souffle toujours sur cette région.
Ainsi, notre linge sèche très rapidement.\c"
MFs002c044,"\h(«Vyse»)Mais, c'est le bac à linge ?
Qui l'a laissé traîner comme ça ?\c"
MFs002c049,\h( )“Veuillez ne pas marcher dans le jardin.”\e
MFs002c045,"\h(«Vyse»)…… Les légumes sont un aliment important pour
les marins. Chacun fait bien attention à ce
qu'ils poussent correctement.\c"
MFs002c046,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici notre incinérateur. Il est relié à la
cheminée à l'intérieur de la maison. Ainsi, ils
peuvent utiliser la même cheminée.\c"
MFs002c047,"\h(«Vyse»)Lorsque l'on part en voyage, il est facile
d'attraper le scorbut. Il est difficile d'avoir
suffisamment de légumes, c'est pourquoi les
navets sont si importants.\c"
MFs002c048,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“Vous retournerez sur le Delphinus.”
“Vous resterez encore un peu ici.”\c"
MGs002c000,"\h(«Vyse»)Es ist eine kleine Vorratskiste. Enthält
normalerweise allerlei Ausrüstung für
Fischerei und Seefahrt, ist aber im
Moment leer.\c"
MGs002c001,"\h(«Vyse»)Die Schmetterlinge sind wohl zurückgekommen,
jetzt wo alles repariert ist und neue Blumen
gepflanzt wurden.\c"
MGs002c002,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein ganzer Sack voller Moon Stones. Ich glaube,
die sollen auf das Schiff geladen werden.
Sie werden wahrscheinlich als Treibstoff
verwendet.\c"
MGs002c003,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir benutzen diese Windmühle als Energiequelle,
um schwere Ladung vom Schiff in den
unterirdischen Hafen zu verfrachten.\e"
MGs002c004,"\h(«Vyse»)Auch wenn Moon Stones nicht gerade selten sind,
versuchen wir trotzdem, sparsam damit umzugehen.
Wo es geht, setzen wir deshalb Windenergie ein.\c"
MGs002c005,"\h(«Vyse»)Eine ganze Kiste mit Munition. Mein Vater ist
jedoch der Einzige, der hier eine Pistole
benutzt. Ich bevorzuge Entermesser.\c"
MGs002c006,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir benutzen diese Windmühle als Energiequelle,

MGs002c008,"\h(«Vyse»)Dieser Kamin sieht viel benutzt aus. Moment……
ist das der Geruch von Schießpulver? He……
Aika wirft anscheinend aus Spaß Schießpulver
hinein. Sie ist verrückt……\c"
MGs002c009,"\h(«Vyse»)Moment mal…… Ich bin vielleicht ein Luftpirat,
aber trotzdem ein Gentleman. Ich schaue nicht
ohne Erlaubnis in den Schrank einer Dame.\c"
MGs002c010,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh…… das ist doch die lumpige, alte Puppe,
die Aika als Kind überallhin mitgeschleppt hat.
Sie hat sie wohl immer noch.\c"
MGs002c011,"\h(«Vyse»)Nanu? Ich wusste gar nicht, dass Aika eitel ist.
Manchmal hat offenbar auch sie weibliche Züge.\c"
MGs002c012,"\h(«Vyse»)Aikas Eltern starben beide,
als wir noch klein waren.\e"
MGs002c013,"\h(«Vyse»)Deshalb gibt es in ihrem Haus auch nur ein Bett.
Sie wälzt sich oft im Schlaf hin und her,
so dass sie ein ziemlich großes Bett braucht.\c"
MGs002c014,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein Schild, den wir einmal bei einem Überfall
auf ein valuanisches Schlachtschiff erbeutet
haben. Schilde stören uns bloß im Kampf,
deshalb benutzen wir ihn als Dekoration.\c"
MGs002c015,"\h(«Vyse»)Speere sind sehr praktisch bei Überfällen auf
Holzschiffe. Man muss nur die Spitze anzünden
und kann so großen Schaden anrichten.\c"
MGs002c016,"\h(«Vyse»)An diesem Pfeiler üben wir Schlagen und Treten.
Viele Überfälle enden in einem Handgemenge,
also muss jeder von uns kämpfen können.\c"
MGs002c017,"\h(«Vyse»)He, ich bin vielleicht ein Pirat,
aber ich würde nie etwas aus dem
Schrank einer Dame stehlen.\c"
MGs002c018,"\h(«Vyse»)Das stinkt……
Oh Mann, das muss gesalzener Fisch sein.
Hier hätte ich besser nicht reingeschaut……\c"
MGs002c019,"\h(«Vyse»)Meine Oma hat in diesem Kamin immer Brot für
mich und Aika gebacken, als wir klein waren.
Ihr Brot ist immer noch das beste.\e"
MGs002c020,"\h(«Vyse»)Aber seit Lindsi, Alan und Jimmy auf der Welt
sind, kriegen sie immer alles, was Oma macht.\c"
MGs002c021,"\h(«Vyse»)Was ist das……?
Igitt!!! Das ist ihr Gebissreiniger!\c"
MGs002c022,"\h(«Vyse»)Er ist mit frischem Wasser gefüllt.
Wie der wohl hierher kommt……\c"
MGs002c023,"\h(«Vyse»)Der Krug ist mit eingelegten Rüben gefüllt.
Wenn ich Rüben rieche, muss ich immer an
die Seefahrt denken…… Das ist das Einzige, was
wir auf See bekommen……\c"
MGs002c024,"\h(«Vyse»)Da ist allerlei Geschirr drin, sogar ein paar
kleinere Sachen. Wahrscheinlich für
kleine Kinder.\c"
MGs002c025,"\h(«Vyse»)Nur ein Kamin. Ich weiß noch, wie ich mich als
Kind im Winter hier immmer am Feuer gewärmt
habe, nachdem ich den ganzen Tag draußen
verbracht hatte.\c"
MGs002c026,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein Wasserkrug zum Kochen. Wir holen unser
Wasser vom Brunnen und brauchen deshalb
Behälter, in denen wir das Wasser aufbewahren
können, bis wir es brauchen.\c"
MGs002c027,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein buntes Tuch…… ein gestreiftes Hemd……
Da ist lauter alte, abgetragene Kleidung drin.
Manche Leute hängen wohl sehr an ihren Sachen……\c"
MGs002c028,"\h(«Vyse»)Nach einer langen Reise gibt es nichts
Schöneres als ins eigene Bett zu fallen.
Ein herrliches Gefühl.\c"
MGs002c029,"\h(«Vyse»)Mein Vater ist ständig auf See und benutzt
sein Bett nur selten. Sieht fast wie neu aus.\c"
MGs002c030,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist unser Kamin. Mutter benutzt ihn täglich,
um für sich zu kochen…… und für uns,
wenn wir ausnahmsweise mal zu Hause sind.\c"
MGs002c031,"\h(«Vyse»)Mein Bett. Allerdings bin ich in letzter Zeit
viel mit meinem Vater auf See und schlafe
nur gelegentlich darin.\c"
MGs002c032,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein Buch von einem unserer Beutezüge.
Bücher sind schwer zu bekommen und
deshalb besonders wertvoll.\e"
MGs002c033,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich hab mal ein Buch über Navigation so oft
gelesen, bis es auseinanderfiel.Ich hoffe,
dass ich das Wissen einmal gebrauchen kann……\c"
MGs002c034,"\h(«Vyse»)Huch…… Ich habe ja überall Papiere liegen
lassen. Komisch, dass Mutter gar nichts gesagt
hat zu dieser Unordnung.\e"
MGs002c035,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich hab ja nur etwas über die Sterne gelernt.
Ich denke, sie kann froh sein, dass ich nicht
nur untätig rumsitze.\c"
MGs002c036,"\h(«Vyse»)Da steht “Windmill Island.” So heißt diese
Insel auf den meisten Karten. Aber keiner,
der hier wohnt, nennt sie wirklich so.\e"
MGs002c037,"\h(«Vyse»)Dieser Ort heißt eigentlich “Pirate Isle.” Wir
benutzen Windmill Island nur als Decknamen,
damit uns die Valuaner nicht finden.\c"
MGs002c038,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist unser Brunnen. Er ist sehr wertvoll für
alle hier auf Pirate Isle. Einmal, als wir noch
klein waren, fiel Aika hinein……\c"
MGs002c039,"\h(«Vyse»)Die Frauen der Stadt ruhen sich oft auf diesen
Kisten aus, wenn sie Wasser vom Brunnen holen.
Hier gibt es den neuesten Klatsch.\c"
MGs002c040,"\h(«Vyse»)Als Kind bin ich immer auf diesen Baum
geklettert. Er wurde beim Angriff der Armada
getroffen und musste gefällt werden.\c"
MGs002c041,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh…… sieht aus, als hätte schon jemand
die ganzen Blumen, die beim Angriff der
Armada vernichtet wurden, neu gepflanzt.\c"
MGs002c042,"\h(«Vyse»)In dieser Gegend weht immer ein starker Wind,
so dass die Wäsche schnell trocknet.\c"
MGs002c043,"\h(«Vyse»)In dieser Gegend weht immer ein starker Wind,
so dass die Wäsche schnell trocknet.\c"

Wer hat ihn denn einfach hier stehen lassen?\c"
MGs002c049,\h( )“Bitte die Beete nicht betreten.”\e
MGs002c045,"\h(«Vyse»)…… Gemüse ist eine wichtige Nahrungsquelle
für Seeleute. Jeder bemüht sich, damit es
anständig wachsen kann.\c"
MGs002c046,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist unser Ofen. Er ist mit dem Kamin drinnen
verbunden, damit beide den gleichen Abzug
benutzen können.\c"
MGs002c047,"\h(«Vyse»)Wenn man ständig auf See ist, bekommt man
leicht Skorbut. Man kriegt kaum genug Gemüse,
deshalb sind eingelegte Rüben so wichtig.\c"

“Noch etwas hier bleiben.”\c"
MSs002c000,"\h(«Vyse»)Es una caja de provisiones pequeña. Suele
tener todo tipo de instrumentos de pesca y
navegación, pero ahora mismo está vacía.\c"
MSs002c001,"\h(«Vyse»)Supongo que las mariposas han vuelto ahora que
todo ha vuelto a la normalidad y se han plantado
todas las flores.\c"
MSs002c002,"\h(«Vyse»)Es una bolsa llena de Piedras Lunares. Creo
que las van a llevar al navío. Seguramente
las utilizarán como combustible.\c"
MSs002c003,"\h(«Vyse»)Usamos este molino de viento como una fuente
de energía para cargar y descargar la mercancía
pesada del navío en el puerto.\e"
MSs002c004,"\h(«Vyse»)Aunque no son precisamente raras, intentamos
reservar las Piedras Lunares. Por eso
aprovechamos el viento siempre que podemos.\c"
MSs002c005,"\h(«Vyse»)Es una caja llena de balas. En realidad,
mi padre es el único que tiene una pistola
por aquí. Yo prefiero usar sables.\c"

de energía para cargar y descargar la mercancía

MSs002c008,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece que a esta chimenea se le da buen uso.
Espera…… ¿No huele a pólvora? Aika estará
jugando por aquí con la pólvora. Está loca……\c"
MSs002c009,"\h(«Vyse»)Oye, oye…… Puede que sea un Pirata Aéreo,
pero soy un caballero. Me niego a husmear
en la cómoda de una dama sin permiso.\c"
MSs002c010,"\h(«Vyse»)Je, je…… Ésta es la muñeca harapienta y vieja
que Aika siempre llevaba a todas partes cuando
era pequeña. Creo que todavía la tiene.\c"
MSs002c011,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Qué es esto? No sabía que Aika era vanidosa.
Supongo que ella también es femenina a veces.\c"
MSs002c012,"\h(«Vyse»)Los padres de Aika murieron cuando
los dos éramos muy pequeños.\e"
MSs002c013,"\h(«Vyse»)Así que sólo hay una cama en su casa.
Ella da muchas vueltas cuando duerme,
así que necesita una cama grande.\c"
MSs002c014,"\h(«Vyse»)Es un escudo que cogimos en un asalto a un navío
Valuan hace tiempo. Los escudos son un estorbo,
así que lo tenemos de decoración.\c"
MSs002c015,"\h(«Vyse»)Los arpones son muy útiles para abordar navíos
de madera. Sólo tienes que prenderle fuego
a la punta para que cause aún más daño.\c"
MSs002c016,"\h(«Vyse»)Con este pilar practicamos los golpes y
las patadas. Muchos asaltos acaban en pelea,
así que debemos saber luchar bien.\c"
MSs002c017,"\h(«Vyse»)Oye, puede que sea un Pirata Aéreo,
pero nunca robaría nada de la cómoda
de una anciana.\c"
MSs002c018,"\h(«Vyse»)¿A qué huele……?
¡No! Esto tiene que ser pescado salado.
¡Para qué me habré molestado en mirar……!\c"
MSs002c019,"\h(«Vyse»)Mi abuela nos hacía pan a mí y a Aika
en esta chimenea cuando éramos pequeños.
Hacía el mejor pan del mundo.\e"
MSs002c020,"\h(«Vyse»)Pero cuando nacieron Lindsi, Alan y Jimmy,
ellos siempre se comían lo que la abuela hacía.\c"
MSs002c021,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Qué es esto?……
¡¡¡Qué asco!!!
¡Es su solución para limpiarse los dientes!\c"
MSs002c022,"\h(«Vyse»)Está lleno de agua fresca.
Quién lo habrá dejado por aquí……\c"
MSs002c023,"\h(«Vyse»)El frasco está lleno de nabos en vinagre. Su
olor me recuerda a cuando navego…… Es lo
único que comemos……\c"
MSs002c024,"\h(«Vyse»)Está lleno de todo tipo de servicios de mesa.
Incluso trae unos pequeños utensilios.
Seguramente para los más pequeños.\c"
MSs002c025,"\h(«Vyse»)Es sólo una chimenea. Recuerdo que pequeño me
acercaba para calentarme, después de haber
estado todo el día fuera en invierno.\c"
MSs002c026,"\h(«Vyse»)Un jarro de agua para cocinar.
Todos cogemos agua del pozo, por lo que
necesitamos jarras para guardarla.\c"
MSs002c027,"\h(«Vyse»)Un pañuelo para la cabeza…… Una camisa de
rayas…… Está lleno de ropa vieja. Supongo que la
gente coge mucho cariño a sus cosas……\c"
MSs002c028,"\h(«Vyse»)Después de un largo viaje, no hay nada
como quedarte tieso en tu cama.
Es lo mejor del mundo.\c"
MSs002c029,"\h(«Vyse»)El anciano siempre está navegando por ahí,
así que no ha usado casi su cama.
Parece casi nueva.\c"
MSs002c030,"\h(«Vyse»)Ésta es nuestra chimenea. Mi madre la utiliza
todos los días para cocinar para ella……
y para nosotros cuando estamos en casa.\c"
MSs002c031,"\h(«Vyse»)Es mi cama. Pero últimamente he estado
navegando mucho con mi padre, así que no
la he usado mucho.\c"
MSs002c032,"\h(«Vyse»)Es un libro que cogimos en uno de nuestros
asaltos. Los libros no se encuentran así como
así, por eso son muy preciados.\e"
MSs002c033,"\h(«Vyse»)Una vez leí un libro sobre el arte de navegar.
Lo leí tantas veces, que la portada debe de
estar toda gastada. Espero recordar algo……\c"
MSs002c034,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Uy! He dejado mis papeles por todas partes.
Me sorprende que mi madre no me ha echado
la charla por el desorden.\e"
MSs002c035,"\h(«Vyse»)Bueno, sólo estaba estudiando las estrellas.
Supongo que debería estar contenta de que
no esté cruzado de brazos sin hacer nada.\c"
MSs002c036,"\h(«Vyse»)Dice “Isla del Molino”. Es el nombre de esta
isla en casi todos los mapas. Pero los que viven
aquí no la llaman así.\e"
MSs002c037,"\h(«Vyse»)El verdadero nombre de este sitio es “Isla del
Pirata”. Isla del Molino es sólo la tapadera
para burlar al Imperio Valuan.\c"
MSs002c038,"\h(«Vyse»)Este es nuestro pozo. Tiene mucho valor para
nosotros en la Isla del Pirata. Una vez, cuando
éramos pequeños, Aika se cayó en él……\c"
MSs002c039,"\h(«Vyse»)Las mujeres del pueblo utilizan estas cajas
para sentarse, mientras sacan agua del pozo.
Es como la zona de cotilleos de la ciudad.\c"
MSs002c040,"\h(«Vyse»)Cuando era pequeño siempre me subía a este
árbol. Quedó destruido durante el ataque
de la Armada y tuvieron que cortarlo.\c"
MSs002c041,"\h(«Vyse»)Oye…… Parece que alguien ha vuelto a plantar
todas las flores que quedaron destruidas
durante el ataque de la Armada.\c"
MSs002c042,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay una brisa continua en esta región, por eso
la ropa se seca muy rápido.\c"
MSs002c043,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay una brisa continua en esta región, por eso
la ropa se seca muy rápido.\c"
MSs002c044,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Éste no es el cubo de la colada?
¿Quién lo ha dejado ahí tirado?\c"
MSs002c049,\h( )“No pises en el jardín.”\e
MSs002c045,"\h(«Vyse»)…… Las verduras son una fuente de nutrientes
importante para los marineros. Todos nos
preocupamos de que crezcan bien.\c"
MSs002c046,"\h(«Vyse»)Éste es nuestro incinerador. Está conectado a la
chimenea por dentro. Así, los dos pueden usar la
misma salida.\c"
MSs002c047,"\h(«Vyse»)Es fácil coger escorbuto cuando navegas. Cuesta
mucho encontrar verduras, por eso los nabos en
vinagre son tan importantes.\c"

MC0190000,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse… Aika…
Captain Drachma…\e"
MC0190001,\h(«Fina»)I… just wanted to tell you how much I… I…\e
MC0190002,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… don't worry about it. The Valuans went 
through a lot of trouble to capture you. We just
like making them mad.\e"
MC0190003,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse is just kidding, Fina. You're our friend
now. But while we were there, I did want to grab
some more loot…\e"
MC0190004,"\h(«Vyse»)What? Aika! You wanted to stay in Valua!? 
We barely made it out of there!\e"
MC0190005,"\h(«Aika»)Hey! It's an Air Pirate's duty to liberate any 
treasure that can help the needy.\e"
MC0190006,"\h(«Vyse»)Umm…
Fina… there's something I want to ask you…
What is this mission that you're on?\e"
MC0190007,"\h(«Vyse»)What are you looking for? And why is the Valuan 
Empire after you? We might be able to help…\e"
MC0190008,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MC0190009,\h(«Fina»)…Alright. I'll tell you…\e
MC0190010,"\h(«Fina»)I am a Silvite, a descendant of the Silver 
Civilization.\e"
MC0190011,\h(«Aika»)Silver Civilization?\e
MC0190012,"\h(«Fina»)Hundreds of generations ago, the world's 
population was divided into 6 civilizations.\e"
MC0190013,"\h(«Fina»)One existed under each of the Moons
in the sky… Green, Red, Blue, Purple, Yellow,
and Silver.\e"
MC0190014,"\h(«Fina»)Each civilization harnessed the power of its 
moon by learning how to use Moon Stones as a 
source of energy.\e"
MC0190015,"\h(«Fina»)The entire world went through a technological 
revolution. But technology advanced faster than
the people wielding it.\e"
MC0190016,"\h(«Fina»)The leaders of each of the civilizations became
corrupt… and their ambition led them to war.
They used their technology to create weapons.\e"
MC0190017,"\h(«Fina»)These weapons were called “Gigas.” They were 
gigantic living weapons that were capable of 
destroying whole islands.\e"
MC0190018,"\h(«Aika»)I've heard about these Gigas before.
There's a giant, and a dragon…\e"
MC0190019,"\h(«Aika»)But, I thought those were all tales parents told
their children… I never thought that they were 
real.\e"
MC0190020,"\h(«Fina»)Oh, Aika, they are very real. When the Ancient 
Civilizations went to war, they unleashed the 
Gigas on each other. So many people died…\e"
MC0190021,"\h(«Fina»)Then something happened…
the Rains of Destruction fell…
No one knows exactly what caused it…\e"
MC0190022,"\h(«Fina»)Moon Stones fell from each of the Moons… They
fell for what seemed like an eternity. Thousands
of Stones fell at a time… Like a rainstorm…\e"
MC0190023,"\h(«Fina»)It was almost as if the Moons wanted to make
sure that their powers would never be misused
again. Millions died in the Rains…\e"
MC0190024,"\h(«Fina»)The stones battered the lands and leveled the 
cities… All of the Ancient Civilizations were 
destroyed. Only a few survivors remained.\e"
MC0190025,"\h(«Fina»)But even if the Rains of Destruction never 
happened, the Gigas would have destroyed the 
world anyway.\e"
MC0190026,"\h(«Fina»)Now, there are people who are trying to reawaken
the Gigas.\e"
MC0190027,"\h(«Vyse»)You mean…
The Valuan Empire?\e"
MC0190028,"\h(«Fina»)Yes. But, to command the Gigas, it is necessary 
to find the Moon Crystals. A Moon Crystal is a 
highly concentrated form of Moon Stone.\e"
MC0190029,"\h(«Fina»)The original Moon Crystals used to control the 
Gigas are scattered throughout the world.\e"
MC0190030,"\h(«Fina»)Valua is searching for those Crystals so they 
can reawaken the Gigas!\e"
MC0190031,"\h(«Aika»)And that's why the Valuan Empire kidnapped you…
to find out where they were hidden!\e"
MC0190032,"\h(«Fina»)Yes. I was sent here to gather the Crystals 
before the Valuans could find them and put them 
somewhere where they can never be used again.\e"
MC0190033,"\h(«Fina»)… Vyse… Aika…
I know I have caused you enough trouble, but I 
have another favor to ask of you.\e"
MC0190034,"\h(«Fina»)I would like you to go with me. 
Help me travel the world in search of the 
Crystals.\e"
MC0190035,"\h(«Fina»)Please… without my ship, I can't do it… and if
Valua gets the Crystals… I don't even want to
think about what would happen…\e"
MC0190036,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Leave everything to us!”
“I need to think about this…”\e"
MC0190037,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… leave everything to us!
We'll go with you and find those Crystals!\e"
MC0190038,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah, Vyse… I guess this is your chance to see
what lies beyond the sunset!\e"
MC0190039,"\h(«Vyse»)You're right, Aika…\e"
MC0190040,"\h(«Fina»)Thank you so much!
If you two were to come with me, I would be so 
honored!\e"
MC0190041,"\h(«Vyse»)Let me think about it for a little.
It's all so sudden…\e"
MC0190042,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! What are you talking about!
Stop being such a coward! Valua will find the 
Crystals first if we don't help her!\e"
MC0190043,"\h(«Aika»)And Vyse…
Have you forgotten what you used to always tell 
me?\e"
MC0190044,"\h(«Aika»)“One day, I want to see what lies beyond the
sunset”, is what you've been saying since we
were kids! This is your chance!\e"
MC0190045,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah…
Now that you put it that way, I suppose you're 
right…\e"
MC0190046,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright, Fina… we'll help you find those 
Crystals!\e"
MC0190047,"\h(«Fina»)Thank you so much! If you two were to come with 
me, I'd be so honored!\e"
MC0190048,"\h(«Aika»)Huh?
Vyse, what was that noise? 
Was that your stomach?\e"
MC0190049,"\h(«Fina»)Oh… I'm sorry. 
It's okay, you can come out now.\e"
MC0190050,\h(«Vyse»)Huh…?!\e
MC0190051,"\h(«Aika»)Wh… what is that thing?!
Where'd it come from?\e"
MC0190052,\h(«Fina»)It's been with me ever since I was a baby.\e
MC0190053,"\h(«Fina»)It's from my homeland… It can change its
shape… And it's usually shaped like a bracelet
around my arm.\e"
MC0190054,"\h(«Aika»)Heh… actually, the thing is kind of cute. 
What's its name?\e"
MC0190055,"\h(«Aika»)It's so cute! I'm very pleased to meet you, 
Cupil!\e"
MC0190056,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, Fina, we've got a long journey ahead of 
us. We'll do our best to help you get the 
Crystals.\e"
MC0190057,\h(«Fina»)Thank you… I'm so glad that you're helping me.\e
MC0190058,"\h(«Aika»)Now, the only problem left is Cap'n Dyne… 
I wonder if he'll let us go.\e"
MC0190059,"\h(«Vyse»)What are you worried about? Even if he does say 
no, we'll just go anyway!\e"
MC0190060,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright!
Once we're finished getting everything ready, 
we'll leave from the underground port!\e"
MC0190061,"\h(«Fina»)Its name is Cupil. Come, Cupil… say hello to 
everyone.\e"
MC0190062,\h( )Fina has joined your party!\e
MC0190063,\h( )You received the “Silver Moon Stone” from Fina.\e
MFC0190000,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse…… Aika……
Capitaine Drachma……\e"
MFC0190001,\h(«Fina»)Je…… voulais juste vous dire combien je…… je……\e
MFC0190002,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé…… Ne t'en fait pas. Les Valuans ont eu
beaucoup de difficultés à te capturer.
Nous, cela nous amuse de les faire enrager.\e"
MFC0190003,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse plaisante, Fina. Tu es notre amie
maintenant. Mais tant que nous étions là-bas,
j'aurais voulu ramasser un plus gros butin……
Dommage que nous soyons partis si tôt……\e"
MFC0190004,"\h(«Vyse»)Quoi ? Aika ! Tu voulais rester à Valua !?
Nous nous sommes échappés de justesse !\e"
MFC0190005,"\h(«Aika»)Hé ! C'est le devoir d'un Pirate de l'Air de
libérer les trésors qui peuvent aider les
plus démunis.\e"
MFC0190006,"\h(«Vyse»)Umm…… Fina…… je voulais te demander quelque
chose…… En quoi consiste ta mission ?\e"
MFC0190007,"\h(«Vyse»)Que cherches-tu ?
Et pourquoi l'Empire Valuan te recherche ?
Nous pouvons peut-être t'aider……\e"
MFC0190008,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MFC0190009,\h(«Fina»)……Entendu. Je vais vous le dire……\e
MFC0190010,"\h(«Fina»)Je suis une Silvite, une descendante de la
Civilisation d'Argent.\e"
MFC0190011,\h(«Aika»)Civilisation d'Argent ?\e
MFC0190012,"\h(«Fina»)Il y a des centaines de générations de cela, le
monde était divisé en 6 civilisations.\e"
MFC0190013,"\h(«Fina»)Il en existait une sous chaque Lune dans le
ciel…… Verte, Rouge, Bleue, Mauve, Jaune, et
Argent.\e"
MFC0190014,"\h(«Fina»)Chaque civilisation exploitait le pouvoir de sa
lune en apprenant à se servir des Pierres de
Lune comme source d'énergie.\e"
MFC0190015,"\h(«Fina»)Le monde entier a connu une révolution
technologique. Mais cette technologie s'est
développée plus vite que ceux qui s'en
servaient.\e"
MFC0190016,"\h(«Fina»)Les chefs de chaque civilisation ont été
corrompus…… et leur ambition les a menés à la
guerre. Ils se sont servis de leur technologie
pour créer des armes.\e"
MFC0190017,"\h(«Fina»)Ils ont appelé ces armes “Gigas”. C'étaient des
armes vivantes gigantesques, capables de
détruire des îles entières.\e"
MFC0190018,"\h(«Aika»)J'ai déjà entendu parler de ces Gigas.
Il y a un géant, et un dragon……\e"
MFC0190019,"\h(«Aika»)Mais, je croyais que c'était des histoires que
les parents racontaient à leurs enfants……
Je n'ai jamais vraiment cru à leur existence.\e"
MFC0190020,"\h(«Fina»)Oh, Aika, ils existent vraiment. Lorsque les
Civilisations Anciennes sont entrées en guerre,
elles ont laché leurs Gigas les unes contre les
autres. Il y a eu tellement de morts……\e"
MFC0190021,"\h(«Fina»)Puis il s'est passé quelque chose…… la Pluie de
la Destruction est tombée… Personne n'en connaît
la cause exacte…\e"
MFC0190022,"\h(«Fina»)Des Pierres de Lune sont tombées des 6 Lunes……
Cela a duré une éternité…… Des milliers de
Pierres sont tombées à la fois…… Comme une pluie
torrentielle……\e"
MFC0190023,"\h(«Fina»)On aurait dit que les Lunes voulaient s'assurer
que plus personne n'abuserait de leurs pouvoirs.
Des millions de gens périrent sous cette Pluie……\e"
MFC0190024,"\h(«Fina»)Les pierres ont ravagé les terres et rasé les
villes…… Toutes les Anciennes Civilisations ont
été détruites. Il n'y a eu qu'une poignée de
survivants.\e"
MFC0190025,"\h(«Fina»)Mais même si la Pluie de la Destruction n'était
jamais tombée, les Gigas auraient détruit le
monde de toute façon.\e"
MFC0190026,"\h(«Fina»)Aujourd'hui, il y a des gens qui essaient de
faire renaître les Gigas.\e"
MFC0190027,"\h(«Vyse»)Vous voulez dire……
L'Empire Valuan ?\e"
MFC0190028,"\h(«Fina»)Oui. Mais, pour commander les Gigas, il faut
trouver les Cristaux de Lune. Un Cristal de Lune
est une forme très concentrée de Pierre de Lune.\e"
MFC0190029,"\h(«Fina»)Les Cristaux de Lune originaux, qui servent à
contrôler les Gigas, sont dispersés dans le
monde entier.\e"
MFC0190030,"\h(«Fina»)Valua cherche ces Cristaux pour pouvoir faire
renaître les Gigas !\e"
MFC0190031,"\h(«Aika»)Voilà pourquoi l'Empire Valuan  t'a
kidnappée…… pour découvrir où ils se cachent !\e"
MFC0190032,"\h(«Fina»)Oui. J'ai été envoyée ici pour réunir les
Cristaux avant que les Valuans ne les trouvent
et pour les mettre en lieu sûr.\e"
MFC0190033,"\h(«Fina»)…… Vyse…… Fina……
Je sais que je vous ai causé assez de problèmes
comme ça, mais j'ai un autre service à vous
demander.\e"

Aidez-moi à parcourir le monde à la recherche
des Cristaux.\e"

Nous venons avec toi et trouverons ces
Cristaux !\e"
MFC0190038,"\h(«Aika»)D'accord, Vyse…… Je suppose que c'est notre
chance de voir ce qui se cache derrière le
coucher du soleil !\e"

Si vous veniez avec moi, je serais vraiment
honorée !\e"
MFC0190041,"\h(«Vyse»)Laisse-moi y réfléchir un petit peu.
C'est si soudain……\e"

Arrête de jouer les lâches ! Valua trouvera les
Cristaux en premier si nous ne l'aidons pas !\e"

As-tu oublié ce que tu me répétais sans cesse ?\e"
MFC0190044,"\h(«Aika»)“Un jour, je veux voir ce qui se cache derrière

raison……\e"

ces Cristaux !\e"

serais très honorée !\e"
MFC0190048,"\h(«Aika»)Hein ?
Vyse, c'était quoi ce bruit ?
Ton estomac ?\e"
MFC0190049,"\h(«Fina»)Oh…… Je suis désolée.
C'est bon, tu peux sortir maintenant.\e"
MFC0190050,\h(«Vyse»)Hein……?!\e

D'où vient-il ?\e"
MFC0190052,\h(«Fina»)Il m'accompagne depuis que je suis bébé.\e
MFC0190053,"\h(«Fina»)Il vient de ma terre natale…… Il peut changer de
forme…… Et en principe il prend la forme d'un
bracelet que je mets à mon poignet.\e"

Comment s'appelle t-il ?\e"

connaissance, Cupil !\e"
MFC0190056,"\h(«Vyse»)Bon, Fina, un long voyage nous attend.
Nous ferons tout notre possible pour t'aider
à retrouver les Cristaux.\e"
MFC0190057,\h(«Fina»)Merci…… Je suis si contente que vous m'aidiez.\e
MFC0190058,"\h(«Aika»)Maintenant, notre seul problème, c'est Cap'taine
Dyne…… Je me demande s'il nous laissera partir.\e"
MFC0190059,"\h(«Vyse»)Pourquoi t'inquiètes-tu ?
Nous partirons même s'il dit non !\e"
MFC0190060,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est d'accord ! Une fois que nous aurons
terminé tous les préparatifs, nous partirons de
l'île !\e"
MFC0190061,"\h(«Fina»)Il s'appelle Cupil. Viens, Cupil…… dis bonjour à
tout le monde.\e"
MFC0190062,\h( )Fina vous a rejoint !\e
MFC0190063,\h( )Fina vous a donné la “Pierre de Lune Argent”.\e
MGC0190000,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse……  Aika……
Captain Drachma……\e"
MGC0190001,"\h(«Fina»)Ich……  wollte euch nur sagen, wie sehr ich……\e"
MGC0190002,"\h(«Vyse»)He…… mach dir keine Gedanken. Die Valuaner
hatten ihre Mühe, dich zu kriegen. Es macht uns
einfach Spaß, sie zu reizen.\e"
MGC0190003,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse macht nur Spaß, Fina. Du bist jetzt unsere
Freundin. Aber als wir dort waren, hätte ich
gern noch etwas mehr Beute eingesteckt. Schade,
dass wir schon so bald wegfahren mussten……\e"
MGC0190004,"\h(«Vyse»)Was? Aika! Du wolltest in Valua bleiben!?
Wir sind gerade noch so rausgekommen!\e"
MGC0190005,"\h(«Aika»)He! Es ist die Pflicht eines jeden Luftpiraten,
alles an Beute zu ergattern, was den Armen
helfen könnte.\e"
MGC0190006,"\h(«Vyse»)Ähmm……  Fina…… ich wollte dich etwas fragen……
Was ist das für eine Mission, auf der du
dich befindest?\e"
MGC0190007,"\h(«Vyse»)Wonach suchst du? Und warum ist das Valua Empire
hinter dir her? Vielleicht können wir helfen……\e"
MGC0190008,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MGC0190009,"\h(«Fina»)…… OK, ich werd's euch sagen.\e"
MGC0190010,"\h(«Fina»)Ich bin Silviterin, ein Abkömmling der Silver
Civilization.\e"
MGC0190011,\h(«Aika»)Silver Civilization?\e
MGC0190012,"\h(«Fina»)Vor hunderten von Generationen war die Welt
in 6 Zivilisationen unterteilt.\e"
MGC0190013,"\h(«Fina»)Jeweils eine existierte unter den Monden des
Himmels…… Grün, Rot, Blau, Purpur, Gelb und
Silber.\e"
MGC0190014,"\h(«Fina»)Jede Zivilisation machte sich die Macht ihres
Mondes zunutze, indem sie lernte, Moon Stones
als Energiequelle zu verwenden.\e"
MGC0190015,"\h(«Fina»)Die ganze Welt erfuhr eine technologische
Revolution. Aber die Technologie entwickelte
sich schneller als die Leute, die sie
handhabten.\e"
MGC0190016,"\h(«Fina»)Die Anführer jeder der Zivilisationen wurden
korrupt…… und ihre Ambitionen führten zum
Krieg. Sie benutzten ihre Technologie dazu,
Waffen herzustellen.\e"
MGC0190017,"\h(«Fina»)Diese Waffen wurden “Gigas” genannt. Es waren
gigantische lebendige Waffen, die in der Lage
waren, ganze Inseln zu zerstören.\e"
MGC0190018,"\h(«Aika»)Von diesen Gigas habe ich schon gehört.
Es gibt einen Riesen, und einen Drachen……\e"
MGC0190019,"\h(«Aika»)Ich habe aber immer geglaubt, dass das
Ammenmärchen sind…… Ich hätte nie gedacht,
dass sie wahr sind.\e"
MGC0190020,"\h(«Fina»)Ach, Aika, sie sind nur zu wahr. Als die
Ancient Civilizations in den Krieg zogen,
ließen sie die Gigas gegeneinander los.
So viele Menschen starben……\e"
MGC0190021,"\h(«Fina»)Dann ist etwas passiert. Der Rain of Destruction
fiel…… Niemand weiß genau, was ihn verursacht
hat……\e"
MGC0190022,"\h(«Fina»)Von jedem der sechs Monde fielen Moon Stones……
Sie fielen, so schien es, für eine Ewigkeit……
Tausende von Steinen fielen auf einmal……
wie ein stürmischer Regen……\e"
MGC0190023,"\h(«Fina»)Es war fast so, als wollten die Monde sicher-
stellen, dass ihre Macht nie wieder missbraucht
würde. Millionen kamen bei diesem Regen um……\e"
MGC0190024,"\h(«Fina»)Die Steine zertrümmerten das Land und machten
die Städte dem Erdboden gleich…… Alle Ancient
Civilizations wurden zerstört. Es gab nur eine
Hand voll Überlebende.\e"
MGC0190025,"\h(«Fina»)Aber wenn es den Rain of Destruction nie
gegeben hätte, hätten die Gigas die
Welt zerstört.\e"
MGC0190026,"\h(«Fina»)Jetzt gibt es Leute, die die Gigas wieder zum
Leben erwecken wollen.\e"
MGC0190027,"\h(«Vyse»)Meinst du……
Das Reich der Valua?\e"
MGC0190028,"\h(«Fina»)Aber um die Gigas beherrschen zu können, muss
man erst die Moon Crystals finden. Ein Moon
Crystal ist eine hoch konzentrierte Form von
Moon Stone.\e"
MGC0190029,"\h(«Fina»)Die ursprünglichen Moon Crystals, mit denen die
Gigas kontrolliert wurden, sind über die ganze
Welt verstreut.\e"
MGC0190030,"\h(«Fina»)Valua sucht nach diesen Kristallen, damit es
die Gigas wieder zum Leben erwecken kann!\e"
MGC0190031,"\h(«Aika»)Und deshalb entführte dich das Reich der Valua……
um herauszufinden, wo sie versteckt sind!\e"
MGC0190032,"\h(«Fina»)Ja. Ich wurde hierher geschickt, um die
Kristalle einzusammeln, bevor die Valuaner sie
finden konnten und sie an einen Ort zu bringen,
wo sie nie mehr benutzt werden können.\e"
MGC0190033,"\h(«Fina»)…… Vyse……  Aika……
Ich weiß, ich habe euch schon genug Umstände
gemacht, aber ich möchte euch um noch einen
Gefallen bitten.\e"
MGC0190034,"\h(«Fina»)Ich möchte, dass ihr mit mir kommt.
Helft mir, durch die Welt zu reisen und
die Kristalle zu suchen.\e"
MGC0190035,"\h(«Fina»)Bitte…… ohne mein Schiff kann ich das nicht……
und wenn Valua die Kristalle bekommt…… Ich darf
gar nicht dran denken, was dann passiert……\e"
MGC0190036,"\h(«Was wirst du sagen?»)“Lass uns das nur machen!”
“Ich muss darüber nachdenken……”\e"
MGC0190037,"\h(«Vyse»)He…… Lass uns das machen! Wir gehen mit
dir und finden die Kristalle!\e"
MGC0190038,"\h(«Aika»)Tja, Vyse……  Schätze, das ist deine Chance,
zu sehen, was hinter dem Horizont liegt!\e"
MGC0190039,"\h(«Vyse»)Stimmt, Aika……\e"
MGC0190040,"\h(«Fina»)Vielen Dank!
Es ist mir eine große Ehre,
wenn ihr beide mit mir kommt!\e"
MGC0190041,"\h(«Vyse»)Lass mich erst darüber nachdenken.
Das kommt alles so plötzlich.\e"
MGC0190042,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! Was redest du da!
Sei kein Feigling! Valua bekommt
die Kristalle als erstes,
wenn wir ihr nicht helfen!\e"
MGC0190043,"\h(«Aika»)Und Vyse……
Hast du vergessen, was du mir immer erzählt
hast?\e"
MGC0190044,"\h(«Aika»)“Eines Tages möchte ich sehen, was hinter dem
Horizont liegt”, das sagst du, seit wir
klein sind! Dies ist deine Chance!\e"
MGC0190045,"\h(«Vyse»)Tja……
So wie du's sagst,
stimmt das wohl……\e"
MGC0190046,"\h(«Vyse»)OK, Fina…… Wir helfen dir, diese Kristalle
zu finden!\e"
MGC0190047,"\h(«Fina»)Vielen Dank!
Es ist mir eine große Ehre,
wenn ihr beide mit mir kommt!\e"
MGC0190048,"\h(«Aika»)Huch?
Vyse, was war das für ein Geräusch?
War das dein Magen?\e"
MGC0190049,"\h(«Fina»)Oh……  Tut mir Leid.
Schon gut, du kannst jetzt rauskommen.\e"
MGC0190050,\h(«Vyse»)Eh…?!\e
MGC0190051,"\h(«Aika»)Wa…… was ist das denn für ein Ding?!
Wo kommt das her?\e"
MGC0190052,"\h(«Fina»)Ich habe es bei mir, seit ich ein Baby bin.\e"
MGC0190053,"\h(«Fina»)Es ist von zu Hause…… Es kann seine Form
ändern…… Und normalerweise legt es sich wie ein
Armband um meinen Arm.\e"
MGC0190054,"\h(«Aika»)He… das Ding ist eigentlich ganz süß.
Wie heißt es denn?\e"
MGC0190055,"\h(«Aika»)Es ist so süß! Nett, dich kennen zu lernen,
Cupil!\e"
MGC0190056,"\h(«Vyse»)Also, Fina, wir haben eine lange Reise vor uns.
Wir versuchen alles, um dir zu helfen, die
Kristalle zu finden.\e"
MGC0190057,"\h(«Fina»)Danke…… ich bin so froh, dass ihr mir helft.\e"
MGC0190058,"\h(«Aika»)Jetzt haben wir nur noch ein Problem -- Captain
Dyne…… ob er uns wohl weg lässt?\e"
MGC0190059,"\h(«Vyse»)Was macht ihr euch Sorgen? Selbst wenn er nein
sagt, gehen wir trotzdem!\e"
MGC0190060,"\h(«Vyse»)OK! Sobald alle fertig sind, fahren wir vom
Untergrund-Hafen ab!\e"
MGC0190061,"\h(«Fina»)Er heißt Cupil. Komm, Cupil, sag allen
Guten Tag.\e"
MGC0190062,\h( )Fina ist zu deiner Gruppe gestoßen!\e
MGC0190063,"\h( )Du hast den “Silver Moon Stone” von Fina
erhalten.\e"
MSC0190000,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse…… Aika……
Capitán Drachma……\e"
MSC0190001,\h(«Fina»)Yo…… sólo quería decir lo mucho que yo…… yo……\e
MSC0190002,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh…… no te preocupes. Los Valuan pasaron
incontables calamidades para capturarte.
Y nos encanta llevarles la contraria.\e"
MSC0190003,"\h(«Aika»)Lo dice en broma, Fina. Eres nuestra amiga.
Pero mientras estábamos allí, me habría gustado
coger un botín mayor…… Qué pena que tuviéramos
que irnos tan pronto……\e"
MSC0190004,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Qué? ¡Aika! ¿¡Querías quedarte en Valua!?
¡Conseguimos escapar de puro milagro!\e"
MSC0190005,"\h(«Aika»)¡Eh! El deber de todo Pirata Aéreo es coger
cualquier tesoro que pueda servir a los
necesitados.\e"
MSC0190006,"\h(«Vyse»)Esto…… Fina…… quisiera hacerte una pregunta……
¿Cuál es tu misión?\e"
MSC0190007,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Qué estás buscando? ¿Y por qué te persigue el
Imperio Valuan? Quizá te podamos ayudar……\e"
MSC0190008,\h(«Fina»)……\e
MSC0190009,\h(«Fina»)……Muy bien. Os lo voy a decir……\e
MSC0190010,"\h(«Fina»)Soy una Silvite, una descendiente de la
Civilización de Plata.\e"
MSC0190011,\h(«Aika»)¿Civilización de Plata?\e
MSC0190012,"\h(«Fina»)Hace cientos de generaciones, la población
mundial se dividía en 6 civilizaciones.\e"
MSC0190013,"\h(«Fina»)Cada una vivía bajo una de las Lunas……
Verde, Roja, Azul, Púrpura, Amarilla y de Plata.\e"
MSC0190014,"\h(«Fina»)Estas civilizaciones aprovechaban el poder de
sus respectivas Lunas aprendiendo a usar las
Piedras Lunares como fuente de energía.\e"
MSC0190015,"\h(«Fina»)El mundo entero atravesó una revolución
tecnológica. Pero la tecnología avanzó más
deprisa que la gente.\e"
MSC0190016,"\h(«Fina»)Los líderes de estas civilizaciones se volvieron
corruptos…… y su ambición les llevó a la guerra.
Utilizaron su tecnología para crear armas.\e"
MSC0190017,"\h(«Fina»)A estas armas se las llamó “Gigas”.
Eran gigantescas armas con vida propia capaces
de destruir islas enteras.\e"
MSC0190018,"\h(«Aika»)Ya había oído hablar de estos Gigas antes.
Hay un gigante y un dragón……\e"
MSC0190019,"\h(«Aika»)Pero pensé que sólo eran historias que los
padres contaban a sus hijos…… Nunca creí que
fueran reales.\e"
MSC0190020,"\h(«Fina»)Oh, Aika, sí que son verdaderas. Cuando las
Civilizaciones Antiguas fueron a la guerra,
utilizaron los Gigas las unas contra las otras.
Murieron muchas personas……\e"
MSC0190021,"\h(«Fina»)Entonces…… cayó la Lluvia Destructora……
Nadie sabe exactamente la causa……\e"
MSC0190022,"\h(«Fina»)De las Lunas cayeron Piedras Lunares……
Estuvieron cayendo durante una eternidad……
Miles de piedras cayeron a la vez…… Como en una
tormenta……\e"
MSC0190023,"\h(«Fina»)Era como si las Lunas quisieran asegurarse de
que sus poderes no volverían a ser utilizados de
forma equivocada. Durante las Lluvias murieron
millones de personas……\e"
MSC0190024,"\h(«Fina»)Las piedras destrozaron las tierras y arrasaron
las ciudades…… Todas las Civilizaciones Antiguas
fueron destruidas. Muy pocos sobrevivieron.\e"
MSC0190025,"\h(«Fina»)Pero aunque las Lluvias Destructoras no hubieran
caído, los Gigas habrían destruido el mundo de
todas formas.\e"
MSC0190026,"\h(«Fina»)Hay personas que intentan volver a despertar a
los Gigas.\e"
MSC0190027,"\h(«Vyse»)Quieres decir……
¿el Imperio Valuan?\e"
MSC0190028,"\h(«Fina»)Sí. Pero para utilizar los Gigas hay que
encontrar los Cristales Lunares. Un Cristal
Lunar es una concentración alta de Piedra
Lunar.\e"
MSC0190029,"\h(«Fina»)Los Cristales Lunares que originalmente servían
para controlar los Gigas están repartidos por
todo el mundo.\e"
MSC0190030,"\h(«Fina»)¡Valua busca esos Cristales para poder despertar
a los Gigas!\e"
MSC0190031,"\h(«Aika»)Por eso el Imperio Valuan te secuestró……
¡para descubrir dónde están escondidos!\e"
MSC0190032,"\h(«Fina»)Sí. Me enviaron aquí para reunir los Cristales
antes de que los Valuan los encontraran.
Debo guardarlos en un lugar donde no puedan
utilizarse nunca más.\e"
MSC0190033,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse…… Aika……
Sé que ya os he causado bastantes problemas,
pero tengo que pediros otro favor.\e"
MSC0190034,"\h(«Fina»)Me gustaría que vinierais conmigo.
Que me ayudárais a recorrer el mundo en busca de
los Cristales.\e"
MSC0190035,"\h(«Fina»)Por favor…… sin mi barco no puedo hacerlo……
y si Valua encuentra los Cristales……
No quiero ni pensar lo que pasaría……\e"
MSC0190036,"\h(«¿Qué dirías?»)“¡Déjanoslo a nosotros!”
“¡Tengo que pensármelo……!”\e"
MSC0190037,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh…… ¡Déjanoslo a nosotros!
¡Iremos contigo y encontraremos esos Cristales!\e"
MSC0190038,"\h(«Aika»)Sí, Vyse…… ¡Creo que ésta es tu oportunidad para
descubrir qué hay más allá de la puesta de sol!\e"
MSC0190039,"\h(«Vyse»)Claro que sí, Aika……\e"
MSC0190040,"\h(«Fina»)¡Muchas gracias!
¡Es un honor que los dos queráis acompañarme!\e"
MSC0190041,"\h(«Vyse»)Deja que me lo piense un momento.
Es tan repentino……\e"
MSC0190042,"\h(«Aika»)¡Vyse! ¡Pero qué dices!
¡Deja de ser un cobarde! ¡Valua va a encontrar
esos Cristales antes que nosotros!\e"
MSC0190043,"\h(«Aika»)Y Vyse……
¿has olvidado lo que me decías siempre?\e"
MSC0190044,"\h(«Aika»)“Algún día veré lo que hay más allá del
atardecer”, ¡es lo que siempre has dicho desde
que éramos niños! ¡Ésta es tu oportunidad!\e"
MSC0190045,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí……
Ahora que lo dices, supongo que tienes razón……\e"
MSC0190046,"\h(«Vyse»)Muy bien, Fina…… ¡Te ayudaremos a encontrar esos
Cristales!\e"
MSC0190047,"\h(«Fina»)¡Muchas gracias! ¡Será un honor que los dos
decidierais acompañarme!\e"
MSC0190048,"\h(«Aika»)¿Eh?
Vyse, ¿qué ha sido ese ruido?
¿Eran tus tripas?\e"
MSC0190049,"\h(«Fina»)Oh…… Lo siento.
Está bien, ya puedes salir.\e"
MSC0190050,\h(«Vyse»)¡¿Qué……?!\e
MSC0190051,"\h(«Aika»)¡¿Qué…… qué es eso?!
¿De dónde ha salido?\e"
MSC0190052,\h(«Fina»)Lo llevo conmigo desde que era una niña.\e
MSC0190053,"\h(«Fina»)Viene de mi país…… Puede cambiar de forma……
Normalmente tiene la forma de una pulsera que
llevo en el brazo.\e"
MSC0190054,"\h(«Aika»)Eh…… en realidad, es bastante gracioso.
¿Cómo se llama?\e"
MSC0190055,"\h(«Aika»)¡Es tan mono! ¡Encantada de conocerte, Cupil!\e"
MSC0190056,"\h(«Vyse»)Bueno, Fina, tenemos un largo viaje por delante.
Haremos todo lo que podamos para ayudarte a
encontrar los Cristales.\e"
MSC0190057,\h(«Fina»)Gracias…… Estoy tan contenta de que me ayudéis.\e
MSC0190058,"\h(«Aika»)El único problema ahora es el Capitán Dyne……
No sé si nos dejará irnos.\e"
MSC0190059,"\h(«Vyse»)¿De qué te preocupas? Da igual que diga que no,
¡nos vamos y ya está!\e"
MSC0190060,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Muy bien!
¡Una vez que hayamos terminado y esté todo
listo, partiremos desde el puerto del subsuelo!\e"
MSC0190061,"\h(«Fina»)Se llama Cupil. Vamos, Cupil…… saluda a todos.\e"
MSC0190062,\h( )｡Fina se ha unido al grupo!\e
MSC0190063,\h( )Has recibido la “Piedra Lunar de Plata” de Fina.\e
