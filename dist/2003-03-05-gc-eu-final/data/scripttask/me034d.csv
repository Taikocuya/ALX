M00040000,"\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!
Pow pow!\c"
M01110000,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to go to Crescent Isle, right?
It's to the north of Nasr.
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110001,"\h(«Lawrence»)Esparanza is to the south of Nasr.
Do you want to take the wheel now?\e"
M01110002,"\h(«Lawrence»)There should be a calm spot somewhere in the
Dark Rift… we should be able to get through
there. Do you want to take the wheel now?\e"
M01110003,"\h(«Lawrence»)If we continue to the northeast from here, we
should reach Yafutoma… Do you want to take the
wheel?\e"
M01110004,"\h(«Lawrence»)I'll take it from here.
You better hurry up and get on deck.\c"
M01110005,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to head to the Land of Ice, right?
I believe it's south of South Ocean.
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110006,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to go beneath Valua?
Sure… do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110007,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to go to Dangral Island? It's beneath 
the clouds to the southwest of Sailors' Island, 
right? Do you want to take the wheel then?\e"
M01110008,"\h(«Lawrence»)Beneath the Great Cloud Sea by the vortex near 
Shrine Island, right?
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110009,"\h(«Lawrence»)Go to Sailors' Island?
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110010,"\h(«Lawrence»)We have to go to the island that appeared in
Mid Ocean, right? Do you want to take the wheel 
now?\e"
M01110011,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
M01110012,"\h(«Lawrence»)Alright. Here, take the wheel.\c"
M01110013,\h(«Lawrence»)I see.\c
M01110014,"\h(«Lawrence»)If I had known how big this job was going to be,
I would've asked for more than 10,000 gold…\e"
M01110015,"\h(«Lawrence»)So, do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M01110016,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
M01110017,"\h(«Lawrence»)Alright, I leave the ship in your hands, 
Captain Vyse.\c"
M01110018,"\h(«Lawrence»)Very well then. I will continue flying the ship
for now. You should probably go around and talk
to the rest of the crew.\c"
M01140002,"\h(«Pinta»)Esparanza was a rather prosperous city…
Until Valua abandoned it.\e"
M01140003,"\h(«Pinta»)Since then, all trade with Esparanza stopped. 
The place is full of rusted metal and sailors 
who've lost all hope.\c"
M01140004,"\h(«Pinta»)When Esparanza was at its peak, there were
travelers coming from all over, tempting fate,
trying to pass through the Dark Rift.\e"
M01140005,"\h(«Pinta»)And I've heard that there were plenty of thieves
and crooked merchants that gathered there, as
well, to prey upon the optimistic sailors.\c"
M01140006,"\h(«Pinta»)We made it through the Dark Rift! I can search 
for items in this part of the world now, too!\c"
M01140007,"\h(«Pinta»)In Valua, there was once a scholar that claimed 
the world was round. However, he was shunned as 
a lunatic by some, and a heretic by others.\c"
M01140008,"\h(«Pinta»)So, in order to prove his theory, the scholar 
set out to sail around the world… but he was 
killed in the Dark Rift.\c"
M01140009,"\h(«Pinta»)I've heard that the Nasultan sends a personal
retainer to the Lands of Ice once a year to
bring back as much ice as he can.\e"
M01140010,"\h(«Pinta»)Having ice in Nasr is the ultimate luxury. Only 
the Nasultan himself is rich enough to actually
enjoy it… and that's only once a year.\c"
M01140011,"\h(«Pinta»)The temple at the Maw of Tartas is probably the
biggest mystery in all of Valua.\e"
M01140012,"\h(«Pinta»)There are stories of earthquakes on that part of
the island. But if the island is floating, what
is causing it to shake?\c"
M01140013,"\h(«Pinta»)I've heard stories that Valua is building some 
sort of elevator to reach below the Great Cloud 
Sea.\e"
M01140014,"\h(«Pinta»)However, nobody knows where that elevator 
actually stops… or how deep it actually goes.\c"
M01140015,"\h(«Pinta»)People say all sorts of things about the world
under the clouds. Some say it's the land of the
dead, others say that it's a land of pure gold.\e"
M01140016,"\h(«Pinta»)But, nobody has actually ever seen Deep Sky 
before. It's all a big mystery.\c"
M01140017,"\h(«Pinta»)The Valuans promised a reward for anyone who 
could find Enrique and safely take him back… 
Valuan Bounty Hunters were searching for him.\e"
M01140018,"\h(«Pinta»)But, nobody expected him to come back of his own
accord. The Bounty Hunters were upset, to say
the least.\c"
M01140019,"\h(«Pinta»)So, there really is a shrine far above the sky?\e"
M01140020,"\h(«Pinta»)Heh… Not even I knew about that. I'd really
like to see it once with my own eyes!\c"
M01140021,"\h(«Pinta»)I can't believe that an island actually rose up 
from beneath the clouds!\c"
M01140022,"\h(«Pinta»)Vyse, if you win this fight and make it home 
safely…\e"
M01140023,"\h(«Pinta»)I will spread tales of your adventures! Everyone
will know of Vyse, the Air Pirate equalled only
by Daccat, himself!\c"
M01140024,"\h(«Pinta»)Enemies are trying to board us?! Oh no!
We need to prepare for battle!\c"
M05100000,"\h(«Hans»)This ship is amazing!
The sheer power required just to propel it must 
be astronomical!\c"
M05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Wow… the exterior of the Delphinus is so
durable that you could probably fly right
through stone reefs or even through glaciers!\c"
M05100002,"\h(«Hans»)That ship… That was Drachma's Little Jack, 
right?\e"
M05100003,"\h(«Hans»)My father was saying that even though the ship
is old, it is well loved and well taken care of.
He said it was a very good ship.\c"
M05100004,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse, let's explore everywhere we can! Now that 
we can go to high and low altitudes, we should 
take as much advantage of it as possible!\e"
M05100005,"\h(«Hans»)I really can't wait to see how the newly 
upgraded Delphinus will perform!\c"
M05100006,"\h(«Hans»)You got a hold of the Valuan schematics for the
new engine? Wow, I'd really like to take a look
at those!\c"
M05100007,"\h(«Hans»)I can't wait to see what lies beneath the Great
Cloud Sea! Let's hurry up and test the
submerging capabilities of the Delphinus!\c"
M05100008,"\h(«Hans»)It's a little disheartening to think that once
we return, Enrique will be leaving us to go back
to Valua…\c"
M05100009,"\h(«Hans»)So, Fina's ship can reach great altitudes, 
right? I wonder what kind of engine it uses…\c"
M05100010,"\h(«Hans»)I wonder how much power was required to raise
Soltis out of Deep Sky.\c"
M05100011,"\h(«Hans»)There was a bright light that came from that 
island! I wonder what the source of the light 
was…\c"
M05100012,"\h(«Hans»)The Delphinus is completely repaired! Let's go, 
Captain Vyse!\c"
M07060000,"\h(«Don»)We should probably head back to Crescent Isle.
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
M07060001,"\h(«Don»)Hmm… The Land of Ice should be a little farther
south than South Ocean. Do you want to take the
wheel now?\e"
M07060002,"\h(«Don»)We were supposed to head over to Valua and check
out what's beneath it, right? Maybe you should
take the wheel now…\e"
M07060003,"\h(«Don»)Dangral Island should be beneath the clouds to 
the southwest of Sailors' Island. You want to
take the wheel now?\e"
M07060004,"\h(«Don»)The vortex that will take us into Deep Sky is
near Shrine Island, right? That means it should
be somewhere in Mid Ocean.\e"
M07060005,"\h(«Don»)Sailors' Island is in Mid Ocean, right? So, 
Captain… do you want to take the wheel now?\e"
M07060006,"\h(«Don»)You mean we're going to that island that 
appeared in Mid Ocean? Oh man… 
I've got a bad feeling about this…\e"
M07060007,"\h(«Don»)Well, then. I'll be relaxing downstairs in the 
mess hall. I leave the ship in your hands, Vyse.\c"
M07060008,"\h(«Don»)Heh… Well, I guess that means I can fly the
ship for a little while longer.\c"
M07060009,"\h(«Don»)We're going to fly into that island, right? Do
you want to take the wheel then, Captain Vyse?\c"
M07060010,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship a little longer.”\e"
M07060011,"\h(«Don»)Alright then. Good luck, Captain!\c"
M07060012,"\h(«Don»)Alright, I'll take care of the ship for now. Go
down and talk with the rest of the crew then.\c"
M08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)I… I don't know much about sailing, or even the
world outside of Yafutoma…\e"
M08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)… but I promise that I will try my hardest to 
help everyone as much as I can.\c"
M08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)A land totally covered in ice…
I never would have imagined that places like 
that actually existed.\c"
M08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique told me about the man named 
Drachma.\e"
M08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)He has been through so much. I hope he will find
peace.\c"
M08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Although, I know we're not actually going inside
the city of Valua, I still feel nervous… for 
Enrique.\c"
M08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse, you've gathered all of the Moon Crystals! 
Congratulations!\e"
M08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)I am worried about Fina… she doesn't look too 
well. Perhaps she is just tired.\c"
M08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Ever since we returned from Dangral Island, 
Enrique has been so quiet… I hope that he 
is okay…\c"
M08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse… I, I know that I am a member of this crew
and my loyalties lie with you but…\e"
M08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)… there is a part of me that wishes we never 
reach Sailors' Island. I have a feeling that 
something bad is going to happen to Enrique.\c"
M08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique is fighting bravely on his own in
Valua… I, too, must fight and do my best to
help!\c"
M08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)That island that rose up from beneath the clouds
… something is… strange about it. I sense a 
great power coming from the island…\c"
M08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)I, I thought I heard Prince Enrique calling out
just now. I'm sorry, it must be my imagination…
I feel terrible…\e"
M08070014,\h(«Moegi»)Vyse… I know something bad has happened…\c
M08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Let us carry on, Vyse!
I may not be very strong, but I will do my best 
to help fight!\c"
M08070016,"\h(«Brabham»)That Yafutoman book is amazing! I can't believe 
how advanced they are!\e"
M08070023,"\h(«Brabham»)I'll be an expert on this stuff by the time we 
get back from the Land of Ice.\c"
M08070017,"\h(«Brabham»)Now, with the engine specs that I learned from 
the Yafutomans, we can fly all over the damn 
place!\c"
M08070018,"\h(«Brabham»)Hmm… Enrique looks upset. Back in my day, we 
used to pick up on the ladies… They go crazy 
for sailors! That'd cheer us right up! Yessiree!\c"
M08070019,"\h(«Brabham»)Building that Great Cloud Sea Engine was the
hardest thing I've done in a long time! My back
still hurts from all of that hard labor!\e"
M08070020,"\h(«Brabham»)I never thought I'd see an engine that powerful 
in my life… You'd never guess that I'm 147.\c"
M08070021,\h(«Brabham»)That crazy island… it came from Deep Sky!\c
M08070022,"\h(«Brabham»)The Delphinus is running better than ever! 
I love this ship! Ain't it a beaut?\c"
Mp0010003,"\h(«Aika»)This is great, huh Vyse? We can finally make it 
through the sky rifts!\c"
Mp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)I can't believe it! I know there's so much to 
see out there!\c"
Mp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)So, we're trying to get through the Dark Rift,
huh? I wonder what it's really like in there. As
much as I hate to admit it, I'm kinda scared.\c"
Mp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, you did it!
We made it through the Dark Rift!\e"
Mp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)Now we can see what kind of place Yafutoma 
really is! I hope they don't try to eat us with
sticks. Fina better hide Cupil… \e"
Mp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! The enemy's preparing to board us! We need
you on deck fast!\c"
Mp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)The Tenkou, huh?
I guess that even Yafutoma has a little Air 
Pirate problem of their own…\c"
Mp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)If we continue due east from here and we reach 
Crescent Isle, that would only mean one thing…\e"
Mp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)…that the edges of the world are connected!
But, then I suppose they wouldn't really be the
edges of the world…\c"
Mp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)The whole island is frozen! Hehe… one Vysicle 
coming right up! You'd better be careful, 
I didn't bring a chisel.\c"
Mp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)Cap'n Drachma…
I hope he's going to be okay… \c"
Mp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)Well, since we can reach high and low altitudes 
now, we'll be able to go just about anywhere!\c"
Mp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)We've collected all of the Moon Crystals!
Let's hurry up and get back to Crescent Isle!\c"
Mp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)Dangral Island, huh…
It should be beneath the clouds southwest 
of Sailors' Island…\c"
Mp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)I feel so bad for Enrique. He must feel awful. 
I think we should leave him alone for a while.\e"
Mp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)We should be able to go down into Deep Sky 
through the vortex near Shrine Island. Let's go,
Vyse!\c"
Mp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)I guess we have to say our good-byes to Enrique
once we get back to Sailors' Island… I hate
good-byes…\e"
Mp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)If we don't stop Galcian, who knows what'll
happen! Vyse, we have to hurry and get to 
Dangral Island!\c"
Mp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Who would've guessed that there used to be an
island that big in Mid Ocean… And right next to
our very own Pirate Isle…\c"
Mp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse…
We should return to Crescent Isle soon.\e"
Mp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)I hate to admit it, but… I don't think we can
do anything against that island right now.\c"
Mp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)Well, I guess it's time to settle this.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared…\e"
Mp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)But, when I look at how great of a captain
you've become, Vyse, I feel better. Look at how
many people have come to follow you into battle!\e"
Mp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)They all believe in you… they all trust you… 
just like I do. We have to win, right? Captain 
Vyse?\c"
Mp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)The city of Esparanza…
We should head there first. It is located on the
southern tip of Nasr.\c"
Mp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)If we can get through the Dark Rift, the country
of Yafutoma should be on the other side.\c"
Mp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)We've finally made it to the skies of the Blue
Moon… The lands of Yafutoma should be close
by…\c"
Mp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse! It's too dangerous to go out on deck 
without being prepared for battle!\c"
Mp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)It's so strange…
I am a Silvite. I was born and raised in the 
Great Silver Shrine…\e"
Mp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)But, somehow, I feel more at home on Crescent 
Isle than any place else…\c"
Mp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)The Land of Ice…
Somewhere, buried beneath all that ice, lies the
Purple Crystal, I hope we can find it…\c"
Mp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse…
Let us return to Crescent Isle.\c"
Mp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)I never thought we could enter Valua through 
the Maw of Tartas…\c"
Mp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)At last, we have the fifth Crystal!\e"
Mp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)If we can find the blueprints for that Valuan 
ship on Dangral Island, we could make our way 
into Deep Sky and search for my ship…\c"
Mp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique… He's been so quiet lately. I am a 
little concerned about him…\c"
Mp0020014,\h(«Fina»)I was attacked by Valua near Pirate Isle…\e
Mp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)My ship must be somewhere in Deep Sky around 
there.\c"
Mp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique will at last be able to return to his 
homeland…\c"
Mp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez… we must stop him!
We must hurry to Dangral Island!\c"
Mp0020018,\h(«Fina»)Ramirez… I wonder what he's doing on Soltis!\e
Mp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)…!!
No… he, he wouldn't…\c"
Mp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Why, Vyse… Why?\c"
Mp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, let's go!
We've got to go to Soltis!\e"
Mp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)I will fight with you!
Ramirez must be stopped.\c"
Ma0040000,\h(«Pow»)Pow! Pow! Pow!\e
Ma1110000,\h(«Lawrence»)Do you want to take the wheel?\e
Ma1110001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma1110002,"\h(«Lawrence»)Alright, I leave the ship in your hands then.\c"
Ma1110003,\h(«Lawrence»)I see. Very well then.\c
Ma1110004,"\h(«Lawrence»)I've been chased all over by all sorts of
ships… But I've never been chased into Deep Sky
before. Heh… First time for everything I guess.\e"
Ma1110005,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma1110006,"\h(«Lawrence»)Visibility is bad right now. Just be careful 
where you fly.\c"
Ma1110007,\h(«Lawrence»)I see. Very well then.\c
Ma1140000,"\h(«Pinta»)The remains of so many ships are down here. It's
kind of scary when you think about it.\c"
Ma1140001,"\h(«Pinta»)Many adventurers have tried to travel through 
Valua by going through the cracks and fissures 
beneath it.\e"
Ma1140002,"\h(«Pinta»)But their ships couldn't fly low enough to reach
the entrance.\c"
Ma1140003,"\h(«Pinta»)I'm happy to have been one of the chosen few to
see Deep Sky…\e"
Ma1140004,"\h(«Pinta»)But, my one regret is that it was not aboard my
own ship. I suppose you can't have everything…\c"
Ma2000000,"\h(«Marco»)This place gives me the creeps… Let's hurry up
and finish what we came here to do so we can get
out!\c"
Ma2000001,"\h(«Marco»)The city I used to live in is above us right
now. I never thought I'd get out of there…\c"
Ma2000002,"\h(«Marco»)Brabham told me that the reason why we have to
keep the shutters closed while we're down here
is so we don't see the ghosts outside…\e"
Ma2000003,\h(«Marco»)I wonder if there really are ghosts down here…\c
Ma5100000,"\h(«Hans»)This ship is probably the first ship to ever 
make it through the Maw of Tartas. That's quite 
an accomplishment in itself.\c"
Ma5100001,"\h(«Hans»)The engine checks out okay. It's so amazing that
someone actually built a ship of this power and
magnitude! I'm definitely impressed…\c"
Ma5100002,"\h(«Hans»)So, this is the infamous Dark Rift that's
claimed so many lives… And the Delphinus
doesn't even sway in the winds… Amazing…\c"
Ma5210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)There are too many rocks. This place is ugly. 
Maybe that's why Valuans think so many ugly 
thoughts.\c"
Ma5210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)I can't see much. But I sense some very bad 
things here.\c"
Ma5210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)There are a lot of sunken ships down here. I 
wonder if there's a lot of treasure…\c"
Ma7060000,"\h(«Don»)It's so hard to see down here… It's almost 
impossible to tell where we're going. 
Huh? Did you want to take the wheel, Captain?\e"
Ma7060001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma7060002,"\h(«Don»)Alright. Just make sure not to run into anything
and you should be fine.\c"
Ma7060003,"\h(«Don»)Oh well… I guess that means I have to stay here
and keep us alive. Back to work, back to work…\c"
Ma7060004,"\h(«Don»)Visibility is horrible, we don't know where
we're going, and you're still making me fly this
thing!! Hurry up and take the wheel, will ya?\e"
Ma7060005,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma7060006,"\h(«Don»)Thank the Moons! I can finally relax. Just be
careful and don't get us all killed, okay,
Captain?\c"
Ma7060007,"\h(«Don»)What?! Oh, alright… I'll try to keep us alive 
for a little while longer, I guess.\c"
Ma7060008,"\h(«Don»)So, this is what the Dark Rift looks like from 
the inside… So many of my friends met their 
fate here… Maybe you should take the wheel…\e"
Ma7060009,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around the ship some more.”\e"
Ma7060010,"\h(«Don»)Thank you, Vyse. I'll be down in the galley. 
This is a little hard for me to deal with…\c"
Ma7060011,"\h(«Don»)Alright, Captain… I'll try my best.\c"
Ma8070000,"\h(«Moegi»)It's hard to believe that we are under Prince 
Enrique's homeland right now.\c"
Ma8070001,"\h(«Moegi»)In Yafutoma, there are tales of demons that live
beneath the clouds and eat bad children.\e"
Ma8070002,"\h(«Moegi»)But looking at how dark the world is down here,
I can almost believe those children's stories…\c"
Ma8070003,"\h(«Moegi»)This storm… I believe you called it the Dark 
Rift… It is what kept Yafutoma separated from
the rest of the world…\c"
Ma4000000,"\h(«Brabham»)This is probably the only ship in the whole 
world that can survive the trip into Deep Sky.\e"
Ma4000001,"\h(«Brabham»)And just think! The Delphinus is the first ship
to enter the Maw of Tartas, too!!\c"
Ma4000002,"\h(«Brabham»)The engine checks out okay! We're still holding
up strong!\c"
Ma4000003,"\h(«Brabham»)The Dark Rift shouldn't be a problem for the 
Delphinus. We should be able to fly straight 
through!\c"
Ma4050000,"\h(«Domingo»)When I think of the fact that not even the 
Valuans themselves have seen the inside of the 
Maw of Tartas…\e"
Ma4050001,"\h(«Domingo»)… it makes even the walls of this place look… 
valuable, for some reason. Wouldn't you agree, 
Vyse?\c"
Ma4050002,"\h(«Domingo»)Take a look around, Vyse…
Nobody has ever set foot in this place before…
Think about it, we're actually in Deep Sky…\e"
Ma4050003,"\h(«Domingo»)It sort of brings a little color to this 
otherwise drab place, doesn't it? Just think of 
all the sunken treasure that's down here…\c"
Ma4050004,"\h(«Domingo»)There's quite a few sunken ships down here. I 
wonder how many of those ships are Air Pirate 
ships…\e"
Ma4050005,"\h(«Domingo»)Heh… It sort of makes one want to go out and 
search the wreckage for treasure, doesn't it?\c"
Ma4060000,"\h(«Ilchymis»)So, this is the Maw of Tartas, huh?
Heh… I bet the other scientists of Valua would 
worship me if they knew I was actually in here…\c"
Ma4060001,"\h(«Ilchymis»)This place is amazing… The raw energy that 
is brewing in this place is… magnificent.\c"
Ma4060002,"\h(«Ilchymis»)So… this is the infamous Dark Rift. So many 
people have lost their lives in these winds…\c"
Maa010000,"\h(«Aika»)Wow… Look at all of those sunken ships. There 
are probably a lot of ghosts roaming around 
outside… Vyse! Let's get out of here soon!\c"
Maa010001,"\h(«Aika»)If we can make our way through all of these 
crevices, then we should be able to reach the 
area beneath the Great Seal, right?\c"
Maa010002,"\h(«Aika»)We have to find Fina's ship.
When something shows up on the sonar, you have 
to use the claw to try and get it, okay?\c"
Maa010003,"\h(«Aika»)Wow… That thing sure was tough. Let's hurry up 
and find Fina's ship so we can get back to 
Crescent Isle!\c"
Maa010004,"\h(«Aika»)This place sure gives me the creeps… No matter 
how many times we come here. Can we go home now,
Vyse?\c"
Maa010005,"\h(«Aika»)The air down here even looks like it's hard to 
breathe… But, I have to admit that it's kinda 
interesting down here, though.\c"
Maa020000,"\h(«Fina»)If we can safely get through the Dark Rift, the
country of Yafutoma should be somewhere on the
other side.\c"
Maa020001,"\h(«Fina»)It… it saddens me to think of all the brave
sailors that lost their lives in this maelstrom.\c"
Maa020002,"\h(«Fina»)The Yellow Gigas sleeps somewhere in the Maw of 
Tartas…\e"
Maa020003,"\h(«Fina»)If the stories are correct, the Yellow Crystal 
will be embedded into the body of the Yellow 
Gigas. We must use extreme caution…\c"
Maa020004,"\h(«Fina»)It feels a little strange to be flying inside 
the actual island of Valua, doesn't it?\c"
Maa020005,"\h(«Fina»)This… this place is amazing.
I wonder if we'll really be able to find my ship
down here…\c"
Maa020006,"\h(«Fina»)This place frightens me, no matter how many 
times we come here…\c"
Maa040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Ungh… The ship is rocking… so much…
Please don't bother me right now… I… I feel 
rather ill.\c"
Maa040001,"\h(«Enrique»)The Armada couldn't even make it through the
Dark Rift, and here we are…\c"
Maa040002,"\h(«Enrique»)I never dreamed that I would actually be flying 
inside the lands of Valua…\e"
Maa040003,"\h(«Enrique»)I would never have seen sights such as this had 
I remained cooped up in the palace…\c"
Maa040004,"\h(«Enrique»)The view is amazing… I never imagined that a 
world such as this existed beneath the clouds.\e"
Maa040005,"\h(«Enrique»)What is the Armada trying to accomplish by 
building ships that can travel down here? I 
wonder what Galcian is up to…\c"
Maa040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Soon, the battle will be over. We must defeat 
Ramirez and bring peace back to the people of 
this world!\c"
Maa040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, take me with you. Let me go with you into 
Soltis.\e"
Maa040008,"\h(«Will you take Enrique with you?»)“Of course, Enrique.”
“Sorry, but we need you here.”\e"
Maa040009,"\h(«Vyse»)Of course, Enrique.
It would be an honor for you to join us.\e"
Maa040010,"\h(«Enrique»)Thank you, Vyse!
I'll fight to the best of my ability! I will not
let you down…\e"
Maa040011,\h( )Enrique has joined your party.\c
Maa040012,"\h(«Enrique»)I see.
Well, if you change your mind, just let me know.
I am ready to fight at a moment's notice.\c"
Mg0040000,"\h(«Pow»)Pow pow!
Pow pow!\c"
Mg1110000,"\h(«Lawrence»)You want to go to Crescent Isle, right?
Hmm… to the north of Nasr?
Do you want to take the wheel?\e"
Mg1110001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take the wheel.”
“Look around a bit more.”\e"
Mg1110002,\h(«Lawrence»)Very well. I will leave everything to you.\c
Mg1110003,"\h(«Lawrence»)Very well. I will man the helm for a little
while longer.\c"
Mg1140000,"\h(«Pinta»)Prince Enrique's ship was to be the strongest 
boat in the entire Valuan Armada! It was made 
using Valua's newest alloys and technologies!\e"
Mg1140001,"\h(«Pinta»)And not only did you manage to steal the ship, 
Vyse, you also managed to steal the prince away 
from Valua! You've become quite famous!\c"
Mg2000000,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this?
Is something in here?\e"
Mg2000001,"\h(«Marco»)\eYawn\eOh man, it feels so good to finally get out of 
there.\e"
Mg2000002,"\h(«Marco»)Heh… Long time no see, Vyse!\e"
Mg2000003,"\h(«Vyse»)Marco!
What are you doing here?!\e"
Mg2000004,"\h(«Marco»)I heard that the prince's ship was finished and 
was being prepared for departure.\e"
Mg2000005,"\h(«Marco»)So, I snuck on board and I was planning on 
escaping Valua in it.\e"
Mg2000006,"\h(«Marco»)Well, I'd heard that the prince was a really 
nice guy, so I figured he wouldn't kill me for 
trying to escape. Well, at least not right away.\e"
Mg2000007,"\h(«Marco»)But I never would've thought that you, of all
people, would get your hands on this ship! At
least now I don't have to go looking for you!\e"
Mg2000008,"\h(«Marco»)I'm gonna travel along with you whether you like
it or not. But don't worry… I'll stay outta
your way, okay?\e"
Mg2000009,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… You're pretty pushy there, kid. Ah, why 
not… I'll make you my first crew member!\e"
Mg2000010,\h( )Marco has joined your crew as a “Sailor.”\c
Mgg050000,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey, Vyse.
I don't know where it's coming from, but I keep 
hearing this strange noise up here…\e"
Mgg050001,"\h(«Gilder»)I've looked around, but couldn't find where it
was coming from. Maybe you'll have better luck.
Oh, and when you're done, I need to talk to you.\c"
Mgg050002,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey there, Vyse. Have you finished looking 
around the ship? There's something that I need 
to talk to you about.\e"
Mgg050003,"\h(«What do you say?»)“Actually, I'm not quite finished yet.”
“I've pretty much seen everything I wanted to.”\e"
Mgg050004,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, I'm not quite finished looking around 
yet…\e"
Mgg050005,"\h(«Gilder»)That's no problem. Just take your time. But, 
when you're finished, I still need to talk to 
you, okay?\e"
Mgg050006,"\h(«Vyse»)I've pretty much seen everything that I wanted 
to. What did you want to talk to me about?\e"
Mgg050007,"\h(«Gilder»)Well, actually…\e"
Mgg010000,"\h(«Aika»)This Crescent Isle that we're heading towards is
the island that you were stranded on, right? I
can't wait to see what it looks like!\e"
Mgg010001,"\h(«Aika»)But, I still can't believe it… We're actually 
going to have our own headquarters! Just like 
Pirate Isle! Is this exciting or what?!\e"
Mgg010002,"\h(«Aika»)We should just concentrate on saving up 100,000 
gold. Having a base is more important than 
getting the Crystals right away!\c"
Mgg020000,"\h(«Fina»)Haha… I've been curious as to what sort of 
island you were stranded on.\c"
Mgg020001,"\h(«Fina»)We should try and save up some money so that 
Brabham can make the necessary modifications to 
this ship. It shouldn't take that long…\c"
MF00040000,"\h(«Pow»)Pow pow !
Pow pow !\c"
MF01110000,"\h(«Lawrence»)Vous voulez aller sur l'Île Croissant, n'est-ce
pas ? C'est au nord de Nasr.
Voulez-vous prendre la barre ?\e"
MF01110001,"\h(«Lawrence»)Esperanza est au sud de Nasr.
Voulez-vous prendre la barre maintenant ?\e"
MF01110002,"\h(«Lawrence»)Il devrait y avoir un endroit plus calme dans le
Récif Noir…… Nous devrions pouvoir passer par
là-bas. Voulez-vous prendre la barre
maintenant ?\e"
MF01110003,"\h(«Lawrence»)Si nous continuons en direction du nord-est,
nous devrions atteindre Yafutoma…… Voulez-vous
prendre la barre ?\e"
MF01110004,"\h(«Lawrence»)Je prends la relève.
Vous feriez mieux de vous dépêcher de remonter
sur le pont.\c"
MF01110005,"\h(«Lawrence»)Vous voulez aller au Pays des Glaces, n'est-ce
pas ? Je crois que c'est au sud de l'Océan Sud.
Voulez-vous prendre la barre ?\e"
MF01110006,"\h(«Lawrence»)Vous voulez aller sous Valua ? Pas de problème……
Voulez-vous prendre la barre ?\e"
MF01110007,"\h(«Lawrence»)Vous voulez aller sur l'Île Dangral ? Elle se
trouve sous les nuages au sud-ouest de l'Île des
Marins, n'est-ce pas ? Alors voulez-vous prendre
la barre ?\e"
MF01110008,"\h(«Lawrence»)Sous le Grand Océan de Nuages, à côté du vortex,
près de l'Île du Temple, n'est-ce pas ?
Voulez-vous prendre la barre ?\e"
MF01110009,"\h(«Lawrence»)Aller sur l'Île des Marins ?
Voulez-vous prendre la barre ?\e"
MF01110010,"\h(«Lawrence»)Nous devons aller sur l'île qui est apparue dans
l'Océan Central, n'est-ce pas ? Voulez-vous
prendre la barre maintenant ?\e"
MF01110011,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“vous prendrez la barre.”
“Vous inspecterez un peu plus le navire.”\e"
MF01110012,\h(«Lawrence»)Très bien. Prenez la barre.\c
MF01110013,\h(«Lawrence»)Je vois.\c
MF01110014,"\h(«Lawrence»)Si j'avais su qu'il y aurait autant de travail,
j'aurais demandé plus de 10 000 pièces d'or……\e"
MF01110015,"\h(«Lawrence»)Alors, voulez-vous prendre la barre ?\e"
MF01110016,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“vous prendrez la barre.”
“Vous inspecterez un peu plus le navire.”\e"
MF01110017,"\h(«Lawrence»)Très bien, vous êtes maître à bord,
Capitaine Vyse.\c"
MF01110018,"\h(«Lawrence»)Entendu. Je vais rester à la barre pour le
moment. Vous devriez aller parler aux autres
membres de l'équipage.\c"
MF01140002,"\h(«Pinta»)Jadis, Esperanza était une ville très prospère……
Jusqu'à ce que Valua l'abandonne.\e"
MF01140003,"\h(«Pinta»)Depuis ce temps-là, tout commerce avec Esperanza
a cessé. Il ne reste plus que des vieux morceaux
de ferraille et des marins qui ont perdu tout
espoir.\c"
MF01140004,"\h(«Pinta»)Quand Esperanza était à son apogée, les
voyageurs affluaient de partout, tentant le
destin, essayant de traverser le Récif Noir.\e"
MF01140005,"\h(«Pinta»)Et on raconte qu'un tas de voleurs et d'escrocs
s'y retrouvaient aussi pour s'attaquer aux
marins optimistes.\c"
MF01140006,"\h(«Pinta»)Nous avons réussi à traverser le Récif Noir !
Je peux chercher des objets ici aussi
maintenant !\c"
MF01140007,"\h(«Pinta»)Jadis à Valua, vivait un savant qui disait que
le monde était rond. Cependant, certains le
considéraient comme un fou, et d'autres comme un
hérétique.\c"
MF01140008,"\h(«Pinta»)Donc, pour prouver sa théorie, le savant est
parti naviguer autour du monde…… mais il a péri
dans le Récif Noir.\c"
MF01140009,"\h(«Pinta»)J'ai entendu dire que le Nasultan envoie une
fois par an un serviteur aux Pays des Glaces
pour rapporter autant de glace que possible.\e"
MF01140010,"\h(«Pinta»)C'est un luxe à Nasr d'avoir de la glace. Seul
le Nasultan est assez riche pour en profiter……
et ce une seule fois par an.\c"
MF01140011,"\h(«Pinta»)Le temple des Bouches de Tartas est probablement
le plus grand mystère de tout Valua.\e"
MF01140012,"\h(«Pinta»)On raconte qu'il y a des tremblements de terre
par là-bas. Mais si c'est une île flottante,
qu'est-ce qui la fait trembler ?\c"
MF01140013,"\h(«Pinta»)On raconte que Valua est en train de construire
une sorte d'ascenseur sous le Grand Océan de
Nuages.\e"
MF01140014,"\h(«Pinta»)Cependant, personne ne sait où cet ascenseur
s'arrête…… ou à quelle profondeur il va.\c"
MF01140015,"\h(«Pinta»)les gens racontent plein d'histoires au sujet du
monde sous les nuages. Certains disent que c'est
le pays des morts, d'autres disent que c'est un
pays en or pur.\e"
MF01140016,"\h(«Pinta»)Mais, personne n'a jamais vu les Profondeurs.
C'est tout un mystère.\c"
MF01140017,"\h(«Pinta»)Les Valuans ont promis une récompense pour celui
ou celle qui trouvera Enrique et le ramènera
sain et sauf…… Les chasseurs de prime Valuans le
cherchaient.\e"
MF01140018,"\h(«Pinta»)Mais, personne ne s'attendait à ce qu'il
revienne de son plein gré. Les chasseurs de
prime étaient en colère, c'est le moins qu'on
puisse dire.\c"
MF01140019,"\h(«Pinta»)Alors, il existe vraiment un temple haut, très
haut dans le ciel ?\e"
MF01140020,"\h(«Pinta»)Hé…… Même moi je ne le savais pas. J'aimerais
bien le voir au moins une fois de mes propres
yeux !\c"
MF01140021,"\h(«Pinta»)Je n'arrive pas à croire qu'une île ait pu
surgir de sous les nuages !\c"
MF01140022,"\h(«Pinta»)Vyse, si vous gagnez cette bataille et revenez
en un seul morceau……\e"
MF01140023,"\h(«Pinta»)Je raconterai vos aventures partout où j'irai !
Tout le monde connaîtra Vyse, le Pirate de l'Air
égalé uniquement par Daccat, en personne !\c"
MF01140024,"\h(«Pinta»)Des ennemis essaient d'aborder ?! Oh non !
Il faut nous préparer à la bataille !\c"
MF05100000,"\h(«Hans»)Ce navire est incroyable !
La puissance nécessaire pour le propulser doit
être astronomique !\c"
MF05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Oh là là…… la coque du Delphinus est tellement
solide que vous pourriez sûrement traverser des
récifs de pierre ou même des glaciers !\c"
MF05100002,"\h(«Hans»)Ce navire…… c'était bien le Little Jack de
Drachma ?\e"
MF05100003,"\h(«Hans»)Mon père disait que malgré l'ancienneté du
navire, il est aimé et bien entretenu. Il disait
que c'était un très bon navire.\c"
MF05100004,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse, explorons tous les pays que nous n'avons
pas vus ! Maintenant que nous pouvons aller
aussi bas et aussi haut, nous devrions en
profiter autant que possible !\e"
MF05100005,"\h(«Hans»)Il me tarde vraiment de voir les performances du
nouveau Delphinus !\c"
MF05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Vous avez trouvé les plans Valuans du nouveau
moteur ? Oh là là, j'aimerais bien les voir !\c"
MF05100007,"\h(«Hans»)Il me tarde de voir ce qu'il y a sous le Grand
Océan de Nuages ! Dépêchons-nous de tester les
capacités de submersion du Delphinus !\c"
MF05100008,"\h(«Hans»)C'est un peu désolant de penser qu'à notre
retour, Enrique va nous quitter pour rejoindre
Valua……\c"
MF05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Alors, le navire de Fina peut monter à très
haute altitude, n'est-ce pas ? Je me demande
quel moteur il a……\c"
MF05100010,"\h(«Hans»)Je me demande s'il a fallu beaucoup de puissance
pour sortir Soltis des Profondeurs.\c"
MF05100011,"\h(«Hans»)Une lumière vive émanait de cette île !
Je me demande d'où venait cette lumière……\c"
MF05100012,"\h(«Hans»)Le Delphinus est entièrement réparé !
Allons-y, Capitaine Vyse !\c"
MF07060000,"\h(«Don»)Nous devrions probablement retourner sur l'Île
Croissant. Voulez-vous prendre la barre ?\e"
MF07060001,"\h(«Don»)Humm…… Le Pays des Glaces devrait se trouver un
peu plus au sud de l'Océan Sud. Voulez-vous
prendre la barre maintenant ?\e"
MF07060002,"\h(«Don»)Nous devions aller à Valua pour voir ce qu'il y
a dessous, n'est-ce pas ? Vous devriez peut-être
prendre la barre maintenant……\e"
MF07060003,"\h(«Don»)L'Île Dangral devrait se trouver sous les
nuages. Vous voulez prendre la barre
maintenant ?\e"
MF07060004,"\h(«Don»)Le vortex qui nous permettra d'aller dans les
Profondeurs est près de l'Île au Temple, n'est-
ce pas ? Ce qui veut dire qu'il devrait se
trouver dans l'Océan Central.\e"
MF07060005,"\h(«Don»)L'Île des Marins est dans l'Océan Central,
n'est-ce pas ? Alors, Capitaine…… Voulez-vous
prendre la barre maintenant ?\e"
MF07060006,"\h(«Don»)Vous voulez dire que nous allons sur cette île
qui est apparue dans l'Océan Central ? Oh mon
Dieu…… J'ai un mauvais pressentiment……\e"
MF07060007,"\h(«Don»)Bon. Je vais aller me détendre dans le carré.
Vous êtes maître à bord, Vyse.\c"
MF07060008,"\h(«Don»)Alors cela veut dire que je peux continuer à
naviguer le navire encore un peu.\c"
MF07060009,"\h(«Don»)Nous allons naviguer sur cette île, n'est-ce
pas ? Alors voulez-vous prendre la barre,
Capitaine Vyse ?\c"
MF07060010,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“vous prendrez la barre.”
“Vous inspecterez un peu plus le navire.”\e"
MF07060011,"\h(«Don»)D'accord. Bonne chance, Capitaine !\c"
MF07060012,"\h(«Don»)D'accord, je m'en occupe maintenant.
Descendez discuter avec les autres membres de
l'équipage.\c"
MF08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Je…… je ne suis pas experte en navigation, et je
ne connais pas bien le monde en dehors de
Yafutoma……\e"
MF08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)…… mais je promets de faire de mon mieux pour
aider les gens.\c"
MF08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Un pays complètement recouvert de glace……
Je n'aurais jamais cru qu'il existait des
endroits pareils.\c"
MF08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Le Prince Enrique m'a parlé d'un certain
Drachma.\e"
MF08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Il en a vu de toutes les couleurs.
J'espère qu'il trouvera enfin la paix.\c"
MF08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Bien que je sache que nous n'entrerons pas dans
la ville de Valua, je suis encore nerveuse……
pour Enrique.\c"

Lune ! Félicitations !\e"
MF08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Je m'inquiète pour Fina…… Elle n'a pas l'air en
forme. Ce n'est peut-être que de la fatigue.\c"
MF08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Depuis notre retour de l'Île Dangral,
Enrique est bien silencieux…… j'espère que tout
va bien……\c"
MF08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse…… Je, je sais que je suis membre de cet
équipage et que je vous dois loyauté mais……\e"
MF08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)…… mais quelque part j'aurais préféré ne jamais
atteindre l'Île des Marins. J'ai un mauvais
pressentiment au sujet d'Enrique.\c"
MF08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Le Prince Enrique se bat seul et avec courage à
Valua…… Moi aussi, je dois me battre et faire
de mon mieux pour vous aider !\c"
MF08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Cette île qui a surgi de sous les nuages…… elle
est…… bizarre. Je perçois une grande
force sur cette île……\c"
MF08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)J'ai, j'ai cru entendre le Prince Enrique
appeler à l'aide. Je suis désolée, ce doit être
mon imagination…… Je ne me sens pas bien……\e"
MF08070014,\h(«Moegi»)Vyse…… Je sais qu'il est arrivé un malheur……\c
MF08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Continuons, Vyse !
Je ne suis peut-être pas très forte, mais je me
battrai de mon mieux pour vous aider !\c"
MF08070016,"\h(«Brabham»)Ce livre Yafutoman est incroyable ! Je n'arrive
pas à croire qu'ils soient aussi avancés !\e"
MF08070023,"\h(«Brabham»)Je serai devenu un expert en la matière à notre
retour du Pays des Glaces.\c"
MF08070017,"\h(«Brabham»)Bon, avec les techniques de moteur que les
Yafutomans m'ont apprises, nous pouvons voler
partout !\c"
MF08070018,"\h(«Brabham»)Humm…… Enrique a l'air inquiet. De mon temps, on
faisait la cour aux dames…… Elles raffolent des
marins ! Cela nous mettait du baume au coeur !
Oui mon Capitaine !\c"
MF08070019,"\h(«Brabham»)Je n'avais pas construit quelque chose d'aussi
difficile que ce moteur du Grand Océan de Nuages
depuis longtemps ! J'en ai encore mal au dos
d'avoir travaillé aussi dur !\e"
MF08070020,"\h(«Brabham»)Je n'aurais pas cru voir un moteur aussi
puissant de mon vivant…… Qui croirait que j'ai
147 ans ?\c"
MF08070021,"\h(«Brabham»)Cette île démente…… elle est sortie des
Profondeurs !\c"
MF08070022,"\h(«Brabham»)Le Delphinus fonctionne à merveille !
J'adore ce navire ! N'est-il pas beau ?!\c"
MFp0010003,"\h(«Aika»)C'est formidable, hein Vyse ? Nous pouvons enfin
traverser les récifs célestes !\c"
MFp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)Je n'arrive pas à le croire ! Je sais qu'il y a
tant à voir !\c"
MFp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)Alors, nous essayons de traverser le Récif Noir,
hein ? Je me demande comment cela se présente à
l'intérieur. Je dois avouer que j'ai un
peu peur.\c"
MFp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, tu as réussi !
Nous avons réussi à traverser le Récif Noir !\e"
MFp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)Maintenant nous pouvons voir à quoi ressemble
vraiment Yafutoma  ! J'espère qu'ils ne vont pas
essayer de nous manger avec des baguettes. Il
vaudrait mieux que Fina cache Cupil……\e"
MFp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse ! L'ennemi se prépare à nous aborder ! Nous
avons besoin de toi sur le pont, vite !\c"
MFp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)Les Tenkous, hein ?
Je suppose que même Yafutoma a un petit problème
avec les Pirates de l'Air……\c"
MFp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)Si nous continuons vers l'est et nous atteignons
l'Île Croissant, cela voudrait dire que……\e"
MFp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)……que les deux bouts du monde se rejoignent !
Mais, dans ce cas ce ne serait pas vraiment des
bouts……\c"

J'espère qu'il ne lui est rien arrivé……\c"

basse altitudes, nous pourrons aller presque
partout !\c"

Dépêchons-nous de revenir sur l'Île
Croissant !\c"

Elle devrait être sous les nuages au sud-ouest
de l'Île des Marins……\c"

terrible pour lui. Je crois qu'il faudrait le
laisser un peu seul.\e"

Profondeurs par le Vortex près de l'Île au
Temple. Allons-y, Vyse !\c"
MFp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)Cela veut dire qu'il faudra dire au revoir à
Enrique à notre retour sur l'Île des Marins…… Je
déteste les adieux……\e"

qu'il se passera ! Vyse, il faut se dépêcher de
retourner sur l'Île Dangral !\c"
MFp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Qui aurait cru qu'il existait une île aussi
grande dans l'Océan Central…… Et juste à côté de
notre Île des Pirates……\c"

Nous devrions vite rentrer sur l'Île Croissant.\e"
MFp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)Je n'aime pas l'avouer, mais…… je crois que nous
ne pouvons rien contre cette île pour le
moment.\c"

Je mentirais si je disais que je n'ai pas
peur……\e"
MFp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)Mais, cela me rassure de voir que tu es devenu
un grand capitaine, Vyse. Regarde combien de
gens sont venus se battre à tes côtés !\e"
MFp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Ils ont tous confiance en toi…… Ils te font tous
confiance…… comme moi. Nous devons absolument
gagner, n'est-ce pas ? Capitaine Vyse ?\c"

Nous devrions y aller en premier. Elle est
située à la pointe sud de Nasr.\c"

de Yafutoma devrait se trouver de l'autre
côté.\c"

Lune Bleue…… Les terres de Yafutoma ne devraient
plus être loin……\c"

sans être préparé à la bataille !\c"

Je suis une Silvite. Je suis née et j'ai grandi
dans le Grand Temple Argent……\e"

chez moi sur l'Île Croissant que nulle part
ailleurs……\c"

Retournons sur l'Île Croissant.\c"

Valua par la Bouche de Tartas……\c"

sur l'Île Dangral, nous pourrions aller chercher
mon navire dans les Profondeurs……\c"

Je suis un peu inquiète à son sujet……\c"

Pirates……\e"

Soltis !\e"

Non…… il, il ne ferait pas cela……\c"

ont péri…… Et le Delphinus n'oscille même pas
dans le vent…… Incroyable……\c"
MFa5210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)Il y a trop de rochers. Cet endroit est laid.
Peut-être que c'est la raison pour laquelle les
Valuans ont des pensées aussi cruelles.\c"

mauvaises ondes par ici.\c"
MFa5210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Il y a beaucoup d'épaves par ici. Je me demande
s'il y a aussi beaucoup de trésors……\c"

qui vivent sous les nuages et mangent les
enfants désobéissants.\e"
MFa8070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Mais en voyant comme c'est sombre ici,
je pourrais presque croire à ces histoires
d'enfants……\c"
MFa8070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Cet orage…… Je pense que vous l'avez appelé le
Récif Noir…… C'est ce qui séparait Yafutoma du

puisse survivre à un voyage dans les
Profondeurs.\e"

MFa4050000,"\h(«Domingo»)Quand je pense que même les Valuans n'ont pas vu
l'intérieur de la Bouche de Tartas……\e"
MFa4050001,"\h(«Domingo»)…… pour un peu cette muraille aurait l'air……
précieuse. Vous n'êtes pas d'accord, Vyse ?\c"
MFa4050002,"\h(«Domingo»)Regardez autour de vous, Vyse……
Personne n'a jamais mis les pieds ici……
Réfléchissez, nous sommes bel et bien dans les
Profondeurs……\e"
MFa4050003,"\h(«Domingo»)Cela met un peu de couleurs, sans ça cet endroit

tous les trésors qui sont enfouis ici-bas……\c"
MFa4050004,"\h(«Domingo»)Il y a un tas d'épaves par ici. Je me demande
combien de ces navires appartenaient à des
Pirates de l'Air……\e"

navires à la recherche de trésors, non ?\c"
MFa4060000,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Alors, voilà la Bouche de Tartas, hein ?
Hé…… Je parie que les autres scientifiques de
Valua me vénéreraient s'ils savaient que j'étais

Cristal Jaune sera incrusté dans le Giga Jaune.
Il faut être très prudents……\c"

Valua, n'est-ce pas ?\c"

anderen als Ketzer verschrien.\c"
MG01140008,"\h(«Pinta»)Um also seine These zu beweisen, machte sich
der Gelehrte auf, die Welt zu umsegeln……
aber er starb in der Dark Rift.\c"
MG01140009,"\h(«Pinta»)Ich habe gehört, dass der Nasultan jedes Jahr
ein Gefolge in die Lands of Ice sandte, damit
sie so viel Eis wie möglich zurückbrachten.\e"
MG01140010,"\h(«Pinta»)In Nasr ist Eis ein außergewöhnlicher Luxus.
Nur der Nasultan persönlich ist wohlhabend
genug, um es zu genießen…… wenn auch nur
einmal im Jahr.\c"
MG01140011,"\h(«Pinta»)Der Tempel beim Maw of Tartas ist
wahrscheinlich das größte Mysterium in
ganz Valua.\e"
MG01140012,"\h(«Pinta»)Man sagt, dass es in diesem Teil der Insel
Erdbeben gegeben hat. Wenn die Insel aber
schwebt, woher kommt dann das Beben?\c"
MG01140013,"\h(«Pinta»)Ich habe Geschichten darüber gehört, dass
Valua so eine Art Aufzug bauen soll, um tiefer
als die Great Cloud Sea zu gelangen.\e"
MG01140014,"\h(«Pinta»)Niemand weiß jedoch, wo dieser Aufzug anhält……
oder wie tief hinunter er geht.\c"
MG01140015,"\h(«Pinta»)Die Leute behaupten eine ganze Menge über die
Welt unter den Wolken. Manche sagen, es sei
das Land der Toten, andere sagen, es wäre ein
Land aus reinem Gold.\e"
MG01140016,"\h(«Pinta»)Niemand hat jedoch bisher wirklich Deep Sky
gesehen. Es ist alles ein großes Rätsel.\c"
MG01140017,"\h(«Pinta»)Die Valuaner haben demjenigen eine Belohnung
versprochen, der Enrique finden und ihn sicher
zurückbringen könnte…… Valuanische
Kopfgeldjäger suchten nach ihm.\e"
MG01140018,"\h(«Pinta»)Aber niemand hat erwartet, dass er aus eigenem
Willen zurückkehren würde. Die Kopfgeldjäger
waren gelinde gesagt verstimmt.\c"
MG01140019,"\h(«Pinta»)Also, es gibt tatsächlich hoch über dem Himmel
einen Schrein?\e"
MG01140020,"\h(«Pinta»)He…… davon wusste noch nicht einmal ich.
Den möchte ich wirklich einmal mit eigenen
Augen sehen!\c"
MG01140021,"\h(«Pinta»)Ich kann nicht fassen, dass eine Insel
tatsächlich von unterhalb der Wolken
emporgestiegen ist!\c"
MG01140022,"\h(«Pinta»)Vyse, wenn du diesen Kampf gewinnst und
gesund zurückkehrst……\e"
MG01140023,"\h(«Pinta»)……Werde ich von deinen Abenteuern berichten!
Alle werden sie von Vyse, dem Luftpiraten,
hören, mit dem es allein Daccat
höchstpersönlich aufnehmen kann!\c"
MG01140024,"\h(«Pinta»)Der Feind versucht, unser Schiff zu entern?!
O nein! Wir müssen uns zum Kampf bereitmachen!\c"
MG05100000,"\h(«Hans»)Dieses Schiff ist toll!
Allein die Kraft, die für seinen Antrieb
notwendig ist, muss astronomisch groß sein!\c"
MG05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Phänomenal…… das Äußere der Delphinus ist
so robust, dass man damit wahrscheinlich
durch Felsklippen oder sogar Gletscher
fliegen kann!\c"
MG05100002,"\h(«Hans»)Dieses Schiff…… das war doch Drachmas
Little Jack, nicht wahr?\e"
MG05100003,"\h(«Hans»)Mein Vater hat gesagt, obwohl das Schiff alt
ist, wurde es jedoch liebevoll gehegt und
geplegt. Er sagte, es sei ein sehr gutes
Schiff.\c"
MG05100004,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse, lass uns überall und alles erforschen!
Jetzt, wo wir hoch und tief
fliegen können, sollten wir davon so viel
Gebrauch machen wie möglich!\e"
MG05100005,"\h(«Hans»)Ich kann's wirklich kaum abwarten, wie sich
die frisch verbesserte Delphinus verhalten
wird!\c"
MG05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Hast du die valuanischen Pläne für den neuen
Motor verfügbar? Mann, die möchte ich mir
gern einmal ansehen!\c"
MG05100007,"\h(«Hans»)Ich kann nicht abwarten zu sehen, was sich
unter der Great Cloud Sea verbirgt! Beeilen
wir uns und testen wir die Tauchfähigkeit
der Delphinus aus!\c"
MG05100008,"\h(«Hans»)Es ist etwas entmutigend, wenn man bedenkt,
dass Enrique uns verlassen und nach Valua
zurückkehren wird, sobald wir wiederkommen……\c"
MG05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Finas Schiff kann also große Höhen erreichen?
Ich frage mich, welche Art Antrieb es hat……\c"
MG05100010,"\h(«Hans»)Wie viel Kraftaufwand es wohl gekostet hat,
Soltis aus dem Deep Sky zu heben?\c"
MG05100011,"\h(«Hans»)Von dieser Insel kam ein sehr helles Licht!
Ich frage mich, was die Lichtquelle war……\c"
MG05100012,"\h(«Hans»)Die Delphinus ist vollständig repariert!
Gehen wir, Captain Vyse!\c"
MG07060000,"\h(«Don»)Wir sollten zurück nach Crescent Isle.
Möchtest du das Steuer übernehmen?\e"
MG07060001,"\h(«Don»)Hmm…… die Lands of Ice sollten etwas weiter
südlich als der South Ocean sein. Möchtest du
jetzt das Steuer übernehmen?\e"
MG07060002,"\h(«Don»)Wir sollten doch nach Valua hinüberfahren und
erkunden, was sich darunter befindet, nicht?
Vielleicht willst du jetzt das Steuer
übernehmen……\e"
MG07060003,"\h(«Don»)Dangral Island müsste unterhalb der Wolken,
südwestlich von Sailors Island liegen.
Möchtest du jetzt das Steuer übernehmen?\e"
MG07060004,"\h(«Don»)Der Strudel, der uns in den Deep Sky bringt,
ist nahe Shrine Island, nicht wahr? Das
heißt, er sollte irgendwo im Mid Ocean
liegen.\e"
MG07060005,"\h(«Don»)Sailors Island ist in Mid Ocean, nicht wahr?
Also, Captain…… möchtest du jetzt das Steuer
übernehmen?\e"
MG07060006,"\h(«Don»)Soll das heißen, wir fliegen zu dieser Insel,
die im Mid Ocean erschienen ist? Mannomann……
Dabei habe ich ein komisches Gefühl……\e"
MG07060007,"\h(«Don»)Also gut. Ich gehe ein bisschen hinunter in
den Mannschaftssaal. Ich lasse das Schiff in
deinen Händen, Vyse.\c"
MG07060008,"\h(«Don»)He…… das wird wohl bedeuten, dass ich das
Schiff noch eine Weile weiterfliegen kann.\c"
MG07060009,"\h(«Don»)Wir fliegen in diese Insel, nicht wahr?
Möchtest du dann das Steuer übernehmen,
Captain Vyse?\c"
MG07060010,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Das Steuer übernehmen.”
“Mich noch etwas auf dem Schiff umsehen.”\e"
MG07060011,"\h(«Don»)Also dann viel Glück, Captain!\c"
MG07060012,"\h(«Don»)Ok, ich übernehme das Schiff für den Augenblick.
Geh hinunter und sprich mit dem Rest der Crew.\c"
MG08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich…… ich weiß nicht viel über Segeln……
oder was es außerhalb von Yafutoma so gibt……\e"
MG08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)……aber ich verspreche, dass ich alles tun werde,
um den anderen so gut wie möglich zu helfen.\c"
MG08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Ein Land, das total von Eis bedeckt ist……
ich hätte nie gedacht, dass es solche
Orte tatsächlich gibt.\c"
MG08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Prinz Enrique hat mir von dem Mann Drachma
erzählt.\e"
MG08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Er hat so viel durchgemacht. Ich hoffe, er
findet seinen Frieden.\c"
MG08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Obwohl ich weiß, dass wir nicht direkt in die
Stadt Valua hineingehen, bin ich nach wie
vor nervös…… wegen Enrique.\c"
MG08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse, du hast alle Moon Crystals zusammen!
Herzlichen Glückwunsch!\e"
MG08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich mache mir um Fina Sorgen…… sie sieht nicht
gut aus. Vielleicht ist sie ja nur müde.\c"
MG08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Seitdem wir von Dangral Island zurück sind,
ist Enrique so still…… ich hoffe, es geht
ihm gut……\c"
MG08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse…… ich, ich weiß, ich gehöre zu dieser
Crew und habe dir Treue geschworen, aber……\e"
MG08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)……ein Teil von mir wünscht sich, dass wir
nie Sailors Island erreichen. Ich habe das
Gefühl, dass Enrique etwas Schlimmes
zustoßen wird.\c"
MG08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Prinz Enrique kämpft tapfer ganz allein in
Valua…… ich selbst muss auch kämpfen und
alles tun, um zu helfen!\c"
MG08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Diese Insel, die aus den Wolken
emporgestiegen ist…… mit ihr…… stimmt
irgendetwas nicht. Ich spüre eine große Kraft,
die von dieser Insel ausgeht……\c"
MG08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich dachte, dass ich gerade Prinz Enrique
rufen gehört habe. Tut mir Leid, es muss
meine Einbildung gewesen sein……
Ich fühle mich furchtbar……\e"
MG08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse…… ich weiß, dass etwas Schlimmes
passiert ist……\c"
MG08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Lass uns weiterfahren, Vyse!
Ich bin vielleicht nicht sehr stark, aber ich
werde mein Bestes tun, um im Kampf zu
helfen!\c"
MG08070016,"\h(«Brabham»)Dieses yafutomanische Buch ist toll!
Unglaublich, wie fortschrittlich sie
dort sind!\e"
MG08070023,"\h(«Brabham»)Bis wir wieder von den Lands of Ice zurück
sind, bin ich Experte darin.\c"
MG08070017,"\h(«Brabham»)Jetzt, wo ich die Motorenspezifikationen von
den Yafutomanen habe, können wir fliegen, wohin
wir wollen!\c"
MG08070018,"\h(«Brabham»)Hmm…… Enrique sieht verstört aus. Zu meiner
Zeit haben wir uns die Damen geholt…… sie
sind verrückt nach Matrosen! Sie haben uns
so richtig aufgemuntert! Jawooooooohl!\c"
MG08070019,"\h(«Brabham»)Diesen Great Cloud Sea-Motor bauen war
das Schwerste, was ich seit langer Zeit gemacht
habe! Mein Rücken tut noch immer weh von all
der harten Arbeit!\e"
MG08070020,"\h(«Brabham»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich zu meinen
Lebzeiten einen solch starken Motor erleben
würde…… Wer würde schon annehmen, dass ich
147 bin.\c"
MG08070021,"\h(«Brabham»)Diese komische Insel…… sie kam aus dem
Deep Sky!\c"
MG08070022,"\h(«Brabham»)Die Delphinus läuft jetzt besser denn je!
Ich liebe dieses Schiff! Ist sie nicht
ein wahrer Schatz?\c"
MGp0010003,"\h(«Aika»)Ist doch toll, was, Vyse? Jetzt können wir
endlich durch all die Turbulenzen hindurch!\c"
MGp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)Ich kann's nicht glauben! Ich weiß, dort
draußen gibt es so viel zu sehen!\c"
MGp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)Wir wollen es also durch die Dark Rift
versuchen, ja? Ich frage mich, wie es dort
wirklich aussieht. Ich gebe es zwar nicht gern
zu, aber ich habe Angst.\c"
MGp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, du hast es geschafft!
Wir haben die Dark Rift passiert!\e"
MGp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)Jetzt können wir endlich sehen, wie Yafutoma
wirklich ist! Ich hoffe, die werden nicht
versuchen, uns mit Stäbchen zu verspeisen!
Fina sollte lieber Cupil verstecken……\e"
MGp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! Der Feind will unser Schiff entern!
Wir brauchen dich sofort an Deck!\c"
MGp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)Wie, die Tenkou?
Schätze, sogar Yafutoma hat sein eigenes
kleines Luftpiratenproblem……\c"
MGp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)Wenn wir von hier aus östlich fahren und nach
Crescent Isle kommen, kann das nur eines
bedeuten……\e"
MGp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)……dass die Enden der Welt miteinander verbunden
sind! Aber dann wären das auch nicht wirklich
die Enden der Welt……\c"
MGp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)Die ganze Insel ist zugefroren! Hihi…… da ist
schon der erste Vysezapfen! Du solltest dich
vorsehen, ich hab nämlich keinen Meißel dabei.\c"
MGp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)Captain Drachma……
Ich hoffe, es geht ihm gut……\c"
MGp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)Nun, da wir jetzt in Hoch und Tief
fliegen können, gibt es fast keine Grenzen
mehr für uns!\c"
MGp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)Wir haben alle Moon Crystals zusammen!
Beeilen wir uns und fahren wir nach
Crescent Isle zurück!\c"
MGp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)Wie? Dangral Island……
Sollte unterhalb der Wolken südwestlich
von Sailors Island liegen……\c"
MGp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)Mir tut Enrique so Leid. Er muss sich furchtbar
fühlen. Wir sollten ihn eine Weile allein
lassen.\e"
MGp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)Es sollte möglich sein, durch den Strudel nahe
Shrine Island nach Deep Sky zu gelangen.
Na los, Vyse!\c"
MGp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)Schätze, wir werden uns von Enrique
verabschieden müssen, sobald wir wieder in
Sailors Island sind…… ich hasse Abschied……\e"
MGp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)Wenn wir Galcian nicht aufhalten, wer weiß,
was dann passiert! Vyse, wir müssen schnell
nach Dangral Island!\c"
MGp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Wer hätte gedacht, dass es einmal eine so große
Insel in Mid Ocean gegeben hat…… und noch dazu
genau neben unserer Pirate Isle……\c"
MGp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse……
Wir sollten bald nach Crescent Isle
zurückkehren.\e"
MGp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)Mir gefällt es überhaupt nicht, aber…… ich
glaube nicht, dass wir im Moment etwas gegen
diese Insel ausrichten können.\c"
MGp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)Ich schätze, es ist an der Zeit, diese Sache
zu bereinigen. Es wäre aber eine Lüge zu
behaupten, ich hätte keine Angst……\e"
MGp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)Aber wenn ich mir so überlege, was du für ein
großer Kapitän geworden bis, Vyse, fühle ich
mich besser. Sieh dir nur an, wie viele Leute
aufgetaucht sind, um dir in den Kampf zu folgen!\e"
MGp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Sie alle glauben an dich…… sie alle vertrauen
dir…… genau wie ich. Wir müssen einfach
gewinnen! Stimmt's, Captain Vyse?\c"
MGp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)Die Stadt Esperanza……
Dort sollten wir zuerst vorbeischauen.
Sie liegt an der Südspitze von Nasr.\c"
MGp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)Sobald wir die Dark Rift passiert haben,
sollten wir auf der anderen Seite auf Yafutoma
stoßen.\c"
MGp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)Endlich haben wir den Himmel des Blue
Moon erreicht…… Yafutoma sollte ganz in der
Nähe sein……\c"
MGp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse! Es ist zu gefährlich, an Deck zu gehen,
ohne sich auf den Kampf vorbereitet zu haben!\c"
MGp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)Es ist so seltsam……
Ich bin Silviterin. Ich bin im Great Silver
Shrine geboren und aufgewachsen……\e"
MGp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)Aber irgendwie fühle ich mich auf Crescent
Isle wohler als anderswo……\c"
MGp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Die Lands of Ice……
Unter all dem Eis vergraben liegt der
Purple Crystal, ich hoffe, dass wir ihn
finden……\c"
MGp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse……
Lass uns nach Crescent Isle zurückkehren.\c"
MGp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass wir Valua durch
den Maw of Tartas erreichen können……\c"
MGp0020011,\h(«Fina»)Endlich haben wir den fünften Kristall!\e
MGp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)Wenn wir die Blaupausen für dieses valuanische
Schiff auf Dangral Island finden, können wir
im Deep Sky nach meinem Schiff suchen……\c"
MGp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique…… er ist in letzter Zeit so still.
Ich mache mir etwas Sorgen um ihn……\c"
MGp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Ich wurde nahe Pirate Isle von Valua
angegriffen……\e"
MGp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Mein Schiff muss irgendwo in dieser
Gegend im Deep Sky sein.\c"
MGp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique wird endlich in seine Heimat
zurückkehren können……\c"
MGp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez…… wir müssen ihn aufhalten!
Wir müssen rasch nach Dangral Island!\c"
MGp0020018,\h(«Fina»)Ramirez…… was macht er wohl auf Soltis?\e
MGp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)……!!
Nein…… er, er würde doch nicht……\c"
MGp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Warum, Vyse…… warum?\c"
MGp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, gehen wir!
Wir müssen nach Soltis!\e"
MGp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)Ich werde mit euch kämpfen!
Ramirez muss aufgehalten werden.\c"
MGa0040000,\h(«Pow»)Pau! Pau! Pau!\e
MGa1110000,\h(«Lawrence»)Möchtest du das Steuer übernehmen?\e
MGa1110001,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Das Steuer übernehmen.”
“Mich noch ein wenig auf dem Schiff umsehen.”\e"
MGa1110002,"\h(«Lawrence»)Ok, ich überlasse dir das Schiff.\c"
MGa1110003,\h(«Lawrence»)Verstehe. In Ordnung.\c
MGa1110004,"\h(«Lawrence»)Ich bin schon von allen Arten von Schiffen
verfolgt worden…… aber niemand ist mir bisher
in den Deep Sky gefolgt. He…… einmal ist immer
das erste Mal.\e"
MGa1110005,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Das Steuer übernehmen.”
“Mich noch ein wenig auf dem Schiff umsehen.”\e"
MGa1110006,"\h(«Lawrence»)Die Sicht ist zur Zeit nicht gut. Sei
vorsichtig beim Fliegen.\c"
MGa1110007,\h(«Lawrence»)Verstehe. In Ordnung.\c
MGa1140000,"\h(«Pinta»)Hier unten findet man die Überreste von so
vielen Schiffen. Es ist erschreckend, wenn
man darüber nachdenkt.\c"
MGa1140001,"\h(«Pinta»)Viele Abenteurer haben versucht, Valua zu
durchqueren, indem sie in die Spalten und
Risse im Untergrund gefahren sind.\e"
MGa1140002,"\h(«Pinta»)Aber ihre Schiffe waren nicht in der Lage,
tief genug zu fliegen, um den Eingang zu
erreichen.\c"
MGa1140003,"\h(«Pinta»)Ich schätze mich glücklich, dazu auserwählt
gewesen zu sein, den Deep Sky zu sehen……\e"
MGa1140004,"\h(«Pinta»)Ich bedaure nur, dass es sich nicht auf meinem
eigenen Schiff abgespielt hat. Tja, man kann
nicht alles haben……\c"
MGa2000000,"\h(«Marco»)Ich bekomme hier eine Gänsehaut…… Beeilen
wir uns mit dem, was wir hier zu tun haben,
damit wir schnell weg können!\c"
MGa2000001,"\h(«Marco»)Die Stadt, in der ich einmal lebte, ist genau
über uns. Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich
jemals da rauskomme……\c"
MGa2000002,"\h(«Marco»)Brabham hat mir gesagt, dass wir
die Luken geschlossen halten sollen,
solange wir hier unten sind -- damit wir
die Gespenster draußen nicht sehen……\e"
MGa2000003,\h(«Marco»)Ob es hier unten wirklich Gespenster gibt?\c
MGa5100000,"\h(«Hans»)Dieses Schiff ist wahrscheinlich das erste,
das es schaffen wird, den Maw of Tartas zu
passieren. Das ist schon an sich eine
Leistung.\c"
MGa5100001,"\h(«Hans»)Der Motor hört sich gut an. Es ist schon
erstaunlich, dass jemand tatsächlich ein so
starkes und großes Schiff gebaut hat! Ich bin
beeindruckt……\c"
MGa5100002,"\h(«Hans»)Das hier ist also die berüchtigte Dark Rift, die
so viele Menschenleben gekostet hat…… Und die
Delphinus lässt sich überhaupt nicht aus der
Bahn bringen…… Erstaunlich……\c"
MGa5210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)Hier gibt es zu viele Felsen. Dieser Ort ist
hässlich. Vielleicht hegen die Valuaner
deshalb so viele hässliche Gedanken.\c"
MGa5210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)Ich kann nicht viel ausmachen. Aber ich
spüre hier sehr viel Schlimmes.\c"
MGa5210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Hier gibt es eine Menge gesunkener Schiffe.
Ob es wohl auch einen Schatz gibt?\c"
MGa7060000,"\h(«Don»)Hier unten kann man schlecht sehen…… es ist
fast unmöglich auszumachen, wohin wir fahren.
Möchtest du das Steuer übernehmen, Captain?\e"
MGa7060001,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Das Steuer übernehmen.”
“Mich noch etwas auf dem Schiff umsehen.”\e"
MGa7060002,"\h(«Don»)In Ordnung. Sieh dich vor, dass du nicht in
etwas hineinfährst, dann ist alles ok.\c"
MGa7060003,"\h(«Don»)Na gut…… das bedeutet wohl, dass ich
hier bleiben und uns am Leben erhalten muss.
An die Arbeit, an die Arbeit……\c"
MGa7060004,"\h(«Don»)Die Sicht ist grauenhaft, ich weiß nicht,
wohin wir fahren, und ich soll dieses Ding
weiter fliegen!! Komm schon und übernimm das
Steuer, ja?\e"
MGa7060005,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Das Steuer übernehmen.”
“Mich noch etwas auf dem Schiff umsehen.”\e"
MGa7060006,"\h(«Don»)Den Monden sei Dank! Endlich kann ich mich
ausruhen! Sei aber vorsichtig; nicht dass
wir alle mit dem Leben bezahlen müssen, ok,
Captain?\c"
MGa7060007,"\h(«Don»)Was?! Oh, in Ordnung…… ich werde mich bemühen,
uns noch eine Weile am Leben zu erhalten.\c"
MGa7060008,"\h(«Don»)So sieht die Dark Rift also von innen aus……
so viele meiner Freunde haben hier den Tod
gefunden…… vielleicht solltest du das Steuer
übernehmen……\e"
MGa7060009,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Das Steuer übernehmen.”
“Mich noch etwas auf dem Schiff umsehen.”\e"
MGa7060010,"\h(«Don»)Danke, Vyse. Ich bin unten in der Kombüse.
Das ist etwas schwierig für mich……\c"
MGa7060011,"\h(«Don»)In Ordnung, Captain…… ich werde mein Bestes
tun.\c"
MGa8070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Es ist kaum zu glauben, dass wir uns jetzt
unterhalb von Prinz Enriques Heimatort
befinden.\c"
MGa8070001,"\h(«Moegi»)In Yafutoma gibt es Geschichten über Dämonen,
die unterhalb der Wolken leben und ungezogene
Kinder aufessen.\e"
MGa8070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Wenn man jedoch sieht, wie dunkel die Welt hier
unten ist, kann man diesen Kindergeschichten
fast Glauben schenken……\c"
MGa8070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Dieser Sturm…… ich glaube, du nanntest ihn die
Dark Rift…… das ist es, was Yafutoma vom Rest
der Welt abgeschnitten hat……\c"
MGa4000000,"\h(«Brabham»)Dies ist wahrscheinlich das einzige Schiff
auf der Welt, das eine Reise in den Deep Sky
überstehen kann.\e"
MGa4000001,"\h(«Brabham»)Und denk nur! Die Delphinus ist auch das erste
Schiff, das in den Maw of Tartas fährt!!\c"
MGa4000002,"\h(«Brabham»)Der Motor verhält sich gut! Wir kommen
weiterhin gut durch!\c"
MGa4000003,"\h(«Brabham»)Die Dark Rift sollte für die Delphinus kein
Problem sein. Es sollte möglich sein, einfach
hindurchzufliegen!\c"
MGa4050000,"\h(«Domingo»)Wenn ich mir vorstelle, dass die Valuaner
selbst noch nicht einmal das Innere des
Maw of Tartas gesehen haben……\e"
MGa4050001,"\h(«Domingo»)……dann erscheinen sogar die Wände hier……
wertvoll, aus irgendeinem Grund. Meinst du
nicht, Vyse?\c"
MGa4050002,"\h(«Domingo»)Schauen wir uns einmal um, Vyse……
Hier ist keiner je gewesen……
Denk mal, wir sind tatsächlich im Deep Sky……\e"
MGa4050003,"\h(«Domingo»)Das bringt etwas Farbe an diesen sonst so
traurigen Ort, nicht wahr? Denk nur an all
die versunkenen Schätze, die sich dort unten
befinden……\c"
MGa4050004,"\h(«Domingo»)Dort unten sind ziemlich viele gesunkene
Schiffe. Wie viele davon wohl Schiffe von
Luftpiraten sind?\e"
MGa4050005,"\h(«Domingo»)He…… da will man glatt abtauchen und die
Wracks nach Schätzen absuchen, meinst du
nicht?\c"
MGa4060000,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Das ist also der Maw of Tartas! He…… ich möchte
wetten, die anderen Wissenschaftler in Valua
würden mich anbeten, wenn sie wüssten, dass ich
tatsächlich hier bin……\c"
MGa4060001,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Dieser Ort ist erstaunlich…… die urwüchsige
Energie, die von ihm ausgeht, ist
einfach…… überwältigend.\c"
MGa4060002,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Ach…… dies ist also die berüchtigte Dark Rift.
So viele Menschen haben hier ihr Leben
gelassen……\c"
MGaa010000,"\h(«Aika»)Puh…… schau dir all die versunkenen Schiffe an.
Hier gibt es wahrscheinlich auch eine Menge
Gespenster…… Vyse! Hauen wir bald ab!\c"
MGaa010001,"\h(«Aika»)Wenn es uns gelingt, uns einen Weg durch diese
Felsspalten zu bahnen, sollten wir den Bereich
unterhalb des Great Seal erreichen, nicht wahr?\c"
MGaa010002,"\h(«Aika»)Wir müssen Finas Schiff finden.
Wenn etwas auf dem Echogerät erscheint, musst
du die Klaue benutzen, um es zu fassen, ok?\c"
MGaa010003,"\h(«Aika»)Puh…… Dieses Ding war ziemlich hartnäckig.
Beeilen wir uns und finden wir Finas Schiff,
damit wir zurück nach Crescent Isle können!\c"
MGaa010004,"\h(«Aika»)Hier läuft's mir kalt den Rücken runter……
Egal, wie oft wir hierher kommen. Können wir
jetzt nach Hause, Vyse?\c"
MGaa010005,"\h(«Aika»)Die Luft hier unten macht es einem auch schwer,
zu atmen…… dabei muss ich allerdings zugeben,
dass es hier unten ganz interessant ist.\c"
MGaa020000,"\h(«Fina»)Wenn wir die Dark Rift sicher hinter uns
gebracht haben, müsste Yafutoma irgendwo
auf der anderen Seite sein.\c"
MGaa020001,"\h(«Fina»)Es…… es macht mich traurig, wenn ich an all
die tapferen Matrosen denke, die ihr Leben in
diesem Strudel gelassen haben.\c"
MGaa020002,"\h(«Fina»)Der Yellow Gigas schläft irgendwo im Maw of
Tartas……\e"
MGaa020003,"\h(«Fina»)Wenn die Geschichten wahr sind, ist der Yellow
Crystal im Körper des Yellow Gigas eingelassen.
Wir müssen sehr vorsichtig sein……\c"
MGaa020004,"\h(«Fina»)Es fühlt sich etwas seltsam an, im Innern der
Insel von Valua herumzufliegen, nicht wahr?\c"
MGaa020005,"\h(«Fina»)Dieser…… Ort ist erstaunlich.
Ob wir hier wohl mein Schiff finden werden……\c"
MGaa020006,"\h(«Fina»)Dieser Ort jagt mir Angst ein, egal wie
oft wir hierher kommen……\c"
MGaa040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Würg…… Dieses Schiff schaukelt so…… so sehr……
Bitte behellige mich jetzt nicht…… ich……
mir ist ziemlich schlecht.\c"
MGaa040001,"\h(«Enrique»)Noch nicht einmal die Armada hat es durch die
Dark Rift geschafft, und hier sind wir nun……\c"
MGaa040002,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich einmal
innerhalb des Bodens von Valua fliegen
würde……\e"
MGaa040003,"\h(«Enrique»)All das hätte ich nie zu Gesicht bekommen,
wenn ich weiterhin im Palast eingeschlossen
geblieben wäre……\c"
MGaa040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Die Aussicht ist phänomenal…… ich hätte nie
gedacht, dass es unterhalb der Wolken eine
solche Welt geben könnte.\e"
MGaa040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Was bezweckt die Armada damit, wenn sie Schiffe
baut, die hier hinabtauchen können? Was hat
dieser Galcian vor?\c"
MGaa040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Bald ist der Kampf vorüber. Wir müssen Ramirez
besiegen und den Menschen dieser Welt Frieden
bringen!\c"
MGaa040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, nimm mich mit. Ich möchte mit dir nach
Soltis gehen.\e"
MGaa040008,"\h(«Wirst du Enrique mitnehmen?»)“Na klar, Enrique.”
“Tut mir Leid, aber wir brauchen dich hier.”\e"
MGaa040009,"\h(«Vyse»)Na klar, Enrique.
Es wäre uns eine Ehre, wenn du mit uns fährst.\e"
MGaa040010,"\h(«Enrique»)Danke, Vyse!
Ich werde kämpfen, so gut ich kann! Ich werde
euch nicht enttäuschen……\e"
MGaa040011,\h( )Enrique hat sich zu deiner Gruppe gesellt.\c
MGaa040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Verstehe.
Also, wenn du es dir anders überlegst, sag
mir Bescheid. Ich stehe dir augenblicklich
zur Verfügung.\c"
MGg0040000,"\h(«Pow»)Pau, pau!
Pau, pau!\c"
MGg1110000,"\h(«Lawrence»)Ihr wollt nach Crescent Isle, nicht wahr?
Das ist nördlich von Nasr.
Möchtest du das Steuer übernehmen?\e"
MGg1110001,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Das Steuer übernehmen.”
“Mich noch ein wenig umsehen.”\e"
MGg1110002,\h(«Lawrence»)Gut. Ich überlasse dir alles.\c
MGg1110003,"\h(«Lawrence»)Also gut. Ich werde das Steuer noch etwas
länger übernehmen.\c"
MGg1140000,"\h(«Pinta»)Prinz Enriques Schiff sollte das mächtigste
Schiff in der ganzen Valuan Armada sein!
Es wurde unter Verwendung der neuesten
Legierungen und Techniken hergestellt!\e"
MGg1140001,"\h(«Pinta»)Und du hast nicht nur das Schiff gestohlen,
Vyse, du hast auch gleich den Prinzen aus Valua
entführt! Du bist eine ziemliche Berühmtheit
geworden!\c"
MGg2000000,"\h(«Vyse»)Was ist das?
Ist hier etwas drin?\e"
MGg2000001,"\h(«Marco»)Gähn…
Mann, es fühlt sich gut an, endlich da
rauszukommen.\e"
MGg2000002,"\h(«Marco»)He…… lange nicht gesehen, Vyse!\e"
MGg2000003,"\h(«Vyse»)Marco!
Was machst du denn hier?!\e"
MGg2000004,"\h(«Marco»)Ich habe gehört, dass das Schiff des Prinzen
fertig ist und zur Abfahrt bereitgemacht wird.\e"
MGg2000005,"\h(«Marco»)Also habe ich mich an Bord geschlichen und
wollte damit aus Valua entkommen.\e"
MGg2000006,"\h(«Marco»)Ich habe gehört, der Prinz sei ein wirklich
netter Typ, also habe ich gedacht, er würde
mich nicht dafür umbringen, weil ich fliehen
wollte. Zumindest nicht sofort.\e"
MGg2000007,"\h(«Marco»)Aber wer hätte gedacht, dass ausgerechnet du
dieses Schiff in deine Hände bekommst! Jetzt
brauche ich dich wenigstens nicht mehr
zu suchen!\e"
MGg2000008,"\h(«Marco»)Ich werde mit dir mitfahren, ob du es willst
oder nicht. Aber, keine Sorge…… ich werde dir
nicht im Weg sein, ok?\e"
MGg2000009,"\h(«Vyse»)He…… du bist ganz schön aufdringlich, Junge.
Aber warum nicht…… du wirst mein erstes
Crewmitglied!\e"
MGg2000010,"\h( )Marco ist als “Matrose” zu deiner Mannschaft
gestoßen.\c"
MGgg050000,"\h(«Gilder»)He, Vyse.
Ich weiß nicht, woher es kommt, aber ich höre
immerzu dieses komische Geräusch dort oben……\e"
MGgg050001,"\h(«Gilder»)Ich habe mich umgeschaut, aber ich konnte nicht
herausfinden, woher es kam. Vielleicht hast du
mehr Glück. Oh, und wenn du fertig bist, muss
ich mit dir sprechen.\c"
MGgg050002,"\h(«Gilder»)Hallo, Vyse. Hast du dich auf dem Schiff
umgesehen? Ich möchte mit dir über etwas
sprechen.\e"
MGgg050003,"\h(«Was wirst du sagen?»)“Bin beschäftigt, lass uns später unterhalten?”
“Bin fertig. Worüber wolltest du reden?”\e"
MGgg050004,\h(«Vyse»)Ich habe mich noch nicht überall umgesehen……\e
MGgg050005,"\h(«Gilder»)Kein Problem. Lass dir Zeit. Aber wenn du
fertig bist, muss ich trotzdem noch mit dir
sprechen!\e"
MGgg050006,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich habe mehr oder weniger alles gesehen,
was ich wollte. Worüber wolltest du mit mir
sprechen?\e"
MGgg050007,"\h(«Gilder»)Nun, also……\e"
MGgg010000,"\h(«Aika»)Diese Crescent Isle, auf die wir Kurs nehmen,
ist doch die Insel, auf der du gestrandet
warst, nicht wahr? Ich kann's kaum erwarten,
sie zu sehen!\e"
MGgg010001,"\h(«Aika»)Ich kann es noch immer nicht fassen……
Wir bekommen unser eigenes Hauptquartier!
Genau wie auf Pirate Isle! Ist das nicht
aufregend?!\e"
MGgg010002,"\h(«Aika»)Wir sollten uns darauf konzentrieren, 100.000
Goldstücke zusammenzubekommen. Es ist
wichtiger, einen Stützpunkt aufzubauen, als
die Kristalle sofort zu bekommen!\c"
MGgg020000,"\h(«Fina»)Haha…… ich war schon immer neugierig darauf,
auf welcher Art von Insel du gestandet warst.\c"
MGgg020001,"\h(«Fina»)Wir sollten versuchen, ein bisschen Geld
zusammenzusparen, damit Brabham die nötigen
Änderungen an diesem Schiff vornehmen kann.
Das sollte nicht allzu lange dauern……\c"
MS00040000,"\h(«Pow»)¡Pow pow!
¡Pow pow!\c"
MS01110000,"\h(«Lawrence»)Tú quieres ir a la Isla de la Luna, ¿no?
Está al norte de Nasr.
¿Quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS01110001,"\h(«Lawrence»)Esperanza está al sur de Nasr.
¿Quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS01110002,"\h(«Lawrence»)Debe haber un lugar de calma dentro de la Gruta
Oscura…… por ahí podremos entrar.
¿Quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS01110003,"\h(«Lawrence»)Si seguimos en dirección noreste llegaremos a
Yafutoma…… ¿Quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS01110004,"\h(«Lawrence»)Yo me encargo a partir de ahora.
Mejor que te des prisa y vayas a cubierta.\c"
MS01110005,"\h(«Lawrence»)Quieres ir a las Tierras de Hielo, ¿no?
Creo que están al sur del Océano Sur.
¿Quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS01110006,"\h(«Lawrence»)¿Quieres ir por debajo de Valua?
Claro…… ¿Quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS01110007,"\h(«Lawrence»)¿Quieres ir a la Isla Dangral? Está bajo las
nubes, al suroeste de Isla Los Marinos, ¿no?
¿Quieres coger tú el timón?\e"
MS01110008,"\h(«Lawrence»)Debajo del mar de Grandes Nubes, junto al
remolino que se encuentra cerca de la Isla del
Templo, ¿no?
¿Quieres llevar tú el timón?\e"
MS01110009,"\h(«Lawrence»)¿A Isla Los Marinos?
¿Quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS01110010,"\h(«Lawrence»)Tenemos que ir a la isla que está en el Océano
Medio, ¿no? Entonces, ¿quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS01110011,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Coger el timón.”
“Ver un poco más del barco.”\e"
MS01110012,\h(«Lawrence»)Vale. Coge el timón.\c
MS01110013,\h(«Lawrence»)Ya veo.\c
MS01110014,"\h(«Lawrence»)Si hubiera sabido todas las cosas que tengo que
hacer, habría pedido más de 10.000 piezas de
oro.\e"
MS01110015,\h(«Lawrence»)¿Así que quieres hacerte con el timón?\e
MS01110016,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Coger el timón.”
“Ver un poco más del barco.”\e"
MS01110017,"\h(«Lawrence»)Muy bien, dejo el barco en tus manos,
Capitán Vyse.\c"
MS01110018,"\h(«Lawrence»)Pues muy bien. Seguiré dirigiendo el barco por
ahora. Tú será mejor que te des una vuelta por
el barco y hables con la tripulación.\c"
MS01140002,"\h(«Pinta»)Esperanza era una ciudad bastante próspera……
Hasta que Valua perdió su interés en ella.\e"
MS01140003,"\h(«Pinta»)Se interrumpieron las actividades comerciales
con Esperanza y ahora sólo puedes encontrar
desperdicios oxidados y marineros sin ilusión.\c"
MS01140004,"\h(«Pinta»)Cuando Esperanza estaba en su apogeo, venían
viajeros de todo el mundo que tentaban a la
suerte atravesando la Gruta Oscura.\e"
MS01140005,"\h(«Pinta»)He oído que también se daban cita ladrones y
mercaderes un poco granujas en busca de
marineros optimistas y confiados.\c"
MS01140006,"\h(«Pinta»)¡Hemos logrado atravesar la Gruta Oscura!
¡Ahora también puedo buscar objetos en esta
parte del mundo!\c"
MS01140007,"\h(«Pinta»)En Valua, existió una vez un estudioso que
afirmaba que el mundo era redondo. Pero unos le
calificaron de lunático y otros de hereje.\c"
MS01140008,"\h(«Pinta»)Así que, para demostrar la validez de su teoría,
el estudioso zarpó a navegar por todo el mundo……
pero pereció en la Gruta Oscura.\c"
MS01140009,"\h(«Pinta»)He oído que el Nasultán envía a un siervo
personal a las Tierras de Hielo una vez al año
para que recoja tanto hielo como sea posible.\e"
MS01140010,"\h(«Pinta»)El hielo es el máximo lujo en Nasr. Sólo el
Nasultán es lo suficientemente rico para poder
darse ese lujo…… y sólo una vez al año.\c"
MS01140011,"\h(«Pinta»)El templo de las Fauces de Tartas es seguramente
el lugar más misterioso de Valua.\e"
MS01140012,"\h(«Pinta»)En esa parte de la isla se producen terremotos.
Pero si la isla es flotante, ¿cómo es posible
que la tierra tiemble?\c"
MS01140013,"\h(«Pinta»)He oído que en Valua están construyendo una
especie de ascensor para llegar debajo del mar
de Grandes Nubes.\e"
MS01140014,"\h(«Pinta»)El caso es que nadie sabe dónde se para ese
ascensor…… o a cuánta profundidad llega.\c"
MS01140015,"\h(«Pinta»)La gente hace conjeturas sobre el mundo que hay
bajo las nubes. Algunos dicen que es la tierra
de los muertos, otros que es la tierra del oro.\e"
MS01140016,"\h(«Pinta»)Pero nadie ha llegado a ver el Cielo Profundo.
Es un gran misterio.\c"
MS01140017,"\h(«Pinta»)Valua prometió recompensar a quien encontrara a
Enrique y lo trajera sano y salvo. Los Cazadores
de Recompensas Valuan seguían su pista.\e"
MS01140018,"\h(«Pinta»)Nadie creyó que regresaría por su propia
voluntad. Los Cazadores de Recompensas estaban
muy decepcionados, por decirlo de forma suave.\c"
MS01140019,"\h(«Pinta»)¿Así que es cierto que hay un templo que se alza
sobre el cielo?\e"
MS01140020,"\h(«Pinta»)…… Ni siquiera yo lo sabía. ¡Me gustaría mucho
verlo con mis propios ojos alguna vez!\c"
MS01140021,"\h(«Pinta»)¡No me puedo creer que una isla surgiera de
debajo de las nubes!\c"
MS01140022,"\h(«Pinta»)Vyse, si ganas esta batalla y vuelves a casa
sano y salvo……\e"
MS01140023,"\h(«Pinta»)¡Haré correr la voz sobre tus aventuras! ¡Todos
sabrán de Vyse, el Pirata Aéreo de bravura tan
sólo comparable a la del mismísimo Daccat!\c"
MS01140024,"\h(«Pinta»)¡¿Intenta abordarnos un barco enemigo?!
¡Oh, no!
¡Tenemos que prepararnos para la batalla!\c"
MS05100000,"\h(«Hans»)¡Este navío es asombroso!
¡Tan solo la potencia que se necesita para
ponerlo en movimiento debe ser extraordinaria!\c"
MS05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Caray…… ¡el exterior del Delphinus es tan
resistente que el navío puede volar a través de
arrecifes o incluso glaciares!\c"
MS05100002,"\h(«Hans»)Ese navío…… ¿No es ese navío el Little Jack, el
barco de Drachma?\e"
MS05100003,"\h(«Hans»)Mi padre me contó que aunque el navío es viejo,
lo miman y cuidan mucho.
Dijo que es un buen navío.\c"
MS05100004,"\h(«Hans»)¡Vyse, vamos a explorarlo todo! ¡Ahora que
podemos volar a altitudes tan altas y tan bajas,
tenemos que aprovecharnos!\e"
MS05100005,"\h(«Hans»)¡De verdad que estoy impaciente por ver qué tal
funciona el motor recién mejorado del Delphinus!\c"
MS05100006,"\h(«Hans»)¿Has logrado hacerte con los planos Valuan para
el nuevo motor? ¡Caray, cómo me gustaría
echarles un vistazo!\c"
MS05100007,"\h(«Hans»)¡Estoy impaciente por ver lo que se oculta bajo
el mar de Grandes Nubes! ¡Deprisa, probemos la
capacidad de inmersión del Delphinus!\c"
MS05100008,"\h(«Hans»)Es de lo más descorazonador pensar que en cuanto
volvamos, Enrique se marchará a Valua……\c"
MS05100009,"\h(«Hans»)¿Así que el navío de Fina alcanza gran altitud?
Me pregunto qué tipo de motor llevará……\c"
MS05100010,"\h(«Hans»)Me gustaría saber cuánta potencia se necesitó
para elevar Soltis por encima del Cielo
Profundo.\c"
MS05100011,"\h(«Hans»)¡De esa isla salía un destello de luz!
Me gustaría saber de dónde procedía……\c"
MS05100012,"\h(«Hans»)¡El Delphinus está totalmente reparado!
¡Vamos, Capitán Vyse!\c"
MS07060000,"\h(«Don»)Deberíamos volver a la Isla de la Luna.
¿Quieres coger el timón?\e"
MS07060001,"\h(«Don»)Bueno…… Las Tierras de Hielo deben estar al sur
del Océano Sur. ¿Quieres llevar tú el timón
ahora?\e"
MS07060002,"\h(«Don»)Íbamos a ir a Valua e inspeccionar lo que había
debajo, ¿no? ¿Por qué no te haces cargo del
timón?\e"
MS07060003,"\h(«Don»)La Isla Dangral debe estar debajo de las nubes,
al sudoeste de Isla Los Marinos. ¿Quieres llevar
el timón?\e"
MS07060004,"\h(«Don»)El remolino que nos arrastrará al interior del
Cielo Profundo está cerca de la Isla del Templo,
¿no? Entonces debe estar en el Océano Medio.\e"
MS07060005,"\h(«Don»)Isla Los Marinos está en el Océano Medio, ¿no?
Capitán…… ¿quieres llevar tú el timón?\e"
MS07060006,"\h(«Don»)¿Quieres decir que vamos a esa isla que apareció
en el Océano Medio? Oh, Dios……
Esto no me da muy buena espina……\e"
MS07060007,"\h(«Don»)Entonces muy bien. Estaré descansando en el
comedor. Dejo el navío en tus manos, Vyse.\c"
MS07060008,"\h(«Don»)Bueno, eso significa que puedo dirigir el navío
un rato más.\c"
MS07060009,"\h(«Don»)Nos dirigimos hacia esa isla, ¿no?
¿Quieres coger el timón, Capitán Vyse?\c"
MS07060010,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Coger el timón.”
“Ver el barco un poco más.”\e"
MS07060011,"\h(«Don»)Muy bien. ¡Suerte, Capitán!\c"
MS07060012,"\h(«Don»)Yo me ocupo del navío a partir de ahora.
Baja a hablar con el resto de la tripulación.\c"
MS08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)No sé mucho de navegación, ni siquiera del mundo
que hay fuera de Yafutoma……\e"
MS08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)…… pero te prometo que voy a hacer lo que esté
en mi mano para ayudar en todo lo que pueda.\c"
MS08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Un país totalmente cubierto de hielo……
Nunca habría imaginado que existen lugares como
éste.\c"
MS08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)El Príncipe Enrique me habló de ese hombre,
Drachma.\e"
MS08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Ha pasado por tantas cosas. Espero que encuentre
lo que está buscando.\c"
MS08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Aunque sé que no vamos a entrar en la misma
ciudad de Valua, sigo estando nerviosa…… por
Enrique.\c"
MS08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)¡Vyse, has reunido todos los Cristales Lunares!
¡Enhorabuena!\e"
MS08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Estoy preocupada por Fina…… No tiene buen
aspecto. Quizá sólo esté cansada.\c"
MS08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Desde que volvimos de Isla Dangral,
Enrique ha estado muy callado……
Espero que esté bien……\c"
MS08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Vyse…… Sé que soy un miembro de la tripulación y
te debo entera lealtad, pero……\e"
MS08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)…… una parte de mí desea que nunca lleguemos a
Isla Los Marinos. Tengo la sensación de que algo
terrible le sucederá a Enrique.\c"
MS08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)El Príncipe Enrique lucha valientemente en
solitario, en Valua…… ¡Yo también lucharé por el
bien de esta misión!\c"
MS08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Esa isla que se elevó de debajo de las nubes……
hay algo raro en ella…… Tengo la sensación de
que una extraña energía emana de la isla……\c"
MS08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)Por un momento me ha parecido oír a Enrique.
Debe ser mi imaginación, perdona……
Qué sensación tan rara……\e"
MS08070014,\h(«Moegi»)Vyse…… Sé que ha pasado algo malo……\c
MS08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)¡Vamos a seguir, Vyse!
¡Aunque me fallen las fuerzas, voy a intentar
ser de ayuda en esta misión!\c"
MS08070016,"\h(«Brabham»)¡El libro Yafutoman es increíble! ¡No me puedo
creer que estén tan avanzados!\e"
MS08070023,"\h(«Brabham»)Cuando regresemos a las Tierras de Hielo ya me
habré convertido en todo un experto.\c"
MS08070017,"\h(«Brabham»)¡Con todas las especificaciones sobre motores
que he aprendido de los Yafutoman, vamos a volar
por todo el cielo!\c"
MS08070018,"\h(«Brabham»)Mmm…… Enrique parece abatido. Cuando yo era
joven, solíamos ir a ligar…… ¡A las mujeres les
encantan los marinos! ¡Con eso nos animábamos!
¡Sí, capitán!\c"
MS08070019,"\h(«Brabham»)¡Construir el Motor del Mar de Grandes Nubes es
lo más complicado que he hecho jamás!
¡Aún me duele la espalda de tanto trabajo!\e"
MS08070020,"\h(«Brabham»)En la vida hubiera pensado que llegaría a ver un
motor de semejante potencia…… Nadie diría que
tengo 147 años.\c"
MS08070021,"\h(«Brabham»)Esa isla tan extraña…… ¡salió del Cielo
Profundo!\c"
MS08070022,"\h(«Brabham»)¡El Delphinus funciona mejor que nunca!
¡Me encanta este barco! ¿No es un portento?\c"
MSp0010003,"\h(«Aika»)Es genial, ¿no crees, Vyse? ¡Por fin podemos
atravesar las grietas celestes!\c"
MSp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)¡No puedo creerlo! ¡Con la cantidad de cosas que
hay para ver allí!\c"
MSp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)¿Así que vamos a intentar atravesar la Gruta
Oscura? Me pregunto cómo será. Odio admitirlo,
pero la verdad es que tengo un poco de miedo.\c"
MSp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)¡Vyse, lo has conseguido!
¡Hemos logrado cruzar la Gruta Oscura!\e"
MSp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)¡Por fin conoceremos Yafutoma! Espero que no
quieran comernos usando unos palillos.
Fina, será mejor que escondas a Cupil……\e"
MSp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)¡Vyse! ¡El enemigo se prepara para el abordaje!
¡Te necesitamos en cubierta, deprisa!\c"
MSp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)¿Los Tenkou?
Supongo que Yafutoma tiene sus propios Piratas
Aéreos……\c"
MSp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)Si seguimos en dirección Este y llegamos a la
Isla de la Luna, eso sólo significaría una
cosa……\e"
MSp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)¡Que los límites del mundo están unidos!
Pero…… supongo que entonces no son los límites
del mundo……\c"
MSp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)¡Toda la isla está helada! Ja…… ¡Se acerca un
Vyciclón, Vyse! Mucho cuidado, que se me olvidó
traer el cincel.\c"
MSp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)Capitán Drachma…
Espero que esté bien……\c"
MSp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)¡Bueno, como podemos volar a gran altitud,
podremos ir a donde queramos!\c"
MSp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)¡Hemos reunido todos los Cristales Lunares!
¡Deprisa, tenemos que regresar a la Isla de la
Luna!\c"
MSp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)La Isla Dangral……
Debe estar bajo las nubes al sudoeste de Isla
Los Marinos……\c"
MSp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)Lo siento mucho por Enrique. Debe sentirse
fatal. Le deberíamos dejar solo un rato.\e"
MSp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)En teoría podemos bajar hasta el Cielo Profundo
por el remolino que hay junto a la Isla del
Templo. ¡Vamos, Vyse!\c"
MSp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)Cuando hayamos vuelto a Isla Los Marinos
tendremos que decir adiós a Enrique……
Odio las despedidas……\e"
MSp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)¡Si no detenemos a Galcian ahora, Dios sabe qué
va a suceder! ¡Vyse, tenemos que ir a Isla
Dangral cuanto antes!\c"
MSp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Quién hubiera dicho que antes había una isla tan
grande en el Océano Medio…… Y justo al lado de
nuestra Isla del Pirata……\c"
MSp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse……
Tenemos que darnos prisa en volver a la Isla de
la Luna.\e"
MSp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)Odio decir esto, pero…… ahora mismo no podemos
hacer nada para acabar con la isla.\c"
MSp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)Bueno, supongo que ha llegado el momento de
acabar con esto. Mentiría si dijera que no tengo
miedo……\e"
MSp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)Pero cuando veo que te has convertido en un
fantástico capitán, me siento mejor, Vyse.
¡Mira todos los que te apoyan en la batalla!\e"
MSp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Todos creen en ti…… confían en ti……
y yo también. Tenemos que ganar, ¿entendido,
Capitán Vyse?\c"
MSp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)La ciudad de Esperanza……
Primero tenemos que ir allí.
Se encuentra en el extremo sur de Nasr.\c"
MSp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)Si pasamos al otro lado de la Gruta Oscura,
encontraremos Yafutoma.\c"
MSp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)Por fin llegamos a los cielos de la Luna Azul……
Las tierras de Yafutoma deben estar cerca……\c"
MSp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)¡Vyse! ¡Salir a cubierta sin estar preparado
para la batalla es demasiado peligroso!\c"
MSp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)Es muy raro……

la Isla de la Luna que en ningún otro sitio……\c"

En algún lugar, sepultado bajo todo ese hielo,
yace el Cristal Púrpura. Espero que lo
encontremos……\c"
MSp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse……
Volvamos a la Isla de la Luna.\c"
MSp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)Nunca pensé que podríamos entrar en Valua por
las Fauces de Tartas……\c"
MSp0020011,\h(«Fina»)¡Por fin tenemos el quinto Cristal!\e
MSp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)Si conseguimos encontrar los planos de ese navío
Valuan en la Isla Dangral, podríamos ir al Cielo
Profundo y buscar mi navío……\c"
MSp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique…… Está muy callado últimamente. Me tiene
un poco preocupada……\c"
MSp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Los Valuan me atacaron junto a la Isla del
Pirata……\e"
MSp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Mi navío debe estar en algún lugar del Cielo
Profundo.\c"
MSp0020016,\h(«Fina»)Enrique por fin podrá volver a su tierra……\c
MSp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Ramírez…… ¡Tenemos que detenerle!
¡Tenemos que llegar a la Isla Dangral cuanto
antes!\c"
MSp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Ramírez…… ¡¿Me pregunto qué está haciendo en
Soltis?!\e"
MSp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)¡¡……!!
No…… él no haría……\c"
MSp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)¿Por qué, Vyse? ¿Por qué……?\c"
MSp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)¡Vamos, Vyse!
¡Tenemos que ir a Soltis!\e"
MSp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)¡Voy a luchar contigo!
Hay que detener a Ramírez.\c"
MSa0040000,\h(«Pow»)¡Pow! ¡Pow! ¡Pow!\e
MSa1110000,\h(«Lawrence»)¿Quieres coger el timón?\e
MSa1110001,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Coger el timón.”
“Ver un poco más del barco.”\e"
MSa1110002,"\h(«Lawrence»)Vale, entonces dejo el navío en tus manos.\c"
MSa1110003,\h(«Lawrence»)Entiendo. Muy bien.\c
MSa1110004,"\h(«Lawrence»)He sido perseguido por todo tipo de navíos, pero
nunca me habían seguido hasta el Cielo Profundo.
Supongo que para todo hay una primera vez.\e"
MSa1110005,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Coger el timón.”
“Ver un poco más del barco.”\e"
MSa1110006,"\h(«Lawrence»)La visibilidad es mala ahora mismo.
Ten cuidado por dónde vuelas.\c"
MSa1110007,\h(«Lawrence»)Entiendo. Muy bien.\c
MSa1140000,"\h(«Pinta»)Aquí hay restos de muchos navíos. Asusta un poco
si lo piensas.\c"
MSa1140001,"\h(«Pinta»)Muchos aventureros han intentado entrar a Valua
colándose por las grietas y fisuras que hay por
debajo.\e"
MSa1140002,"\h(«Pinta»)Pero sus navíos no podían volar a altitudes tan
bajas como para alcanzar la entrada.\c"
MSa1140003,"\h(«Pinta»)Me alegro de haber sido uno de los pocos
elegidos que han visto el Cielo Profundo……\e"
MSa1140004,"\h(«Pinta»)Lo único que siento es que no llegué a bordo de
mi propio navío. No se puede tener todo……\c"
MSa2000000,"\h(«Marco»)Este sitio me parece siniestro…… ¡Vamos a darnos
prisa y a terminar lo que hemos venido a hacer
para que podamos largarnos de aquí!\c"
MSa2000001,"\h(«Marco»)La ciudad en la que vivía antes está justo
encima. Nunca pensé que algún día saldría de
allí……\c"
MSa2000002,"\h(«Marco»)Brabham me dijo que aquí abajo debíamos tener
los postigos cerrados para no ver a los
fantasmas de fuera……\e"
MSa2000003,\h(«Marco»)Será verdad eso de que hay fantasmas afuera……\c
MSa5100000,"\h(«Hans»)Seguramente este navío ha sido el primero en
atravesar las Fauces de Tartas. Eso ya es un
gran logro.\c"
MSa5100001,"\h(«Hans»)El motor parece estar bien. ¡De verdad que es
asombroso que alguien edificara un navío de esta
potencia y envergadura! Es impresionante……\c"
MSa5100002,"\h(«Hans»)Así que ésta es la tristemente famosa Gruta
Oscura que se ha cobrado tantas vidas…… ¡Y el
Delphinus ni siquiera se mece con el viento!\c"
MSa5210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)Hay demasiadas rocas. Este sitio es horrible.
Quizá sea porque los Valuan tienen pensamientos
horribles.\c"
MSa5210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)No veo nada, pero tengo un mal presentimiento.\c"
MSa5210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Hay muchos navíos hundidos por aquí.
¿Me pregunto si también habrá tesoros……?\c"
MSa7060000,"\h(«Don»)No se ve nada aquí abajo…… Es casi imposible
saber adónde nos dirigimos.
¿Eh? ¿Querías coger el timón, Capitán?\e"
MSa7060001,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Coger el timón.”
“Ver un poco más del barco.”\e"
MSa7060002,"\h(«Don»)Está bien, pero asegúrate de que no chocamos y
no habrá ningún problema.\c"
MSa7060003,"\h(«Don»)En fin…… Supongo que eso significa que voy a
tener que quedarme aquí para que todo vaya bien.
Vuelta al trabajo……\c"
MSa7060004,"\h(«Don»)¡¡La visibilidad es espantosa, no sabemos hacia
dónde vamos y todavía me haces conducir este
cacharro!! Deberías coger el timón.\e"

“Ver un poco más del barco.”\e"
MSa7060006,"\h(«Don»)¡Gracias a las Lunas! Por fin puedo relajarme un
poco. Ten cuidado y procura que no nos maten a
todos, ¿de acuerdo?\c"
MSa7060007,"\h(«Don»)¡¿Cómo?! Ah, bueno…… Intentaré que no nos
matemos en un rato.\c"
MSa7060008,"\h(«Don»)O sea que esto es el interior de la Gruta
Oscura…… Tantos amigos encontraron aquí su
destino…… Será mejor que lleves tú el timón.\e"
MSa7060009,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Coger el timón.”

MSa7060010,"\h(«Don»)Gracias, Vyse. Estaré abajo en la cocina.
Todo esto es un poco difícil para mí……\c"
MSa7060011,"\h(«Don»)Muy bien, Capitán…… Lo haré lo mejor que
pueda.\c"
MSa8070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Cuesta creer que estamos justo debajo de la
tierra natal de Enrique.\c"
MSa8070001,"\h(«Moegi»)En Yafutoma, hay historias de demonios que viven
bajo las nubes y se comen a los niños malos.\e"
MSa8070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Pero viendo lo oscuro que está aquí abajo, casi
me creo todas esas historias de los niños……\c"
MSa8070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Esta tormenta…… Según creo la llamáis la Gruta
Oscura…… Es lo que ha mantenido a Yafutoma
aislada del resto del mundo……\c"
MSa4000000,"\h(«Brabham»)Éste debe ser el único barco del mundo que puede
sobrevivir a un viaje al Cielo Profundo.\e"
MSa4000001,"\h(«Brabham»)¡Piénsalo! ¡¡El Delphinus también ha sido el
primer navío en entrar en las Fauces de
Tartas!!\c"
MSa4000002,\h(«Brabham»)¡El motor está bien! ¡Aún nos mantenemos!\c
MSa4000003,"\h(«Brabham»)No creo que el Delphinus vaya a tener ningún
problema en la Gruta Oscura. ¡Podremos
atravesarla sin problemas!\c"
MSa4050000,"\h(«Domingo»)Cuando pienso que ni siquiera los mismísimos
Valuan han visto el interior de las Fauces de
Tartas……\e"
MSa4050001,"\h(«Domingo»)…… hace que este lugar parezca tan……
especial, no sé por qué.
¿No crees, Vyse?\c"
MSa4050002,"\h(«Domingo»)Echa un vistazo alrededor, Vyse……
Es la primera vez que alguien está aquí……
Piénsalo, estamos en el Cielo Profundo……\e"
MSa4050003,"\h(«Domingo»)De algún modo, eso hace que este sitio tan
oscuro sea algo más cálido , ¿no crees? Piensa
en todos los tesoros hundidos que debe haber……\c"
MSa4050004,"\h(«Domingo»)Aquí abajo hay muchos navíos hundidos.
Me pregunto cuántos de esos navíos serían de
Piratas Aéreos……\e"
MSa4050005,"\h(«Domingo»)Je, je…… Le dan a uno ganas de salir a buscar
tesoros entre los escombros, ¿verdad?\c"
MSa4060000,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Así que esto son las Fauces de Tartas…… Si los
demás científicos de Valua supieran dónde estoy,
se quedarían mudos de admiración……\c"
MSa4060001,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Qué lugar tan asombroso…… La energía bruta que
irradia este lugar es…… grandiosa.\c"
MSa4060002,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Así que…… ésta es la tristemente famosa Gruta
Oscura. Tantas personas han perdido la vida en
estos vientos……\c"
MSaa010000,"\h(«Aika»)Vaya…… Echa un vistazo a todos esos navíos
hundidos. Seguro que hay fantasmas errando a su
alrededor…… ¡Vyse! ¡Larguémonos de aquí!\c"
MSaa010001,"\h(«Aika»)Si pudiéramos pasar por una de estas grietas,
llegaríamos a la zona que hay bajo el Gran
Precinto, ¿no?\c"
MSaa010002,"\h(«Aika»)Tenemos que encontrar el barco de Fina.
Si algo aparece en la senda de ultrasonidos,
utiliza las tenazas para cogerlo, ¿vale?\c"
MSaa010003,"\h(«Aika»)Sin duda era algo duro. ¡Deprisa, vamos a
encontrar el navío de Fina para poder regresar a
la Isla de la Luna!\c"
MSaa010004,"\h(«Aika»)Este sitio me pone los pelos de punta…… por
muchas veces que viniera, nunca me
acostumbraría. ¿Podemos irnos a casa ya, Vyse?\c"
MSaa010005,"\h(«Aika»)Aquí, hasta el aire parece difícil de respirar……
Pero hay que reconocer que es una experiencia
interesante.\c"
MSaa020000,"\h(«Fina»)Si logramos atravesar la Gruta Oscura, Yafutoma
debe estar al otro lado.\c"
MSaa020001,"\h(«Fina»)Me entristece pensar en todos los valerosos
marinos que perdieron la vida en este
remolino.\c"
MSaa020002,"\h(«Fina»)El Gigas Amarillo duerme en algún lugar de las
Fauces de Tartas……\e"
MSaa020003,"\h(«Fina»)Si las historias no mienten, el Cristal Amarillo
está en el interior del Gigas Amarillo.
Tenemos que tener mucho cuidado……\c"
MSaa020004,"\h(«Fina»)Es una sensación muy rara volar por dentro de la
isla de Valua, ¿verdad?\c"
MSaa020005,"\h(«Fina»)Este sitio…… este sitio es asombroso.
Me pregunto si encontraremos mi nave aquí……\c"
MSaa020006,"\h(«Fina»)Por mucho que vengamos…… este sitio siempre me
dará miedo.\c"
MSaa040000,"\h(«Enrique»)El navío se tambalea…… muchísimo……
No me molestéis ahora mismo…… No…… me encuentro
muy bien.\c"
MSaa040001,"\h(«Enrique»)La Armada ni siquiera pudo atravesar la Gruta
Oscura, y mira hasta dónde hemos llegado
nosotros……\c"
MSaa040002,"\h(«Enrique»)Jamás pensé que llegaría a volar por el interior
de las tierras de Valua……\e"
MSaa040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Nunca hubiese contemplado semejantes vistas si
hubiera seguido encerrado en el palacio……\c"
MSaa040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Las vistas son increíbles…… Cómo iba a pensar
que bajo las nubes existe un mundo como éste.\e"
MSaa040005,"\h(«Enrique»)¿Cuál es el verdadero objetivo de la Armada al
construir navíos que puedan viajar hasta aquí
abajo? Qué tendrá Galcian entre manos……\c"
MSaa040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Pronto habrá terminado la batalla. ¡Tenemos que
derrotar a Ramírez y devolver la paz a las
gentes de este mundo!\c"
MSaa040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, llévame contigo. Déjame ir contigo a
Soltis.\e"
MSaa040008,"\h(«¿Vas a llevar a Enrique contigo?»)“Pues claro, Enrique.”

Príncipe y que lo estaban preparando para
zarpar.\e"

Valua en el barco.\e"
MSg2000006,"\h(«Marco»)Bueno, había oído que el Príncipe era muy majo y
pensé que no me mataría por intentar escapar.
Por lo menos no inmediatamente.\e"
MSg2000007,"\h(«Marco»)¡Pero lo que no se me habría ocurrido ni en un
millón de años es que tú te harías con este
navío! ¡Así no tendré que ir a buscarte!\e"

Pero no te preocupes…… no te molestaré, ¿de
acuerdo?\e"

no…… ¡Serás el primer miembro de mi tripulación!\e"

viene. A lo mejor a ti se te da mejor.
Y cuando termines, tengo que hablar contigo.\c"

design a flag like this.\c"

of flying freely through the skies… It's a
refreshing feeling.\c"

Heh… Maybe that kid is cut out to be an Air
Pirate after all…\c"

it's mine… I'd rather be at the helm, though. I
wouldn't feel right just sitting here.\c"

this thing. All of the gauges are brand new.

MGs034a019,"\h(«Vyse»)Eigentlich, wenn ich so drüber
nachdenke, gibt es noch ein paar Sachen,
um die ich mich erst noch kümmern möchte……\c"
MGs034a020,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Das Steuer nehmen.”
“Dich noch weiter auf dem Schiff umschauen.”\c"
MGs034a021,"\h(«Vyse»)Es ist zu gefährlich, zu manövrieren,
solange das feindliche Schiff
an unserem festgemacht ist……
Ich muss erst an Deck!\c"
MSs034a008,"\h(«Vyse»)Es el emblema de la Familia Real de Valua.
¡Creo que ha llegado el momento de cubrirlo
con la bandera de los Bandidos Azules!\c"
MSs034a009,"\h(«Vyse»)Es la bandera que yo diseñé…… Siempre
me he preguntado si alguna vez llegaría
a ser capitán de mi propio navío……\c"
MSs034a010,"\h(«Vyse»)Ésta es nuestra nueva bandera.
Deja que Aika diseñe una bandera como ésta.\c"
MSs034a011,"\h(«Vyse»)Ésta es nuestra nueva bandera.
Fina me hace pensar en volar libres por el
cielo. Es un sentimiento refrescante.\c"
MSs034a012,"\h(«Vyse»)Aquí se coló Marco en el Delphinus.
Quizás ese chico tenga madera para
ser Pirata Aéreo, después de todo……\c"
MSs034a013,"\h(«Vyse»)Ésta es la silla del Capitán. Supongo que
eso significa que es mía…… Aunque prefiero
estar en el timón. No estaría cómodo aquí.\c"
MSs034a014,"\h(«Vyse»)Sin duda no repararon en gastos.
Todos los aparatos de medida son nuevos.
Bueno, supongo que ERA para el príncipe……\c"
MSs034a015,"\h(«Gilder»)Oye, Vyse……
Antes de partir, quería hablarte de algo.\c"
MSs034a016,"\h(«Vyse»)Bueno, supongo que es hora
de que volvamos a zarpar.\c"
MSs034a017,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Tomar el timón.”
“Dar otra vuelta por el navío.”\e"
MSs034a018,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Bien!
¡Adelante, Delphinus! ¡A toda marcha!\c"
MSs034a019,"\h(«Vyse»)La verdad es que ahora que lo pienso,
había unas cuantas cosas que quería revisar……\c"
MSs034a020,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Tomar el timón.”
“Dar otra vuelta por el navío.”\e"
MSs034a021,"\h(«Vyse»)Es demasiado peligroso intentar maniobrar
cuando el navío enemigo está pegado al
nuestro. ¡Tengo que ir a cubierta!\c"
