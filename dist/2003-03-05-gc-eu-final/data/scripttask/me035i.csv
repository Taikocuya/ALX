M00040000,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow! Pow pow!\c
M01000002,"\h(«Polly»)I've been hearing that Esparanza is populated by
Ex-Valuan soldiers and sailors who lost their
ships in the Dark Rift.\e"
M01000003,\h(«Polly»)Maybe my husband is there.\c
M01000004,"\h(«Polly»)I was hoping that my husband would be in 
Esparanza, but nobody there has heard of him.\e"
M01000005,"\h(«Polly»)I really hope he wasn't killed when he tried to 
make it through the Dark Rift.\c"
M01000006,"\h(«Polly»)I can't believe that we found Robinson. 
It's a miracle that he's still alive!\e"
M01000007,\h(«Polly»)Vyse… Thank you… I'm so happy I went with you.\c
M01000008,"\h(«Polly»)So, we made it through the Dark Rift…\e"
M01000009,"\h(«Polly»)I was really hoping that my husband was still 
alive… but after seeing all those shipwrecks… 
I just don't know.\c"
M01000010,\h(«Polly»)What's going on out there?\c
M01000011,"\h(«Polly»)So, we're going back to Crescent Island? I'm 
sure my husband will feel a lot better once I 
start cooking for him again.\c"
M01000012,"\h(«Polly»)We made it through the Dark Rift, but there were
no signs of my husband. There were so many
shipwrecks in there…\c"
M01000013,"\h(«Polly»)We're going to the Land of Ice, right? I'll 
start making some really hot soup for the 
crew.\c"
M01000014,"\h(«Polly»)I have this feeling that my husband is still 
alive… somewhere… I know that he wouldn't be 
in the Land of Ice.\c"
M01000015,"\h(«Polly»)We're going into Deep Sky, right? I hope the 
ship holds up under the pressure.\c"
M01000016,"\h(«Polly»)So, we're going underneath Valua? 
I never thought I'd ever go there.\c"
M01000017,"\h(«Polly»)Fina is trying to act like nothing is bothering
her, but I can tell it's just an act. Deep down
inside, she's really upset.\e"
M01000018,"\h(«Polly»)She didn't eat much to begin with, but now she 
barely even touches her food.\c"
M01000019,"\h(«Polly»)We've been all over the world, and I still 
haven't found my husband. I can't give up hope. 
I know he's out there… somewhere.\c"
M01000020,"\h(«Polly»)Enrique is really upset. I know he used to get
airsick all the time, but even when he got sick,
he still ate more than he does now.\e"
M01000021,"\h(«Polly»)I think he was hit very hard, emotionally.\c"
M01000022,"\h(«Polly»)We've been all over the world, and I still don't
know where my husband is. I have this feeling
that he's still alive… but where?\e"
M01000023,"\h(«Polly»)I've heard that Enrique will be leaving us 
soon…\e"
M01000024,"\h(«Polly»)I'll cook all of his favorite dishes until 
then.\c"
M01000025,"\h(«Polly»)An ancient continent rose from Deep Sky… in Mid
Ocean… I saw it happen, but I still don't
believe it.\c"
M01000026,"\h(«Polly»)I'll cook anything you want, when you come back.
Good luck, Vyse!\c"
M01000027,\h(«Polly»)What? Drachma was in the Land of Ice?\e
M01000028,"\h(«Polly»)Maybe if he dedicated his life to something 
other than destroying Rhaknam, he might find 
happiness.\c"
M04090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)A familiar island will look pleasantly 
unfamiliar.\e"
M04090001,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090002,"\h(«Kalifa»)A town that is deep inside the ice… there, arch
enemies will meet, and one will die.\e"
M04090003,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090004,"\h(«Kalifa»)Rest while you can, Vyse. There is much turmoil 
ahead.\e"
M04090005,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090006,"\h(«Kalifa»)A sleeping giant in a deep cavern… 
Does not always sleep deeply.\e"
M04090007,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090008,"\h(«Kalifa»)You will be reunited with an old friend, when 
this journey comes to an end.\e"
M04090009,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090010,"\h(«Kalifa»)A powerful enemy will confront you, and your 
crew will be faced with a difficult decision.\e"
M04090011,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)In the land, without light, evil eyes await your
arrival. Be careful, Vyse.\e"
M04090013,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)At the crossroad, connecting two lands, a shadow
is cast on your path.\e"
M04090015,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)The evil… will reach down into the darkness,
and bring light. The light will bring death.
Beware, Vyse.\e"
M04090017,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090018,"\h(«Kalifa»)The land that emerged from the darkness… will 
unleash a deadly light, but silver will be its 
downfall.\e"
M04090019,\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Heed its words.\c
M04090020,"\h(«Kalifa»)Kalifa, the third daughter of the Red Moon, will
pray with all her strength for your victory.\e"
M04090021,\h(«Kalifa»)mmmmmm……\e
M04090022,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaa!\c
M05030000,"\h(«Merida»)This stage is a little bit scary, because 
it's so small. Whenever the ship rocks, 
I feel like I'm going to fall off.\c"
M05030001,"\h(«Merida»)What's the matter? Is something wrong? You won
the battle, right? Or is there something else?\c"
M05030002,"\h(«Merida»)Enrique is going back to Valua? Valua is not a
pleasant place. If I was him, I would never go
back…\c"
M05030003,"\h(«Merida»)Ever since that continent resurfaced, there's 
been something in the air… something bad… 
something really bad.\c"
M05030004,"\h(«Merida»)I felt the pain of hundreds, and heard the cries
of one.\e"
M05030005,"\h(«Merida»)I will dance for you! My dance will bring you 
luck in your fight with the evil ones.\c"
M06310003,"\h(«Osman»)Isn't Esparanza that town that's full of poor
people on the southern tip of Nasr? I think I'll
stay on the ship.\c"
M06310004,"\h(«Osman»)If this was my ship, I'd never take it into the
Dark Rift. All the damage done by those winds
could really decrease the resale value.\c"
M06310005,"\h(«Osman»)So, this is the East. Hmm… Everything looks so
exotic. You can't get anything like this in the
West.\e"
M06310006,"\h(«Osman»)So that means that if I buy anything here, 
I'll be able to sell it back home for three 
times as much gold.\c"
M06310007,"\h(«Osman»)We're being raided by pirates?! Don't let them 
take my gold!!! And stop wasting time talking 
with me, go fight them!\c"
M06310008,"\h(«Osman»)As soon as we get back to Crescent Isle, I'm
going to start my own business. I'll be rich!!!\c"
M06310009,"\h(«Osman»)In Nasr, ice is a luxury only the Nasultan can 
afford.\e"
M06310010,"\h(«Osman»)If there truly is an entire continent covered in
ice, think about how much we can make if we can
haul chunks of it to Nasr!\c"
M06310011,"\h(«Osman»)The Valuans destroyed my shop in Nasr. Just
hearing the name Valua makes me mad. Let's leave
here as soon as possible.\c"
M06310012,"\h(«Osman»)So, now we have all the Moon Crystals? 
It's time to celebrate!\e"
M06310013,"\h(«Osman»)If one of them is worth a king's ransom, imagine
how much we can get for the entire set!\c"
M06310014,"\h(«Osman»)You're going to the Valuan base? Why waste your
time there? What do they have to steal… a bunch
of iron?\c"
M06310015,"\h(«Osman»)Hmm… Prince Enrique has been moping around
lately… I wonder if he and Moegi are fighting…\e"
M06310016,"\h(«Osman»)If they break up, I'll have a chance to marry a 
wealthy prince! I can't wait!\c"
M06310017,"\h(«Osman»)If he's going back to Valua, that must mean that
they're breaking up!\e"
M06310018,"\h(«Osman»)Now's my chance to seduce him. I'll have a rich
husband in no time. How could he possibly resist
me?\c"
M06310019,"\h(«Osman»)You didn't bring me anything from the Silver
Shrine?! Hrmph… See if I give you a discount on
anything…\c"
M06310020,"\h(«Osman»)An island rose from Deep Sky! This is a sign 
that the end is coming!\e"
M06310021,\h(«Osman»)I've got to find a way to protect my gold!\c
M06310022,"\h(«Osman»)Ever since that island showed up, business 
hasn't been the same! Go destroy it at once!\e"
M06310023,"\h(«Osman»)And after you destroy it, I'll give you a big 
wet kiss to show my appreciation!\c"
M06330000,"\h(«Khazim»)Alright everyone! Make sure to eat well and get
plenty of rest! You need to save your strength
for the battle!\e"
M06330001,\h(«Khazim's Men»)Yessir!\c
M06330002,"\h(«Khazim»)The enemy is boarding us?! They're too close for
us to use our cannons! Go get 'em, Vyse!\c"
M06330003,"\h(«Khazim»)I can't believe they escaped! They went straight
up, too! We never had a clean shot at them!\e"
M06330004,"\h(«Khazim»)Next time, we'll show them! We'll blast them 
full of holes!!!\c"
M06330005,"\h(«Khazim»)An entire continent made of ice? I've never 
actually seen ice before…\e"
M06330006,"\h(«Khazim»)I've heard that the Nasultan likes to eat 
crushed ice, but it's so rare, very few people 
from Nasr have ever seen it.\c"
M06330007,"\h(«Khazim»)Get ready! We need to be in shape for our next 
battle!\e"
M06330008,\h(«Khazim's men»)Yessir! We'll get 'em!\c
M06330009,"\h(«Khazim»)You guys need to get in shape! We need to be 
ready so we can get revenge on Ramirez!\e"
M06330010,"\h(«Khazim's Men»)Yessir! We'll be ready to kick some major 
butt sir!\c"
M06340000,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)We never get a chance to rest. Khazim is always
yelling at us!\c"
M06340001,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I can't believe that the guys from that weird 
dragon ship attacked us!\c"
M06340002,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I didn't expect to find Air Pirates on this side
of the world.\c"
M06340003,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)A continent made of ice? 
I can't even imagine that.\c"
M06340004,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I can't believe that continent rose from Deep
Sky! That was the most amazing thing that I've
ever seen!\c"
M06340005,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)The cannon's are ready when you are, Captain!\c"
M06350000,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I feel strange… Not having Khazim yelling at 
me every second of the day.\c"
M06350001,\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)An ambush! Hurry to the deck!\c
M06350002,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Honestly, I didn't think there would be anything
on the other side of the Dark Rift. I was really
shocked when I saw Air Pirates!\c"
M06350003,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I have never even seen ice. The only place there
is ice in Nasr is the ice room in the
Nasultan's Palace.\c"
M06350004,\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Is Galcian down there?\c
M06350005,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)We can get back at them for what they did to us
at Nasrad! I can't wait to attack them!\c"
M08030000,"\h(«Urala»)I'm a little scared. This is the first time that
I've ever been out of Yafutoma!\e"
M08030001,"\h(«Urala»)I hope the rest of your crew likes Yafutoman 
food as much as Aika!\c"
M08030002,"\h(«Urala»)It's still hard for me to believe that there is
a continent made entirely of ice.\e"
M08030003,"\h(«Urala»)In Yafutoma… they get snow from the mountains, 
and pour flavored syrup over it. It's really 
good.\c"
M08030004,"\h(«Urala»)Umm… when I first heard about the Land of Ice,
I thought they were exaggerating. I was shocked
when I saw it!\e"
M08030005,"\h(«Urala»)With that much ice, you can make all of the
desserts that you want! And you'll never need to
drink a warm drink again!\e"
M08030006,"\h(«Urala»)Um, I might be wrong, but I think Fina is upset 
about something.\e"
M08030007,"\h(«Urala»)She normally doesn't eat that much, but now she 
eats even less. I hope she's okay.\c"
M08030008,"\h(«Urala»)Um… I made Enrique some food, but he didn't eat
it.\e"
M08030009,"\h(«Urala»)At first, I thought it was my cooking, but 
everyone else enjoyed it. I hope Enrique is 
going to be okay.\c"
M08030010,"\h(«Urala»)Um… I want to make all of Enrique's favorite 
dishes for him… before he leaves.\e"
M08030011,"\h(«Urala»)I hope he and Moegi can spend some quality time
together, before he has to go.\c"
M08030012,\h(«Urala»)Um… I'm thinking about making a sweet dessert.\e
M08030013,\h(«Urala»)I hope that will cheer Fina up a little bit…\c
M08030014,"\h(«Urala»)Um… Captain, today, I'm going to cook all of 
your favorites…\e"
M08030015,"\h(«Urala»)You'll love it. And after we win this battle, 
we can all go back to Crescent Isle and 
celebrate!\c"
M08030016,\h(«Urala»)Huh? We're going inside the continent?\e
M08030017,"\h(«Urala»)Um…
I'm a little afraid of the dark… I hope we
don't stay there for too long…\c"
M08030018,"\h(«Urala»)Um, excuse me, Vyse? I might just be 
superstitious, but that island rising up from 
Deep Sky can't be a good thing.\e"
M08030019,\h(«Urala»)I'm really scared.\c
M08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, I do not know much about sailing, 
or what is going on outside of Yafutoma…\e"
M08070001,\h(«Moegi»)But I will try my best to help all of you.\c
M08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)A continent that is covered with ice… There are
mysterious places on this side of the world.\c"
M08070003,\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique told me about Drachma…\e
M08070004,\h(«Moegi»)I hope that he will be able to find peace.\c
M08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Although we are just going through the
continent, the thought that we're going to Valua
really upsets me.\c"
M08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Congratulations! I've heard that you have all 
the Moon Crystals now.\e"
M08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)But, I'm worried about Fina because she doesn't
seem to have much energy. Is she tired or
something?\c"
M08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)I am worried about Prince Enrique… he has been
depressed ever since he came back from Dangral
Island.\c"
M08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, I apologize for the way that 
I feel, but…\e"
M08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)I was hoping that something would happen to the
ship, so we wouldn't be able to go to Sailors'
Island… and Enrique could stay.\c"
M08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique is fighting by himself in Valua.
I will do my best to help, too.\c"
M08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)The continent that emerged from Deep Sky is 
frightening… There is something evil about it.\c"
M08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)I thought that I heard Prince Enrique screaming
for help…\e"
M08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)I saw the Moon Stones fall on Valua. I hope 
Prince Enrique is okay.\c"
M08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Let's go, Captain Vyse. I'm not a sailor, but I 
will do everything I can to help you.\c"
M08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)This ship is amazing! It's like being inside a 
castle!\c"
M08150001,"\h(«Kirala»)Were there any buildings under the ice? I want 
to hear all about them when you aren't too 
busy.\c"
M08150002,"\h(«Kirala»)I heard that the buildings were hanging from the
ceiling! I really wish I could have seen it.\c"
M08150003,"\h(«Kirala»)Congratulations! I heard that you found all
the… what do you call them… Oh, the Moon
Crystals!\c"
M08150004,"\h(«Kirala»)I heard that there is a rail that goes into Deep
Sky. I wonder how the Valuans built it.\c"
M08150005,"\h(«Kirala»)If you walk by Princess Moegi's room, you can 
hear her crying.\e"
M08150006,"\h(«Kirala»)She tries to hide her feelings when she's around
us… It must be really hard for her…\c"
M08150007,"\h(«Kirala»)What, we're going into Deep Sky?! But… there's 
monsters and ghosts and all kinds of bad things 
down there!\c"
M08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)What kind of crazy island comes up from Deep Sky
after hundreds of years anyway?! I don't like 
this at all. It can't be good!\c"
M08150009,"\h(«Kirala»)We've got a battle coming up! Let me know if I 
can do anything!\c"
M08150010,"\h(«Kirala»)I can't believe your ship couldn't fly above
or below the clouds. That's got to be 
inconvenient.\c"
M14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)A frozen city, buried under ice? That sounds 
impossible!\c"
M14010001,"\h(«Izmael»)So, you're telling me that all of the buildings 
were hanging from the ceiling like icicles?!\e"
M14010002,\h(«Izmael»)I'd have to see it to believe it!\c
M14010003,"\h(«Izmael»)That Book of Ship Polarity had some amazing
stuff in it… but can you believe Brabham? He's
still got some brains in that old noggin of his!\e"
M14010004,"\h(«Izmael»)Thanks to that old fart, this ship is the only
ship outside of Yafutoma that can fly up above
the clouds!\c"
M14010005,"\h(«Izmael»)What's wrong with the prince?
Has he got a stomachache or something?\c"
M14010006,"\h(«Izmael»)When you go into Deep Sky, make sure the 
shutters are closed. If we lose pressure, we'll 
be crushed!\e"
M14010007,"\h(«Izmael»)I don't know what to expect from down there, 
so be careful!\c"
M14010008,"\h(«Izmael»)I wonder what the architecture of the Great
Silver Shrine looks like… I'd like to see it
with you guys…\e"
M14010009,"\h(«Izmael»)I bet there are all kinds of old buildings on 
Soltis! I can't wait to see how they were 
built!\e"
M14010010,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse! Hurry up and kick their butts so we 
can go check out the architecture down there!\c"
M14010011,\h(«Izmael»)This is it! Let's get 'em!\e
M14010012,"\h(«Izmael»)I can't believe I'm fighting at my age. I'm just
trying to keep up with Brabham. Oh, but don't
tell him I told you that.\c"
M14010013,"\h(«Izmael»)When I first met Enrique, all I ever saw him do
was throw up over the side of the ship. Now he's
become quite a sailor!\e"
M14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)I'm impressed that he's got the nerve to go back
to Valua!\c"
M14020000,"\h(«Belle»)I'm so sorry, Captain… I, I'm a little clumsy.
I dropped a cannonball on someone's foot
earlier, too!\e"
M14020001,"\h(«Belle»)I'll try my best, though! Just give me some 
orders and I'll try not to mess up!\c"
M14020002,"\h(«Belle»)I was so surprised to see that the Lands of Ice
were actually lands of ice! I almost fell
overboard because I was so shocked!\e"
M14020003,"\h(«Belle»)When I regained my composure, I slipped on the 
ice and fell on my butt. I think I got some 
frostbite back there.\c"
M14020004,"\h(«Belle»)Finally, we're gonna try and make our way 
underground! I am not sure how well I can do 
this, but I am going to dig as much as I can!\e"
M14020005,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha… You don't have to dig!
There are natural fissures in the ground, so we
are going to enter there.\e"
M14020006,"\h(«Belle»)Really? Heh… heh heh… Oh, umm… That's good to
know. I was wondering how we were going dig
through a continent…\c"
M14020007,"\h(«Belle»)Captain, I think there's something wrong with 
Fina. She's usually quiet, but not this quiet.\e"
M14020008,"\h(«Belle»)I hope it's not because I spilled water all over
her when I tripped over the bucket.\c"
M14020009,"\h(«Belle»)I tried doing some magic tricks to cheer Enrique
up, but…\e"
M14020010,"\h(«Belle»)… he just sat there. He looked really sad. I 
can't seem to do anything right.\c"
M14020011,"\h(«Belle»)I'm sure that Moegi has been dying inside ever
since she found out Enrique was leaving, but…\e"
M14020012,"\h(«Belle»)… I can't believe she hasn't been crying more.
She's so disciplined. I wish I could be more
like her.\c"
M14020013,"\h(«Belle»)Where'd that island come from?! How can an 
island just appear out of nowhere?!\e"
M14020014,"\h(«Belle»)It caught me by surprise and I accidentally 
knocked over a bunch of cannonballs! 
Why am I so clumsy?!\c"
M14020015,"\h(«Belle»)We are finally going to try and attack that 
island! I know I'm clumsy and I keep messing 
things up, but…\e"
M14020016,"\h(«Belle»)I've learned a lot during my time here on the 
Delphinus! I think I'll be able to do a good 
job!\c"
M14090000,"\h(«Lilly»)The Land of Ice… it sounds so romantic.
I wonder what kind of men lived there?\c"
M14090001,"\h(«Lilly»)All I ever do is polish cannonballs all day…
How am I supposed to meet guys when I'm doing
this all the time?\c"
M14090002,"\h(«Lilly»)I heard that you found all of those Moon Crystal
things. Everyone keeps talking about how
beautiful they are…\e"
M14090003,"\h(«Lilly»)That's so romantic… I want a man who is willing
to risk everything to find something as
beautiful for me…\c"
M14090004,"\h(«Lilly»)Enrique is going back home and Moegi isn't going
with him?\e"
M14090005,"\h(«Lilly»)If I was her, I would never leave the side of 
the man that I love.\c"
M14090006,"\h(«Lilly»)Where exactly is Fina's homeland? Did you meet 
her family and stuff?\e"
M14090007,"\h(«Lilly»)Hmm… I bet you were a little nervous when you 
went there, huh Vyse? I mean… you and Fina are
getting kind of close… right?\c"
M14090008,"\h(«Lilly»)That handsome admiral is staying on that 
island that came up from Deep Sky?\e"
M14090009,"\h(«Lilly»)I swear… the best looking ones are always so 
weird. Why can't I just find a normal guy?\c"
M14090010,"\h(«Lilly»)Alright, let's do this! Heh… If I become the 
female pirate who helped save the world,
the guys won't be able to resist me!\e"
M14090011,"\h(«Lilly»)I am going to give it my best!
I know we can do it, Captain Vyse!\c"
M14090012,\h(«Lilly»)We're going… where?! Do we have to?\e
M14090013,"\h(«Lilly»)I was hoping that we'd get to see some… 
nicer places on our adventure.\c"
M14090014,"\h(«Lilly»)Enrique seems so… so… brave, nowadays. I
think that makes him kinda cute.\c"
M14100000,"\h(«Nara»)Just sitting here… polishing cannonballs under 
this beautiful sky… it's so relaxing.\c"
M14100001,"\h(«Nara»)That dragon sure was impressive. Was that thing 
one of those Gigas that you guys keep talking 
about?\c"
M14100002,"\h(«Nara»)You're going to sneak into a Valuan base and 
steal something? Wow… I'd be so nervous if I 
were you…\c"
M14100003,"\h(«Nara»)Enrique hasn't been himself lately… 
Maybe I should ask him to join us out here and 
have him polish some cannonballs!\c"
M14100004,"\h(«Nara»)Even though he's in Valua, and she's here, 
they're both fighting towards the same goal!\e"
M14100005,"\h(«Nara»)That is so romantic…
Moegi, just hang in there! Enrique loves you!\c"
M14100006,"\h(«Nara»)That island gives me the creeps… coming up from
beneath the clouds like that…\e"
M14100007,"\h(«Nara»)Personally, I think we should fire a couple of 
shots at the island, just to be safe.\c"
M14100008,"\h(«Nara»)Finally, we are going to face off with Ramirez…\e"
M14100009,"\h(«Nara»)We have enough cannonballs to get us through any
fight. Make sure and use as many as you can,
Captain Vyse!\c"
Mp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Esparanza…
I can't believe we have to go to the southern 
tip of Nasr… that's awfully far.\e"
Mp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, I knew this wasn't going to be easy. 
I suppose saving the world never is.\c"
Mp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Years ago, Valua sent an entire fleet to try and
get through the Dark Rift. All of the ships were
destroyed…\c"
Mp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)It's hard to imagine that we just came out of 
the Dark Rift. These lands are beautiful!\e"
Mp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Congratulations, Vyse! You're the first captain
to ever sail his ship through the Dark Rift.\c"
Mp0040009,\h(«Enrique»)I've never seen a ship rise like that!\e
Mp0040010,\h(«Enrique»)I wonder what kind of engine it's using…\c
Mp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)According to the “Spherical World Theory,” this
world is said to be round, but no one has ever
proven it.\e"
Mp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)If we continue east and see Crescent Island, 
then we actually can prove that theory 
is correct.\c"
Mp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)The Valuan Armada has sent many research groups 
to the Land of Ice, but…\e"
Mp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)They have been unable to break through the ice, 
so they have never been able to explore what 
lies beneath it.\c"
Mp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)We've acquired the Purple Moon Crystal, and now 
we should head back to Crescent Island. 
I do feel bad for Drachma, though…\e"
Mp0040016,\h(«Enrique»)The continent of Valua is full of canyons.\e
Mp0040017,"\h(«Enrique»)I assume that there are as many cracks and 
fissures beneath Valua, as well. There must be 
a way into the Maw of Tartas.\c"
Mp0040018,"\h(«Enrique»)Finally, we have gathered all the Moon Crystals.
Let's return to Crescent Island.\c"
Mp0040019,\h(«Enrique»)I wonder what Galcian is up to…\c
Mp0040020,\h(«Enrique»)………\c
Mp0040021,"\h(«Enrique»)A design that enables ships to travel into Deep
Sky… I wonder what the Armada is up to.\c"
Mp0040022,"\h(«Enrique»)I will miss sailing with you and your crew, 
Vyse. I hate to admit it, but I'll even miss 
Aika constantly teasing me, too.\c"
Mp0040023,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, I will be back… hopefully, soon.\c"
Mp0040024,"\h(«Enrique»)We've got to stop Ramirez! Vyse, I know we can 
do it!\c"
Mp0040025,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, will you let me go with you to Soltis?\e"
Mp0040026,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Of course.”
“We've got it under control.”\e"
Mp0040027,"\h(«Vyse»)Of course, you can come with us!
Without you, we never would have gotten the 
Delphinus. Let's go!\e"
Mp0040028,"\h(«Enrique»)Thank you, Vyse!
It is an honor to accompany you!\e"
Mp0040029,\h( )Enrique has joined the party.\c
Mp0040030,"\h(«Enrique»)Well, just let me know if I can help, and I
will!\c"
Mf1000000,\h(«Polly»)I know my husband is out there… somewhere…\c
Mf1000001,"\h(«Polly»)It must have been tough, being all alone in such
a dark and scary place…\e"
Mf1000002,"\h(«Polly»)I'm so glad I came with you, Vyse! 
Thank you so much!\c"
Mf1000003,"\h(«Polly»)The thought that the entire continent of Valua
is above us doesn't exactly fill me with 
confidence.\c"
Mf1000004,"\h(«Polly»)It's so creepy down here. Our food will start 
spoiling if we stay down here much longer.\c"
Mf4090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)I cannot hear the voice of the Red Moon from 
this horrid place. I cannot give you your 
fortune until we leave here.\c"
Mf5030000,"\h(«Merida»)It's so scary down here. I hope we can leave 
here… quickly…\c"
Mf5030001,"\h(«Merida»)I hate the Valuans. I want to leave here as 
soon as we can.\c"
Mf5030002,"\h(«Merida»)This place is rather unpleasant… A lot of
different energies are converging here. The air
is heavy, in a bad way…\c"
Mf6310000,"\h(«Osman»)Get out of here quickly! What are you going to 
do if we crash into something?\c"
Mf6310001,"\h(«Osman»)Personally, I'd prefer to be in a more cheerful
place. Nobody wants to buy things when they're
scared out of their wits.\c"
Mf6310002,"\h(«Osman»)This place gives me the creeps! And how am I
supposed to make any money down here?!\c"
Mf6330000,"\h(«Khazim»)Men! We need to work hard, so we can take down 
Valua!\e"
Mf6330001,\h(«Khazim's Men»)Yessir!\c
Mf6330002,"\h(«Khazim»)So, we're flying inside Valua. I wonder if we 
can destroy the place from the inside.\c"
Mf6330003,"\h(«Khazim»)Damn, this place is creepy! Ghosts and Nasrean
peppers are the two things that I hate the most!\e"
Mf6330004,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Yessir… Khazhim, you aren't supposed to eat 
Nasrean peppers. They are used to keep the 
monsters from the desert away.\c"
Mf6340000,\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)He yells at us all day long!\c
Mf6340001,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)I never thought I'd see the inside of Valua, 
but now that I have, I wish I didn't.\c"
Mf6340002,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Isn't the underworld supposed to be full of 
ghosts?\c"
Mf6350000,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)It's weird not having Khazim yell at me every 
second. I kinda like it.\c"
Mf6350001,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Being inside of Valua isn't my idea of a 
good time.\c"
Mf6350002,"\h(«Khazim's Gunner»)Khazim has always been afraid of ghosts. I think
he heard too many stories as a little kid.\c"
Mf8030000,\h(«Urala»)Um… I miss looking at the sky…\e
Mf8030001,"\h(«Urala»)I usually love looking out the windows of the 
ship, but I don't want to see what's out there 
right now.\c"
Mf8030002,"\h(«Urala»)Um… Is it true that there are a lot of scary 
monsters here?\e"
Mf8030003,"\h(«What are you going to say?»)“Yes, it's true.”
“No, those are just stories.”\e"
Mf8030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Yes, it's true. There are all kinds of hideous 
creatures lurking just outside that window.\e"
Mf8030005,"\h(«Urala»)Uhh… um… Vyse, please don't go back to the 
bridge… don't leave me alone down here…\c"
Mf8030006,"\h(«Vyse»)No, those are just stories. Don't worry about 
it. You'll be fine.\e"
Mf8030007,"\h(«Urala»)Thanks Vyse, I feel a little bit better… Not
all better… just a little. I'll be okay.
But can we leave soon?\c"
Mf8030008,"\h(«Urala»)There's all kinds of sunken ships outside. 
Vyse, I'm really scared.\c"
Mf8150000,"\h(«Kirala»)So, Valua was built on a giant craggy rock, 
where it's always dark and stormy… 
I'm impressed.\c"
Mf8150001,"\h(«Kirala»)I used to love fooling around when I was a kid, 
and my parents always got mad at me…\e"
Mf8150002,"\h(«Kirala»)They always told me they would throw me into
Deep Sky… I never thought that I'd actually
come here.\c"
Mf8150003,"\h(«Kirala»)The winds of the Dark Rift are incredible! Now I
know why the Westerners never came to
Yafutoma!\c"
Mf4010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam Baka Bam! I never would have imagined that 
these caverns existed in Valua!\c"
Mf4010001,\h(«Izmael»)This is a scary place.\e
Mf4010002,"\h(«Izmael»)This is depressing. I'm old enough as it is… 
I don't want to see what the underworld looks 
like yet.\c"
Mf4010003,"\h(«Izmael»)People have been trying to get through the Dark 
Rift, since I was your age. Ha! That was a long 
time ago!\c"
Mf4020000,"\h(«Belle»)Oh, I can't believe it! I left all of my candy 
on the deck!\c"
Mf4020001,"\h(«Belle»)Captain, I don't think there are ghosts in 
Deep Sky.\e"
Mf4020002,"\h(«Belle»)Oh, but now that I said the word ghosts, I'm 
thinking about them again! Great, I'm scaring 
myself!\c"
Mf4020003,"\h(«Belle»)Oops, I left everyone's laundry drying on the
deck!\e"
Mf4020004,"\h(«Belle»)By now, the laundry is probably all dirty from 
the air currents… Oh, I messed up again!\c"
Mf4f90000,"\h(«Lilly»)I heard that parts of Valua are really nice, 
but even the nice parts are no fun.\c"
Mf4f90001,"\h(«Lilly»)This is such a depressing place.
I don't like places like this.\e"
Mf4f90002,"\h(«Lilly»)When we get out of here, can we go to Ixa'taka, 
so I can try the food there?\c"
Mf4f90003,"\h(«Lilly»)The Dark Rift is really scary. Look at all of 
the ships that have been destroyed here. Let's 
get out of here soon.\c"
Mf41f0000,"\h(«Nara»)I like being in the dark. I think it's 
romantic.\c"
Mf41f0001,"\h(«Nara»)I keep expecting to see ghosts. I'm really 
scared, but when I get scared, I just get 
excited.\c"
Mf41f0002,"\h(«Nara»)So many adventurers have died here in the Dark 
Rift… This place is really creepy.\c"
Mf4030000,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)I wonder how much ore is in these walls. 
Think of the weapons that I could make.\c"
Mf4030001,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Deep Sky is not a place for the living. 
We don't belong here.\c"
Mf4030002,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)If you learn how to meditate, the worst storm 
will feel like a pleasant breeze.\c"
Mf4040000,"\h(«Robinson»)I never thought that I'd see Polly again!
I'm so happy!\c"
Mf4040001,"\h(«Robinson»)This gloomy cavern is still better than the 
Dark Rift.\c"
Mf4040002,"\h(«Robinson»)I really don't like it here! This place is worse
than the Dark Rift.\e"
Mf4040003,"\h(«Robinson»)If I was marooned down here, I don't think I'd
last a day.\c"
Mf4040004,"\h(«Ilchymis»)So, this is the Maw of Tartas. If the geologists
I went to school with heard that I was here,
they'd be extremely jealous.\c"
Mf4040005,"\h(«Ilchymis»)This place is much more dangerous than all of
the scientists have theorized. There is a great
deal of energy brewing down here…\c"
Mf4040006,"\h(«Ilchymis»)There are myths that speak of a Black Moon that
used to reside in the skies amongst the others.\e"
Mf4040007,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Perhaps that Black Moon might be responsible for
the immense power and pressure down here…\c"
Mff030000,"\h(«Drachma»)I can't just sit around and let Valua destroy 
everythin'! I want to help you fight 'em! We've 
come this far, haven't we?\c"
Mff030001,"\h(«Drachma»)You are sayin' that we're goin' into that 
continent? Boy, sometimes I wonder if yer head 
is a few Moon Stones short.\e"
Mff030002,"\h(«Drachma»)But, if you insist on me goin' with you, I will.\e"
Mff030003,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Yes, it would be great if you came with us.”
“It's best if you stay here for now.”\e"
Mff030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Yes, it would be great if you came with us. 
We could use that big ol' arm of yours to crack 
some skulls.\e"
Mff030005,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumph… I guess I'll go with you, boy. I… I
never thought I'd be fightin' with you again…\c"
Mff030006,\h( )Drachma has joined your party.\c
Mff030007,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumph! That's fine with me, boy. But, let me
know if you change your mind…\c"
Mff050000,"\h(«Gilder»)So, now we're going to try and pass through the 
Dark Rift? Vyse, you really know how to party! 
There's never a dull moment on your ship.\c"
Mff050001,"\h(«Gilder»)I remember hearing about the fissures under 
Valua, but I never thought I'd see them.\c"
Mff050002,"\h(«Gilder»)The idea of exploring Deep Sky sounds more 
appealing than a tavern full of Nasr women.\c"
Mff050003,"\h(«Gilder»)Well, I guess this is it. The outcome of this
battle determines whether we're remembered as
martyrs or heroes. I'd rather be a hero.\c"
Mff050004,"\h(«Gilder»)Hey, Vyse.
You're not thinking of leaving me behind are 
you? I can't let you have all the fun!\e"
Mff050005,"\h(«What do you want do?»)“C'mon Gilder, let's go!”
“Sorry, but I need you to stay here.”\e"
Mff050006,"\h(«Vyse»)C'mon Gilder, let's go!\e"
Mff050007,"\h(«Gilder»)That's what I want to hear!
Let's go show them what we're made of!\c"
Mff050008,\h( )Gilder has joined the party.\c
Mff050009,"\h(«Gilder»)You're breakin' my heart! Alright, I'll stay. 
Let me know if you need me. Oh, and if Clara 
asks, you don't know where I am.\c"
Mii010000,"\h(«Aika»)This place is great! It's even got a kitchen! 
I think I'm gonna like it here.\c"
Mi1000000,"\h(«Polly»)Considering that it's inside of a ship, this 
kitchen is really impressive.\e"
Mi1000001,"\h(«Polly»)There's enough supplies and cookware here for me
to do my best work.\c"
Mi6310000,"\h(«Osman»)I like this ship a lot, it's strong and 
beautiful… much like myself.\c"
Mi6310001,"\h(«Osman»)If my shop hadn't been burned down, I would've
lent you 100,000 gold…\e"
Mi6310002,"\h(«Osman»)20% of 100,000 gold… Hm… That would've been
quite a profit.\c"
M14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)I didn't think I would live to see blue skies
ever again… I had almost forgotten how blue the
skies really were.\e"
M14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)I left Polly and Anne behind to chase my
dreams…\e"
M14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)To be stranded in such a horrible place… to
lose my memory… I am sure that the Moons were
punishing me for neglecting my family.\c"
M14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)I can't believe that I forgot about Polly when I
had anmnesia.\e"
M14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)But deep down inside, I felt an emptiness in my
heart. The one thing that filled it, was gone.\c"
M14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)When I was on Sailors' Island, Polly was the
only thing that kept me ashore. She was the best
thing that ever happened to me.\e"
M14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)And now that my memories have returned to me, I
will never neglect her again. I'd rather die. I
now know just how important Polly is to me…\c"
M14040007,"\h(«Robinson»)A ship capable of going into Deep Sky, huh?
It reminds me of the days when I challenged the
Dark Rift…\c"
M14040008,"\h(«Robinson»)I want the Valuan Admiral who attacked Crescent
Island to pay! Polly could have been killed in
the attack!\e"
M14040009,\h(«Robinson»)I cannot afford to lose Polly again…\c
M14040010,"\h(«Robinson»)Everything that is important to me is from 
Mid Ocean. Polly, Anne, my shop… \e"
M14040011,"\h(«Robinson»)That island appeared right in the middle of it. 
We've got to destroy it!\c"
M14040012,"\h(«Robinson»)I cannot say that I am strong enough to save the
world. I'm not pretending to be a hero either.\e"
M14040013,"\h(«Robinson»)But, I will fight to the death to protect Polly
and Anne… and to protect the world that they
live in…\c"
MF00040000,\h(«Pow»)Pow pow ! Pow pow !\c
MF01000002,"\h(«Polly»)J'ai entendu dire qu'à Esperanza, il n'y a que
des anciens soldats Valuans et des marins qui
ont perdu leurs navires dans le Récif Noir.\e"
MF01000003,\h(«Polly»)Mon mari est peut-être là-bas.\c
MF01000004,"\h(«Polly»)J'avais espoir que mon mari se trouverait à
Esperanza, mais personne n'a entendu parler de
lui là-bas.\e"
MF01000005,"\h(«Polly»)J'espère vraiment qu'il n'est pas mort en
essayant de traverser le Récif Noir.\c"
MF01000006,"\h(«Polly»)Je n'arrive pas à croire que nous ayons retrouvé
Robinson.
C'est un miracle qu'il soit toujours en vie !\e"
MF01000007,"\h(«Polly»)Vyse…… Merci…… Je suis vraiment contente d'être
venue avec vous.\c"
MF01000008,\h(«Polly»)Alors nous avons traversé le Récif Noir……\e
MF01000009,"\h(«Polly»)J'espérais vraiment que mon mari serait encore
en vie…… mais après avoir vu toutes ces épaves……
Je ne suis plus sûre de rien.\c"
MF01000010,\h(«Polly»)Que se passe-t-il là-bas ?\c
MF01000011,"\h(«Polly»)Alors, nous retournons sur l'Île Croissant ? Je
suis certaine que mon mari ira beaucoup mieux
une fois que je me remettrai à cuisiner pour
lui.\c"
MF01000012,"\h(«Polly»)Nous avons réussi à traverser le Récif Noir,
mais aucun signe de mon mari. Il y avait une
multitude d'épaves là-bas……\c"
MF01000013,"\h(«Polly»)Nous allons au Pays des Glaces, n'est-ce pas ?
Je vais faire de la soupe très chaude pour
l'équipage.\c"
MF01000014,"\h(«Polly»)J'ai le sentiment que mon mari est encore en
vie…… quelque part…… Je sais qu'il ne peut pas
être au Pays des Glaces.\c"
MF01000015,"\h(«Polly»)Nous allons dans les Profondeurs, n'est-ce pas ?
J'espère que le navire supportera la pression.\c"
MF01000016,"\h(«Polly»)Alors, nous allons sous Valua ?
Je ne pensais pas y aller un jour.\c"
MF01000017,"\h(«Polly»)Fina fait comme si de rien n'était, mais je sais
qu'elle fait semblant. Au fond d'elle, elle est
vraiment bouleversée.\e"
MF01000018,"\h(«Polly»)Déjà qu'elle ne mangeait pas grand chose,
maintenant elle touche à peine à son assiette.\c"
MF01000019,"\h(«Polly»)Nous avons voyagé dans le monde entier, et je
n'ai toujours pas trouvé mon mari. Je dois
garder espoir. Je sais qu'il est quelque part.\c"
MF01000020,"\h(«Polly»)Enrique n'est vraiment pas bien. Je sais qu'il
avait tout le temps le mal de l'air, mais même
quand il était malade, il mangeait plus que ça.\e"
MF01000021,"\h(«Polly»)Je pense que cela a été très dur pour lui d'un
point de vue émotionnel.\c"
MF01000022,"\h(«Polly»)Nous avons voyagé dans le monde entier, et je ne
sais toujours pas où se trouve mon mari. J'ai le
sentiment qu'il est toujours en vie……
mais où ?\c"
MF01000023,"\h(«Polly»)J'ai appris qu'Enrique va bientôt nous
quitter……\e"
MF01000024,"\h(«Polly»)Je lui cuisinerai tous ses plats préférés
jusqu'à son départ.\c"
MF01000025,"\h(«Polly»)Un continent ancien a surgi des Profondeurs……
dans l'Océan Central…… J'y ai assisté, mais je
n'arrive toujours pas à le croire.\c"
MF01000026,"\h(«Polly»)Je vous cuisinerai tout ce que vous voulez à
votre retour. Bonne chance, Vyse !\c"

pauvres gens à la pointe sud de Nasr ? Je crois
que je vais rester à bord.\c"

si exotique. On ne trouve pas cela à l'Ouest.\e"

MF06350002,"\h(«Canonnier de Khazim»)Franchement, je ne pensais pas trouver quelque

fait un choc de voir des Pirates de l'Air !\c"

du Pays des Glaces, je pensais qu'ils
exagéraient. J'ai eu un choc en le voyant !\e"

superstitieuse, mais ce n'est sûrement pas une

tous les Cristaux de Lune maintenant.\e"

déprimé depuis son retour de l'Île Dangral.\c"

attitude, mais……\e"
MF08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)J'espérais qu'il arriverait quelque chose au

Marins…… et Enrique pourrait rester.\c"

Moi aussi je ferai de mon mieux pour aider.\c"

effrayant…… Je sens qu'il est maléfique.\c"

secours……\e"

vous en aurez le temps.\c"

suspendus au plafond ! J'aurais aimé voir

MF08150004,"\h(«Kirala»)J'ai entendu dire qu'il existe un chemin de fer

comment les Valuans l'ont construit.\c"
MF08150005,"\h(«Kirala»)Si vous passez devant la chambre de la Princesse
Moegi, vous l'entendrez pleurer.\e"
MF08150006,"\h(«Kirala»)Elle essaie de cacher ses sentiments quand elle
est avec nous…… Ce doit être vraiment difficile

MF08150007,"\h(«Kirala»)Comment, nous allons dans les Profondeurs ?!
Mais…… il y a des monstres et des fantômes et
plein de choses horribles là-bas !\c"
MF08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)Et puis quel genre d'île surgit des Profondeurs
après des centaines d'années ?! Cela ne me plaît
pas du tout. Ce n'est pas bon signe !\c"

peux vous aider à quelque chose !\c"
MF08150010,"\h(«Kirala»)Je ne peux pas croire que votre navire ne puisse
pas voler au-dessus ni au-dessous des nuages.
Ce n'est vraiment pas pratique.\c"
MF14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Une ville gelée, ensevelie sous la glace ?
Ça a l'air impossible !\c"

glaçons ?!\e"

caboche !\e"

Est-ce qu'il a mal au ventre ?\c"

Grand Temple d'Argent…… J'aimerais aller voir
avec vous……\e"

sur Soltis. Il me tarde de voir comment ils ont
été construits !\e"

Valuans pour que l'on puisse aller voir
l'architecture !\c"

compte !\e"
MF14010012,"\h(«Izmael»)Je n'arrive pas à croire que je me bats à mon
âge. J'essaie simplement d'en faire autant que
Brabham. Oh, mais ne lui dites pas que je vous
ai dit cela.\c"

fois, il ne faisait que vomir. Maintenant il est
devenu un sacré marin !\e"

m'impressionne !\c"
MF14020000,"\h(«Belle»)Je suis vraiment désolée, Capitaine…… Je, je

Donnez-moi des ordres et j'essaierai de ne pas

Glaces était vraiment une terre de glace ! J'ai
failli passer par dessus bord tellement j'étais
choquée !\e"

glace et je suis tombée sur les fesses. Je crois

Je ne sais pas si je saurai faire du bon
travail, mais je vais creuser autant que
possible !\e"

Il y a des fissures naturelles dans le sol, nous
passerons par là.\e"

savoir. Je me demandais comment nous allions
creuser un continent……\c"
MF14020007,"\h(«Belle»)Capitaine, je crois que Fina ne va pas bien.
D'ordinaire elle parle peu, mais pas si peu.\e"
MF14020008,"\h(«Belle»)J'espère que ce n'est pas à cause de l'eau que
je lui ai renversée dessus en trébuchant sur le
seau.\c"
MF14020009,"\h(«Belle»)J'ai essayé de faire des tours de magie pour
remonter le moral d'Enrique, mais……\e"

triste. Je fais tout de travers.\c"

qu'Enrique est parti, mais……\e"

regardé partir sans pleurer. Elle est très
disciplinée. J'aimerais lui ressembler.\c"

peut-elle apparaître de nulle part ?!\e"
MF14020014,"\h(«Belle»)Cela m'a surprise et j'ai renversé par accident
un tas de boulets de canon !
Pourquoi suis-je aussi maladroite ?!\c"

du Delphinus ! Je pense que je pourrai faire du
bon travail !\c"

bizarres. Pourquoi je n'arrive pas à trouver un
homme normal ?\c"

deviens la femme pirate qui a aidé à sauver le
monde, les hommes ne pourront pas me résister !\e"

soleil…… cela me détend vraiment.\c"

Est-ce que c'était un de ces Gigas dont vous
parlez sans arrêt ?\c"

et dérober quelque chose ? Oh là là…… Je serais
vraiment nerveuse à votre place……\c"

comme cela des nuages……\e"

tirer quelques coups sur l'île, par simple
précaution.\c"

MFp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Il est difficile de croire que nous venons juste
de sortir du Récif Noir. Ce pays est
magnifique !\e"
MFp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Félicitations, Vyse ! Vous êtes le premier
capitaine à traverser le Récif Noir en navire.\c"
MFp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Je n'ai jamais vu un navire s'élever de cette
façon !\e"
MFp0040010,\h(«Enrique»)Je me demande quel moteur il a……\c
MFp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Selon la “Théorie du Monde Sphérique”, ce monde
serait rond, mais personne ne l'a encore
prouvée.\e"
MFp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Si en continuant vers l'est nous trouvons l'Île
Croissant, nous pouvons prouver que cette
théorie est correcte.\c"
MFp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)L'Armada Valuanne a envoyé des tas de chercheurs
au Pays des Glaces, mais……\e"
MFp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Ils n'ont pas réussi à percer la glace, alors
ils n'ont jamais pu explorer ce qu'il y a en-
dessous.\c"
MFp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Maintenant que nous avons trouvé le Cristal de
Lune Mauve, nous devrions retourner sur l'Île
Croissant. Mais je suis triste pour Drachma……\e"
MFp0040016,\h(«Enrique»)Le continent de Valua est truffé de canyons.\e
MFp0040017,"\h(«Enrique»)Je suppose qu'il y a aussi des tas de crevasses
et de fissures sous Valua. Il doit exister un
moyen d'entrer dans la Bouche de Tartas.\c"
MFp0040018,"\h(«Enrique»)Nous avons enfin trouvé tous les Cristaux de
Lune. Retournons sur l'Île Croissant.\c"
MFp0040019,\h(«Enrique»)Je me demande ce que Galcian mijote……\c
MFp0040020,\h(«Enrique»)………\c
MFp0040021,"\h(«Enrique»)Une technique qui permet aux navires de voyager
dans les Profondeurs…… Je me demande ce que
mijote l'Armada.\c"
MFp0040022,"\h(«Enrique»)Cela va me manquer de ne plus naviguer avec vous
et votre équipage, Vyse. Je n'aime pas
l'admettre mais même Aika, qui passe son temps à
me taquiner, va me manquer.\c"
MFp0040023,"\h(«Enrique»)Mais je reviendrai…… bientôt, j'espère.\c"
MFp0040024,"\h(«Enrique»)Il faut arrêter Ramirez ! Vyse, je sais que
c'est possible !\c"
MFp0040025,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, me permettez-vous de vous accompagner à
Soltis ?\e"
MFp0040026,"\h(«Que direz-vous ?»)“Bien sûr.”
“Nous nous en occupons.”\e"
MFp0040027,"\h(«Vyse»)Bien sûr, vous pouvez venir !
Sans vous, nous n'aurions jamais mis la main sur
le Delphinus. Allons-y !\e"
MFp0040028,"\h(«Enrique»)Merci, Vyse !
C'est un honneur de vous accompagner !\e"
MFp0040029,\h( )Enrique a rejoint l'équipage.\c
MFp0040030,"\h(«Enrique»)Bon, dites-moi si je peux vous aider et je le
ferai !\c"
MFf1000000,\h(«Polly»)Je sais que mon mari est là…… quelque part……\c
MFf1000001,"\h(«Polly»)Cela n'a pas dû être facile, être tout seul dans
un endroit sombre et effrayant……\e"
MFf1000002,"\h(«Polly»)Je suis vraiment contente d'être venue avec
vous, Vyse ! Merci beaucoup !\c"
MFf1000003,"\h(«Polly»)Cela ne m'inspire pas confiance de savoir que le
continent de Valua se trouve juste au-dessus de
nous.\c"
MFf1000004,"\h(«Polly»)Cet endroit me donne la chair de poule. Nos
provisions vont commencer à se gâter si nous
restons encore longtemps ici.\c"
MFf4090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Je ne peux pas entendre la voix de la Lune Rouge
dans cet endroit horrible. Je ne peux pas vous
lire l'avenir tant que nous restons ici.\c"
MFf5030000,"\h(«Merida»)C'est vraiment effrayant ici-bas. J'espère que
nous allons bientôt…… partir……\c"
MFf5030001,"\h(«Merida»)Je déteste les Valuans. Je veux partir d'ici le
plus vite possible.\c"
MFf5030002,"\h(«Merida»)Cet endroit est plutôt désagréable…… Toutes
sortes d'énergie convergent dans cet endroit.
L'air se raréfie……\c"
MFf6310000,"\h(«Osman»)Partez vite d'ici ! Qu'allez-vous faire si nous
nous écrasons contre quelque chose ?\c"
MFf6310001,"\h(«Osman»)Personnellement, je préférerais me trouver dans
un endroit plus gai. Personne ne veut rien
acheter quand ils sont terrifiés.\c"
MFf6310002,"\h(«Osman»)Cet endroit me donne la chair de poule !
Et comment suis-je censée gagner de l'argent
ici ?!\c"
MFf6330000,"\h(«Khazim»)Messieurs ! Il faut travailler dur, pour
arriver à faire tomber Valua !\e"
MFf6330001,\h(«Hommes de Khazim»)À vos ordres !\c
MFf6330002,"\h(«Khazim»)Alors, nous volons dans Valua. Je me demande si
nous pouvons la détruire de l'intérieur.\c"
MFf6330003,"\h(«Khazim»)Cet endroit est vraiment terrifiant !
Les fantômes et les poivrons Nasreans, c'est ce
que je déteste le plus !\e"
MFf6330004,"\h(«Canonnier de Khazim»)À vos ordres…… Khazhim, vous ne devez pas manger
de poivrons Nasreans. Ils servent à éloigner les
monstres du désert.\c"
MFf6340000,\h(«Canonnier de Khazim»)Il nous crie après à longueur de journée !\c
MFf6340001,"\h(«Canonnier de Khazim»)Je ne pensais pas voir Valua de l'intérieur un
jour, mais maintenant que je l'ai vu, j'aurais
préféré m'abstenir.\c"
MFf6340002,"\h(«Canonnier de Khazim»)Les enfers sont censés être peuplés de fantômes
non ?\c"
MFf6350000,"\h(«Canonnier de Khazim»)Cela me fait bizarre de ne pas entendre Khazim
crier à longueur de journée. Cela me plaît
bien.\c"
MFf6350001,"\h(«Canonnier de Khazim»)Je ne trouve pas ça très amusant d'être à
l'intérieur de Valua.\c"
MFf6350002,"\h(«Canonnier de Khazim»)Khazim a toujours eu peur des fantômes. Je crois
qu'il a entendu trop d'histoires quand il était
petit.\c"
MFf8030000,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… cela me manque de ne pas regarder le
ciel……\e"
MFf8030001,"\h(«Urala»)D'habitude j'adore regarder par le hublot, mais
pour l'instant je n'ai pas du tout envie de voir
ce qu'il y a dehors.\c"
MFf8030002,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… Est-ce vrai qu'il y a des tas de monstres
effrayants par ici ?\e"
MFf8030003,"\h(«Qu'allez-vous dire ?»)“Oui, c'est vrai.”
“Non, ce ne sont que des histoires.”\e"
MFf8030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui, c'est vrai. Il y a toutes sortes de
créatures hideuses devant la fenêtre.\e"
MFf8030005,"\h(«Urala»)Uhh…… um…… Vyse, ne retournez pas sur le pont……
ne me laissez pas seule ici……\c"
MFf8030006,"\h(«Vyse»)Non, ce ne sont que des histoires. Ne vous en
faites pas. Tout ira bien.\e"
MFf8030007,"\h(«Urala»)Merci Vyse, ça va un peu mieux…… Pas
complètement…… juste un petit peu. Ça va aller.
Mais pouvons-nous y aller bientôt ?\c"
MFf8030008,"\h(«Urala»)Il y a toutes sortes d'épaves là dehors.
Vyse, j'ai vraiment peur.\c"
MFf8150000,"\h(«Kirala»)Alors, Valua a été construite sur un rocher
géant escarpé, où il fait toujours sombre et
orageux…… Je suis impressionnée.\c"
MFf8150001,"\h(«Kirala»)J'adorais faire des bêtises quand j'étais
petite, et à chaque fois mes parents étaient en
colère contre moi……\e"
MFf8150002,"\h(«Kirala»)Ils me disaient toujours qu'ils me jetteraient
dans les Profondeurs…… Je ne pensais pas y aller
un jour.\c"
MFf8150003,"\h(«Kirala»)Les vents du Récif Noir sont incroyables !
Maintenant je sais pourquoi les habitants de
l'Ouest ne sont jamais venus à Yafutoma !\c"
MFf4010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam Baka Bam ! Je n'aurais jamais imaginé que
ces cavernes existaient à Valua !\c"
MFf4010001,\h(«Izmael»)C'est un endroit effrayant.\e
MFf4010002,"\h(«Izmael»)C'est déprimant. Je suis déjà assez vieux……
Je ne suis pas encore prêt à voir les enfers.\c"
MFf4010003,"\h(«Izmael»)Les gens essaient de traverser le Récif Noir
depuis le temps où j'avais votre âge. Ha ! Il y
a bien longtemps !\c"
MFf4020000,"\h(«Belle»)Oh, je n'arrive pas à le croire ! J'ai laissé
tous mes bonbons sur le pont !\c"
MFf4020001,"\h(«Belle»)Capitaine, je ne crois pas qu'il y ait des
fantômes dans les Profondeurs.\e"
MFf4020002,"\h(«Belle»)Oh, mais maintenant que j'ai prononcé le mot
fantôme, je repense à eux ! Super, je me fais
peur !\c"
MFf4020003,"\h(«Belle»)Zut, j'ai laissé le linge de tout le monde
sécher sur le pont !\e"
MFf4020004,"\h(«Belle»)Les vents ont dû salir toute la lessive……
Oh, j'ai encore tout fichu !\c"
MFf4f90000,"\h(«Lilly»)On dit que certains endroits de Valua sont très
jolis, mais même ces endroits-là ne sont pas
amusants.\c"
MFf4f90001,"\h(«Lilly»)C'est vraiment déprimant ici.
Je n'aime pas ce genre d'endroit.\e"
MFf4f90002,"\h(«Lilly»)Quand nous serons partis d'ici, pourrons-nous
aller à Ixa'taka, pour goûter leur cuisine ?\c"
MFf4f90003,"\h(«Lilly»)Le Récif Noir est vraiment effrayant. Regardez
tous les navires qui ont été détruits ici.
Partons vite d'ici.\c"
MFf41f0000,"\h(«Nara»)J'aime être dans l'obscurité.
Je trouve ça romantique.\c"
MFf41f0001,"\h(«Nara»)Je m'attends toujours à voir des monstres.
J'ai très peur, mais j'aime ça.\c"
MFf41f0002,"\h(«Nara»)Tant d'aventuriers ont péri dans le Récif Noir……
Cet endroit est vraiment horrifiant.\c"
MFf4030000,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Je me demande s'il y a beaucoup de minerai dans
ces parois. Imaginez les armes que je pourrai
fabriquer.\c"
MFf4030001,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Les Profondeurs n'est pas un endroit pour les
vivants. Nous n'avons rien à faire ici.\c"
MFf4030002,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Si vous apprenez à méditer, le pire des orages
ne sera qu'une brise agréable.\c"
MFf4040000,"\h(«Robinson»)Je ne pensais pas revoir Polly un jour !
Je suis vraiment heureux !\c"
MFf4040001,"\h(«Robinson»)Cette caverne lugubre est toujours mieux que le
Récif Noir.\c"
MFf4040002,"\h(«Robinson»)Je n'aime pas du tout cet endroit !
Cet endroit est pire que le Récif Noir.\e"
MFf4040003,"\h(«Robinson»)Si j'étais perdu ici, je pense que je ne
tiendrai pas un jour.\c"
MFf4040004,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Alors voilà la Bouche de Tartas. Si les
géologues de mon école savaient que j'étais ici,
ils seraient extrêmement jaloux.\c"
MFf4040005,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Cet endroit est bien plus dangereux que ce que
les scientifiques avaient imaginé. Il y a
beaucoup d'énergie là-dessous……\c"
MFf4040006,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Il y a des mythes au sujet d'une Lune Noire qui
existait dans les cieux parmi les autres.\e"
MFf4040007,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Peut-être que cette Lune Noire est responsable
de l'immense puissance et pression ici-bas……\c"
MFff030000,"\h(«Drachma»)Je ne peux pas rester les bras croisés et
laisser Valua tout détruire ! Je veux vous aider
à les combattre ! Nous sommes arrivés jusqu'ici
après tout ?\c"
MFff030001,"\h(«Drachma»)Vous dites que nous allons sur ce continent ?
Oh là là, je me demande s'il ne vous manque pas
quelques Pierres de Lune dans le ciboulot.\e"
MFff030002,"\h(«Drachma»)Mais, si vous insistez pour que je vous
accompagne, je viendrai.\e"

“Il vaut mieux que vous restiez ici.”\e"
MFff030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui, ce serait formidable si vous veniez avec
nous. Nous pourrions nous servir de votre bras
pour fêler quelques crânes.\e"
MFff030005,"\h(«Drachma»)Pfut…… Bon je vais venir avec vous. Je…… je ne
pensais pas que je me rebattrai un jour à vos
côtés……\c"
MFff030006,\h( )Drachma a rejoint votre équipage.\c
MFff030007,"\h(«Drachma»)Pfut ! Pas de problème. Mais, faites-moi signe
si vous changez d'avis……\c"
MFff050000,"\h(«Gilder»)Alors, maintenant nous allons essayer de
traverser le Récif Noir ? Vyse, vous savez
vraiment faire la fête !
On ne s'ennuie jamais sur votre navire.\c"
MFff050001,"\h(«Gilder»)Je me souviens avoir entendu parler des fissures
sous Valua, mais je ne pensais pas les voir un
jour.\c"
MFff050002,"\h(«Gilder»)Je préfère encore l'idée d'explorer les
Profondeurs qu'une taverne pleine de femmes
Nasreanes.\c"
MFff050003,"\h(«Gilder»)Bon, voilà. À la fin de cette bataille, les gens
se souviendront de nous comme martyres ou comme
héros. Je préfèrerais être un héros.\c"
MFff050004,"\h(«Gilder»)Hé, Vyse.
Vous ne pensiez pas partir sans moi ? Je ne
permets pas que vous vous amusiez sans moi !\e"

“Désolé, mais ils ont besoin de vous ici.”\e"
MFff050006,"\h(«Vyse»)Allez Gilder, allons-y !\e"
MFff050007,"\h(«Gilder»)Voilà ce que j'aime entendre ! Allons leur
montrer de quoi nous sommes capables !\c"

MFff050009,"\h(«Gilder»)Vous allez me faire pleurer ! D'accord, je
reste. Faites-moi signe si vous avez besoin de
moi. Oh, et si Clara vous demande où je suis,
vous n'en savez rien.\c"
MFii010000,"\h(«Aika»)Cet endroit est formidable ! Il y a même une
cuisine ! Je pense que je vais me plaire ici.\c"
MFi1000000,"\h(«Polly»)C'est vraiment impressionnant pour une cuisine à
l'intérieur d'un navire.\e"

travailler au mieux.\c"
MFi6310000,"\h(«Osman»)J'aime beaucoup ce navire, il est puissant et
magnifique…… il me ressemble beaucoup.\c"

un sacré profit.\c"
MF14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)Je ne pensais pas revoir les Cieux Bleus un
jour…… J' en avais presque oublié l'intensité du
bleu.\e"

rêves……\e"

mémoire…… Je suis sûr que les Lunes me
punissaient pour avoir négligé ma famille.\c"

Polly quand j'étais amnésique.\e"

froid. Ce qui me réchauffait le coeur a
disparu.\c"

me donnait une raison de ne pas partir en mer.
Ma rencontre avec Polly, c'est la meilleure
chose qui me soit jamais arrivée.\e"

ne la négligerai plus jamais. Je préfèrerais
mourir. J'ai compris à quel point Polly compte
pour moi……\c"

hein ? Cela me rappelle l'époque où j'ai défié
le Récif Noir……\c"

attaqué l'Île Croissant ! Polly aurait pu être
tuée pendant l'attaque !\e"

aber es gab kein Zeichen von meinem Mann.

für die Mannschaft eine richtig schöne heiße
Suppe zubereiten.\c"

dorthin käme.\c"

MG05030004,"\h(«Merida»)Ich fühlte den Schmerz von Hunderten und hörte
die Schreie von einem.\e"
MG05030005,"\h(«Merida»)Ich werde für euch tanzen! Mein Tanz wird
euch im Kampf gegen die Bösen Glück bringen.\c"
MG06310003,"\h(«Osman»)Ist Esperanza nicht diese Stadt an der
Südspitze von Nasr, die voller
armer Leute ist? Ich glaube, ich bleibe
auf dem Schiff.\c"
MG06310004,"\h(«Osman»)Wenn das mein Schiff wäre, würde ich es niemals
mit durch die Dark Rift nehmen. Der Schaden, den
dieser Wind anrichtet, könnte seinen
Wiederverkaufswert herabsetzen.\c"
MG06310005,"\h(«Osman»)Das ist also der Osten. Hmm…… Alles sieht sehr
exotisch aus. So was bekommt man im Westen
nicht.\e"
MG06310006,"\h(«Osman»)Das würde also bedeuten, wenn ich hier etwas
kaufe, kann ich es zu Hause für dreimal so viel
Gold verkaufen.\c"
MG06310007,"\h(«Osman»)Wir werden von Piraten überfallen?! Lasst sie
nicht mein Gold nehmen!!! Und hört auf, mit
mir zu quatschen, geht sie lieber bekämpfen!\c"
MG06310008,"\h(«Osman»)Sobald wir wieder auf Crescent Isle sind,
werde ich mein eigenes Geschäft eröffnen.
Ich werde reich!!!\c"
MG06310009,"\h(«Osman»)In Nasr ist Eis ein Luxusgut, das sich allein
der Nasultan leisten kann.\e"
MG06310010,"\h(«Osman»)Wenn es tatsächlich einen ganzen Kontinent gibt,
der mit Eis überzogen ist, denkt nur, wie
viel wir verdienen könnten, wenn wir davon
ganze Blöcke nach Nasr schaffen!\c"
MG06310011,"\h(«Osman»)Die Valuaner haben mein Geschäft in Nasr
zerstört. Allein den Namen Valua zu hören,
macht mich verrückt. Lasst uns so bald wie
möglich von hier weggehen.\c"
MG06310012,"\h(«Osman»)Wir haben alle Moon Crystals?
Dann lasst uns feiern!\e"
MG06310013,"\h(«Osman»)Wenn einer davon schon eine Menge Geld wert
ist, stellt euch vor, wie viel wir für den
ganzen Satz bekommen können!\c"
MG06310014,"\h(«Osman»)Ihr fahrt zum valuanischen Stützpunkt? Warum
dort eure Zeit verschwenden? Was gibt es da
zu stehlen…… einen Haufen Eisen?\c"
MG06310015,"\h(«Osman»)Hmm…… Prinz Enrique schleicht in letzter Zeit
nur noch herum…… ob er und Moegi
wohl einen Streit haben?\e"
MG06310016,"\h(«Osman»)Wenn sie sich trennen, dann habe ich die
Chance, einen wohlhabenden Prinzen zu
heiraten! Ich kann's kaum erwarten!\c"
MG06310017,"\h(«Osman»)Wenn er nach Valua zurückgeht, muss das
bedeuten, dass sie sich trennen!\e"
MG06310018,"\h(«Osman»)Das ist jetzt meine Chance, ihn zu verführen.
Im Nu werde ich einen reichen Mann haben.
Wie könnte er mir widerstehen?\c"
MG06310019,"\h(«Osman»)Ihr habt mir nichts vom Silver Shrine
mitgebracht?! Hrmf…… und ihr erwartet etwa
noch einen Rabatt?\c"
MG06310020,"\h(«Osman»)Eine Insel hat sich aus dem Deep Sky erhoben!
Das ist ein Zeichen, dass das Ende nah ist!\e"
MG06310021,"\h(«Osman»)Ich muss eine Möglichkeit finden, mein Gold
zu schützen!\c"
MG06310022,"\h(«Osman»)Seitdem diese Insel erschienen ist, ist das
Geschäft nicht mehr dasselbe! Ihr solltet sie
sofort zerstören gehen!\e"
MG06310023,"\h(«Osman»)Und nachdem er sie zerstört habt, bekommt
ihr einen dicken Kuss zum Zeichen meines
Dankes!\c"
MG06330000,"\h(«Khazim»)Alle mal herhören! Esst gut und ruht euch
richtig aus! Ihr müsst eure Kräfte für den
Kampf schonen!\e"
MG06330001,"\h(«Khazims Männer»)Zu Befehl, Sir!\c"
MG06330002,"\h(«Khazim»)Der Feind entert unser Schiff?! Sie sind zu
nahe dran, um unsere Kanonen einzusetzen!
Hol' sie dir, Vyse!\c"
MG06330003,"\h(«Khazim»)Ich kann's nicht glauben, dass sie entkommen
sind! Sie sind einfach aufgestiegen! Wir
hatten nie richtig Gelegenheit, sie zu
treffen!\e"
MG06330004,"\h(«Khazim»)Das nächste Mal zeigen wir es ihnen!
Wir werden sie durchlöchern!!!\c"
MG06330005,"\h(«Khazim»)Ein ganzer Kontinent aus Eis? Ich habe noch
nie zuvor Eis gesehen……\e"
MG06330006,"\h(«Khazim»)Ich habe gehört, dass der Nasultan gerne
zerstoßenes Eis isst, aber es ist so schwer
erhältlich, dass nur sehr wenige Leute aus
Nasr es je gesehen haben.\c"
MG06330007,"\h(«Khazim»)Macht euch bereit! Wir müssen für den nächsten
Kampf in Form sein!\e"
MG06330008,\h(«Khazims Männer»)Zu Befehl! Wir holen sie uns!\c
MG06330009,"\h(«Khazim»)Ihr müsst in Form sein! Wir müssen bereit sein,
damit wir uns an Ramirez rächen können!\e"
MG06330010,"\h(«Khazims Männer»)Zu Befehl! Wir sind bereit für ein
großes Gefecht!\c"
MG06340000,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Wir haben nie Gelegenheit, uns auszuruhen.
Khazim brüllt uns ständig an!\c"
MG06340001,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ich kann's nicht fassen, dass sie uns mit
diesem komischen Drachenschiff angegriffen
haben!\c"
MG06340002,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ich habe nicht erwartet, auf dieser Seite der
Welt Luftpiraten zu finden.\c"
MG06340003,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ein Kontinent aus Eis?
Das kann ich mir noch nicht einmal vorstellen.\c"
MG06340004,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ich kann's nicht glauben, dass dieser
Kontinent sich aus dem Deep Sky erhoben hat!
Das war das Erstaunlichste, was ich je gesehen
habe!\c"
MG06340005,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Die Kanonen sind jederzeit bereit, Captain!\c"
MG06350000,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Fühlt sich komisch an…… dass Khazim uns nicht
jede Sekunde anbrüllt.\c"
MG06350001,\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ein Hinterhalt! Alle Mann an Deck!\c
MG06350002,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ich hätte wirklich nicht gedacht, dass es auf
der anderen Seite der Dark Rift noch etwas
gibt. Ich war schockiert, als ich dort
Luftpiraten sah!\c"
MG06350003,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ich habe noch nie Eis gesehen. Der einzige
Ort in Nasr, wo es Eis gibt, ist der
Eisspeicher im Palast des Nasultans.\c"
MG06350004,\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ist Galcian dort unten?\c
MG06350005,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Wir können ihnen das heimzahlen, was sie uns
in Nasrad angetan haben! Ich kann's nicht
erwarten, sie anzugreifen!\c"
MG08030000,"\h(«Urala»)Ich habe etwas Angst. Es ist das erste Mal,
dass ich Yafutoma verlasse!\e"
MG08030001,"\h(«Urala»)Ich hoffe, der Rest der Mannschaft mag
yafutomanisches Essen so sehr wie Aika!\c"
MG08030002,"\h(«Urala»)Mir fällt es noch immer schwer zu glauben,
dass es einen Kontinent gibt, der vollständig
aus Eis besteht.\e"
MG08030003,"\h(«Urala»)In Yafutoma…… bekommt man Schnee von den
Bergen und gießt Sirup darüber. Das schmeckt
richtig gut.\c"
MG08030004,"\h(«Urala»)Ähmm…… als ich zum ersten Mal von den Lands
of Ice hörte, nahm ich an, es sei Übertreibung.
Ich war schockiert, als ich sie sah!\e"
MG08030005,"\h(«Urala»)Mit so viel Eis kann man alle Desserts machen,
die man will! Und man braucht nie wieder etwas
Lauwarmes zu trinken!\e"
MG08030006,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm, vielleicht irre ich mich, aber ich glaube,
Fina regt sich über etwas auf.\e"
MG08030007,"\h(«Urala»)Sie isst normalerweise kaum etwas, aber jetzt
isst sie noch weniger. Ich hoffe, sie ist
wohlauf.\c"
MG08030008,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… ich habe Enrique etwas zu essen
zubereitet, aber er isst es nicht.\e"
MG08030009,"\h(«Urala»)Zuerst dachte ich, es läge an meiner Küche,
aber es hat allen anderen gefallen. Ich hoffe,
Enrique geht es gut.\c"
MG08030010,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… ich möchte Enrique all seine
Lieblingsgerichte machen…… bevor er geht.\e"
MG08030011,"\h(«Urala»)Ich hoffe, er und Moegi können einige Zeit
miteinander verbringen, bevor er geht.\c"
MG08030012,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… ich würde gern eine süße Nachspeise
zubereiten.\e"
MG08030013,"\h(«Urala»)Ich hoffe, dass das Fina ein wenig
aufheitert……\c"
MG08030014,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… Captain, heute werde ich all deine
Lieblingsgerichte kochen……\e"
MG08030015,"\h(«Urala»)Das wird dir gefallen. Und nachdem wir diese
Schlacht gewonnen haben, können wir alle
zurück zur Crescent Isle, um zu feiern!\c"
MG08030016,\h(«Urala»)Was? Wir fahren in den Kontinent hinein?\e
MG08030017,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm……
Ich habe etwas Angst vor der Dunkelheit……
Ich hoffe, wir werden nicht zu lange dort
bleiben……\c"
MG08030018,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm, hör mal, Vyse! Ich bin vielleicht etwas
abergläubisch, aber diese Insel, die sich aus
dem Deep Sky erhoben hat, kann ja wohl keine
gute Sache sein.\e"
MG08030019,\h(«Urala»)Ich habe wirklich Angst.\c
MG08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, ich weiß nicht viel über die
Seefahrt oder was sich außerhalb von Yafutoma
abspielt……\e"
MG08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)Aber ich werde mein Bestes tun, euch allen
zu helfen.\c"
MG08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Ein Kontinent, der mit Eis überzogen ist……
Auf dieser Seite der Welt gibt es mysteriöse
Orte.\c"
MG08070003,\h(«Moegi»)Prinz Enrique hat mir von Drachma erzählt……\e
MG08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich hoffe, er wird seinen Frieden finden.\c"
MG08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Obwohl wir nur durch den Kontinent hindurch-
fahren, regt mich der Gedanke, dass wir nach
Valua fahren, auf.\c"
MG08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Meinen Glückwunsch! Ich habe gehört, ihr habt
jetzt alle Moon Crystals.\e"
MG08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich mache mir aber Sorgen um Fina, weil sie
nicht viel Energie zu haben scheint. Ist sie
vielleicht müde?\c"
MG08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich mache mir Sorgen um Prinz Enrique…… seit
er von Dangral Island zurück ist, ist er
deprimiert.\c"
MG08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, ich entschuldige mich für
mein Benehmen, aber……\e"
MG08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)……ich hatte gehofft, dass etwas mit dem Schiff
sein würde, so dass wir nicht nach Sailors
Island müssen…… und Enrique bleiben kann.\c"
MG08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Prinz Enrique kämpft ganz allein in Valua.
Ich werde ebenfalls mein Bestes tun, um zu
helfen.\c"
MG08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Der Kontinent, der sich aus dem Deep Sky
erhoben hat, ist erschreckend…… Er hat
irgendetwas Bösartiges an sich.\c"
MG08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich dachte, ich hätte Prinz Enrique um
Hilfe rufen hören……\e"
MG08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich sah, wie die Moon Stones auf Valua fielen.
Ich hoffe, Prinz Enrique geht es gut.\c"
MG08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Gehen wir, Captain Vyse. Ich bin kein Matrose,
aber ich werde alles tun, um dir zu helfen.\c"
MG08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)Dieses Schiff ist phänomenal! Es ist, als wäre
man in einem Schloss!\c"
MG08150001,"\h(«Kirala»)Gab es unter all dem Eis Gebäude? Ich möchte
alles darüber wissen, wenn du nicht zu
beschäftigt bist.\c"
MG08150002,"\h(«Kirala»)Ich hörte, dass die Gebäude von der Decke
hingen! Ich wünschte wirklich, ich hätte es
sehen können.\c"
MG08150003,"\h(«Kirala»)Glückwunsch! Ich habe gehört, dass ihr alle……
wie werden sie noch genannt…… ähm, Moon
Crystals gefunden habt!\c"
MG08150004,"\h(«Kirala»)Ich habe gehört, es gäbe ein Gleis in den
Deep Sky hinab. Wie haben die Valuaner die wohl
gebaut?\c"
MG08150005,"\h(«Kirala»)Wenn man an Prinzessin Moegis Zimmer
vorbeikommt, kann man sie weinen hören.\e"
MG08150006,"\h(«Kirala»)Sie versucht, ihre Gefühle zu verbergen, wenn
sie bei uns ist…… es muss wirklich schwer für
sie sein……\c"
MG08150007,"\h(«Kirala»)Was, wir fliegen in den Deep Sky?! Aber……
dort unten gibt es Monster und Gespenster
und alle möglichen schlimmen Sachen!\c"
MG08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)Was für eine Art von verrückter Insel kommt
auch schon nach hunderten von Jahren einfach
aus dem Deep Sky?! Das gefällt mir überhaupt
nicht. Es kann keine gute Sache sein!\c"
MG08150009,"\h(«Kirala»)Uns steht ein Kampf bevor! Sagt Bescheid,
falls ich etwas ausrichten kann!\c"
MG08150010,"\h(«Kirala»)Ich kann's nicht glauben, dass euer Schiff
weder ober- noch unterhalb der Wolken fliegen
kann. Das muss ja unangenehm sein.\c"
MG14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Eine gefrorene Stadt, die unter Eis
begraben ist? Das hört sich unmöglich an!\c"
MG14010001,"\h(«Izmael»)Du willst mir also erzählen, dass alle Gebäude
wie Eiszapfen von der Decke hingen?!\e"
MG14010002,\h(«Izmael»)Das möchte ich sehen!\c
MG14010003,"\h(«Izmael»)In diesem Buch der Schiffspolarität standen
einige erstaunliche Sachen…… aber ist Brabham
nicht unglaublich? Er hat noch immer was auf
dem Kasten!\e"
MG14010004,"\h(«Izmael»)Dank diesem alten Haudegen ist dies das einzige
Schiff außerhalb von Yafutoma, das über den
Wolken fliegen kann!\c"
MG14010005,"\h(«Izmael»)Was ist mit dem Prinzen los?
Hat er Magenschmerzen oder was?\c"
MG14010006,"\h(«Izmael»)Wenn ihr in den Deep Sky abtaucht, müsst ihr
die Druckverschlüsse zumachen.\e"
MG14010007,"\h(«Izmael»)Egal, was im Deep Sky auf uns wartet, die
extrastarken Luken werden uns Schutz
bieten!\c"
MG14010008,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich bin neugierig, wie die Architektur im
Great Silver Shrine aussieht…… ich möchte
es gern mit euch zusammen herausfinden……\e"
MG14010009,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich wette, auf dieser seltsamen Insel gibt
es tonnenweise alte Gebäude. Wenn ich nur
etwas näher heran könnte……\e"
MG14010010,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse! Beeil dich und versetz den Valuanern
einen Tritt in den Hintern, damit wir uns die
Architektur ansehen können!\c"
MG14010011,\h(«Izmael»)Es ist so weit! Holen wir sie uns!\e
MG14010012,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich kann's nicht glauben, dass ich in meinem
Alter noch Kämpfe austrage. Ich versuche nur,
mit Brabham Schritt zu halten. Oh, aber erzähl
ihm nicht, was ich dir gerade gesagt habe.\c"
MG14010013,"\h(«Izmael»)Als ich Enrique zum ersten Mal traf, lehnte
er ständig über der Reling, um sich zu
übergeben. Jetzt er ein richtiger Seemann
geworden!\e"
MG14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich bin beeindruckt davon, dass er den Mut
hat, nach Valua zurückzukehren!\c"
MG14020000,"\h(«Belle»)Tut mir wirklich Leid, Captain…… ich…… ich
bin etwas ungeschickt. Vorhin habe ich auch
noch jemandem eine Kanonenkugel auf den Fuß
fallen lassen!\e"
MG14020001,"\h(«Belle»)Ich werde jedoch mein Bestes tun! Gib mir
einfach ein paar Befehle, und ich werde
versuchen, nichts falsch zu machen!\c"
MG14020002,"\h(«Belle»)Ich war so überrascht zu sehen, dass die
Lands of Ice tatsächlich mit Eis bedeckt waren!
Ich war so schockiert, ich bin fast über Bord
gegangen!\e"
MG14020003,"\h(«Belle»)Als ich mich wieder gefangen hatte, bin ich
auf dem Eis ausgerutscht und hingefallen.
Außerdem habe ich mir dort auch eine Frostbeule
zugezogen.\c"
MG14020004,"\h(«Belle»)Endlich werden wir versuchen, in die Unterwelt
abzutauchen! Ich weiß nicht, ob ich das kann,
aber ich werde so gut graben, wie es geht!\e"
MG14020005,"\h(«Vyse»)Haha…… du brauchst doch nicht zu graben!
Es sind natürliche Öffnungen im Boden, durch
die wir hineinkommen können.\e"
MG14020006,"\h(«Belle»)Wirklich? He…… hihi…… Oh, ähmm…… gut zu
wissen. Ich hatte mich schon gefragt, wie
man sich durch einen Kontinent hindurchgraben
kann……\c"
MG14020007,"\h(«Belle»)Captain, ich glaube, mit Fina stimmt etwas
nicht. Sie ist ja immer recht still, aber so
still nun auch wieder nicht.\e"
MG14020008,"\h(«Belle»)Hoffentlich ist es nicht, weil
ich sie mit Wasser bespritzt habe, als ich
über den Eimer gestolpert bin.\c"
MG14020009,"\h(«Belle»)Ich habe einige Zaubertricks versucht, um
Enrique aufzumuntern, aber……\e"
MG14020010,"\h(«Belle»)……er hat einfach nur dagesessen. Er sah richtig
traurig aus. Ich kann überhaupt nichts richtig
machen.\c"
MG14020011,"\h(«Belle»)Ich bin sicher, Moegi weint innerlich, seit
Enrique fort ist, aber……\e"
MG14020012,"\h(«Belle»)……sie hat noch nicht einmal geweint, als
Enrique das Schiff verließ. Sie ist so
diszipliniert. Ich wünschte, ich könnte mehr
wie sie sein.\c"
MG14020013,"\h(«Belle»)Wo kommt diese Insel her?! Wie kann eine Insel
einfach aus dem Nichts erscheinen?!\e"
MG14020014,"\h(«Belle»)Es hat mich so überrascht, dass ich aus
Versehen einen Haufen Kanonenkugeln umgeworfen
habe. Warum bin ich so ungeschickt?!\c"
MG14020015,"\h(«Belle»)Endlich werden wir versuchen, diese Insel
anzugreifen! Ich weiß, ich bin ungeschickt
und verderbe ständig alles, aber……\e"
MG14020016,"\h(«Belle»)Während meiner Zeit hier auf der Delphinus
habe ich eine Menge gelernt! Ich glaube, ich
werde meine Sache gut machen!\c"
MG14090000,"\h(«Lilly»)Die Lands of Ice…… hört sich so romantisch an.
Welche Art von Menschen hier wohl gelebt hat?\c"
MG14090001,"\h(«Lilly»)Ich poliere den ganzen Tag lang nur
Kanonenkugeln…… Wie soll ich da bloß Männer
kennen lernen?\c"
MG14090002,"\h(«Lilly»)Ich habe gehört, ihr habt alle diese Moon
Crystal-Dinger gefunden. Alle reden sie
davon, wie schön sie sind……\e"
MG14090003,"\h(«Lilly»)Es ist so romantisch…… ich möchte einen Mann,
der bereit ist, alles zu riskieren, um so
etwas Schönes für mich zu finden……\c"
MG14090004,"\h(«Lilly»)Enrique kehrt heim, und Moegi geht nicht
mit ihm?\e"
MG14090005,"\h(«Lilly»)Wenn ich an ihrer Stelle wäre, würde ich
niemals die Seite meines Geliebten verlassen.\c"
MG14090006,"\h(«Lilly»)Wo genau ist Finas Heimat?
Hast du ihre Familie und so kennen
gelernt?\e"
MG14090007,"\h(«Lilly»)Hmm…… ich möchte wetten, dass du ein wenig
nervös warst, als du mitgingst, was, Vyse?
Ich meine…… du und Fina seid euch etwas näher
gekommen…… nicht?\c"
MG14090008,"\h(«Lilly»)Dieser gut aussehende Admiral wohnt auf dieser
Insel, die sich aus dem Deep Sky erhoben hat?\e"
MG14090009,"\h(«Lilly»)Ich sag's ja…… mit den gut Aussehenden stimmt
immer irgendwas nicht. Warum kann ich nicht
einmal einen normalen Typen kennen lernen?\c"
MG14090010,"\h(«Lilly»)Los, fangen wir an! He…… wenn ich die
Piratin werde, die zur Rettung der Welt
beigetragen hat, werden mir die Männer
nicht mehr widerstehen können!\e"
MG14090011,"\h(«Lilly»)Ich werde es mal versuchen!
Ich weiß, dass wir es schaffen können,
Captain Vyse!\c"
MG14090012,"\h(«Lilly»)Wir fliegen wieder in den Deep Sky hinein?!
Müssen wir das tun?\e"
MG14090013,"\h(«Lilly»)Ich hatte gehofft, dass wir während unseres
Abenteuers etwas…… nettere Orte aufsuchen
würden.\c"
MG14090014,"\h(«Lilly»)Enrique wirkt dieser Tage so…… so…… tapfer.
Ich finde, das macht ihn so süß.\c"
MG14100000,"\h(«Nara»)Einfach hier zu sitzen…… und bei dem schönen
Himmel Kanonenkugeln zu putzen……
das entspannt total.\c"
MG14100001,"\h(«Nara»)Dieser Drache war wirklich mächtig.
War das einer von diesen Gigas, von denen ihr
gesprochen habt?\c"
MG14100002,"\h(«Nara»)Ihr wollt euch in einen valuanischen Stützpunkt
einschleichen und etwas stehlen? Mein Gott……
wenn ich an eurer Stelle wäre, dann wäre ich
furchtbar nervös……\c"
MG14100003,"\h(«Nara»)Enrique fühlt sich seit kurzem nicht in seinem
Element…… Vielleicht sollte ich ihn bitten, zu
uns nach draußen zu kommen und ein paar
Kanonenkugeln zu putzen!\c"
MG14100004,"\h(«Nara»)Obwohl er in Valua ist und sie hier, kämpfen
beide für dasselbe Ziel!\e"
MG14100005,"\h(«Nara»)Das ist so romantisch……
Moegi, gibt nicht auf! Enrique liebt dich!\c"
MG14100006,"\h(«Nara»)Diese Insel lässt mich erschaudern…… einfach
so aus den Wolken heraus zu erscheinen……\e"
MG14100007,"\h(«Nara»)Ich bin der Ansicht, wir sollten zur Sicherheit
ein paar Kugeln auf die Insel abschießen.\c"
MG14100008,\h(«Nara»)Endlich werden wir Ramirez gegenüberstehen……\e
MG14100009,"\h(«Nara»)Wir haben genug Kanonenkugeln, um jeden Kampf
zu überstehen. Benutze so viel, wie es geht,
Captain Vyse!\c"
MGp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Esperanza……
Ich kann's nicht glauben, dass wir bis zum
südlichsten Ende von Nasr reisen müssen……
das ist furchtbar weit.\e"
MGp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Nun, ich wusste, dass es nicht einfach sein
würde. Doch ich nehme an, die Welt zu retten,
wird nie einfach sein.\c"
MGp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Vor Jahren hat Valua eine gesamte Flotte
entsandt, um die Dark Rift zu passieren.
Alle Schiffe wurden vernichtet……\c"
MGp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Man kann sich kaum vorstellen, dass wir gerade
aus der Dark Rift herauskommen. Diese Länder
sind wunderschön!\e"
MGp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Meinen Glückwunsch, Vyse! Du bist der erste
Kapitän, der sein Schiff durch die Dark Rift
gesteuert hat.\c"
MGp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich habe noch nie gesehen, dass ein Schiff
so an Höhe gewinnt!\e"
MGp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich möchte gern mal wissen, was für einen
Motor die benutzen……\c"
MGp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Gemäß der “Sphärischen Welttheorie” soll diese
Welt rund sein, aber niemand konnte es je
beweisen.\e"
MGp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Wenn wir weiter nach Osten fliegen und Crescent
Isle sehen, dann können wir tatsächlich
beweisen, dass diese Theorie stimmt.\c"
MGp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)Die Valuan Armada hat zahlreiche
Forschungsgruppen zu den Lands of Ice entsandt,
aber……\e"
MGp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Es ist ihnen nicht gelungen, das Eis zu
durchbrechen, also konnten sie auch nie
erforschen, was darunter liegt.\c"
MGp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Wir haben uns den Purple Moon Crystal geholt,
und jetzt sollten wir nach Crescent Isle
zurückfahren. Nur Drachma tut mir Leid……\e"
MGp0040016,\h(«Enrique»)Der Kontinent von Valua ist voller Cañons.\e
MGp0040017,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich nehme an, dass es unterhalb Valuas auch
viele Risse und Spalten gibt. Es muss doch
einen Weg in den Maw of Tartas geben.\c"
MGp0040018,"\h(«Enrique»)Wir haben endlich alle Moon Crystals gesammelt.
Kehren wir nach Crescent Isle zurück.\c"
MGp0040019,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich frage mich, was Galcian vorhat……\c"
MGp0040020,\h(«Enrique»)……\c
MGp0040021,"\h(«Enrique»)Ein Entwurf, der es Schiffen erlaubt, in den
Deep Sky abzutauchen…… was hat die Armada vor?\c"
MGp0040022,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich werde es vermissen, mit dir
und deiner Crew zu segeln, Vyse. Es fällt mir
schwer, es zuzugeben, aber ich werde sogar
Aika und ihr ständiges Necken vermissen.\c"
MGp0040023,"\h(«Enrique»)Nun gut, ich werde zurückkehren…… hoffentlich
bald.\c"
MGp0040024,"\h(«Enrique»)Wir müssen Ramirez aufhalten! Vyse, ich weiß,
es wird uns gelingen!\c"
MGp0040025,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, lässt du mich mit euch nach Soltis
aufbrechen?\e"
MGp0040026,"\h(«Was wirst du sagen?»)“Natürlich.”
“Wir schaffen das schon.”\e"
MGp0040027,"\h(«Vyse»)Natürlich kommst du mit!
Ohne dich hätten wir nie die Delphinus
bekommen. Gehen wir!\e"
MGp0040028,"\h(«Enrique»)Danke, Vyse!
Es ist eine Ehre, dich begleiten zu dürfen!\e"
MGp0040029,\h( )Enrique ist zur Gruppe gestoßen.\c
MGp0040030,"\h(«Enrique»)Also, lass mich nur wissen, ob ich behilflich
sein kann!\c"
MGf1000000,"\h(«Polly»)Ich weiß, dass mein Mann irgendwo…… dort
draußen ist……\c"
MGf1000001,"\h(«Polly»)Es muss hart gewesen sein, so ganz allein
an einem dunklen und Furcht erregenden Ort……\e"
MGf1000002,"\h(«Polly»)Ich bin froh, dass ich mit dir gekommen bin,
Vyse! Ich danke dir!\c"
MGf1000003,"\h(«Polly»)Der Gedanke, dass sich der gesamte Kontinent
von Valua über uns befindet, erfüllt mich nicht
gerade mit Vertrauen.\c"
MGf1000004,"\h(«Polly»)Hier unten ist es so gruselig. Unser Proviant
wird schlecht, wenn wir noch länger
hier bleiben.\c"
MGf4090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Von diesem grauenhaften Ort kann ich die
Stimme des Red Moon nicht vernehmen. Ich kann
dir deine Zukunft nicht voraussagen, bis wir
von hier fortgehen.\c"
MGf5030000,"\h(«Merida»)Hier unten ist es grauenhaft. Ich hoffe, wir
können bald hier weg……\c"
MGf5030001,"\h(«Merida»)Ich hasse die Valuaner. Ich möchte so schnell
wie möglich von hier fort.\c"
MGf5030002,"\h(«Merida»)Dieser Ort ist ziemlich unangenehm…… Hier
treffen verschiedene Energien aufeinander.
Die Luft ist auf eine üble Art schwer……\c"
MGf6310000,"\h(«Osman»)Lasst uns schnell hier abhauen! Was sollen
wir machen, wenn wir irgendwo gegen fahren?\c"
MGf6310001,"\h(«Osman»)Ich wäre viel lieber an einem fröhlicheren
Ort. Niemand möchte etwas kaufen, wenn
ihm die Angst im Nacken sitzt.\c"
MGf6310002,"\h(«Osman»)An diesem Ort ist mir nicht geheuer! Und wie
soll ich hier unten Geld machen?!\c"
MGf6330000,"\h(«Khazim»)Männer! Wir müssen uns anstrengen, damit wir
Valua besiegen können!\e"
MGf6330001,\h(«Khazims Männer»)Zu Befehl!\c
MGf6330002,"\h(«Khazim»)Wir fliegen also nach Valua hinein. Ich frage
mich, ob man diesen Ort von innen zerstören
kann.\c"
MGf6330003,"\h(«Khazim»)Verdammt, ist es hier gruselig! Gespenster und
Pfefferschoten aus Nasr sind die zwei Dinge,
die ich am meisten hasse!\e"
MGf6330004,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Zu Befehl…… Khazim, Pfefferschoten aus
Nasr soll man nicht essen. Sie werden
dazu benutzt, die Monster aus der Wüste
fern zu halten.\c"
MGf6340000,\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Er brüllt uns den ganzen Tag lang an!\c
MGf6340001,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich je das Innere
von Valua kennen lernen würde, und jetzt, wo
es der Fall ist, wünschte ich, dass ich es nie
getan hätte.\c"
MGf6340002,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Sagt man nicht, dass die Unterwelt voll von
Geistern sei?\c"
MGf6350000,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Es ist seltsam, wenn Khazim mich nicht jede
Sekunde anbrüllt. Es fing mir an zu gefallen.\c"
MGf6350001,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Ich finde es nicht gerade sehr erbaulich,
im Innern von Valua zu sein.\c"
MGf6350002,"\h(«Khazims Kanonier»)Khazim hatte immer schon Angst vor Gespenstern.
Ich glaube, er hat als kleines Kind zu viele
Geschichten gehört.\c"
MGf8030000,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… ich vermisse den freien Blick in den
Himmel……\e"
MGf8030001,"\h(«Urala»)Normalerweise schaue ich gern im Schiff aus
dem Fenster, aber im Moment möchte ich nicht
wissen, was da draußen ist.\c"
MGf8030002,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… stimmt es, dass es hier eine Menge
Gespenster gibt?\e"
MGf8030003,"\h(«Was wirst du sagen?»)“Ja, das stimmt.”
“Nein, das ist nur Gerede.”\e"
MGf8030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, das stimmt. Es gibt eine Menge grauenhafter
Kreaturen dort draußen vor dem Fenster.\e"
MGf8030005,"\h(«Urala»)Uhh…… ähm…… Vyse, bitte geh nicht auf die Brücke
zurück…… lass mich hier unten nicht allein……\c"
MGf8030006,"\h(«Vyse»)Nein, das ist nur Gerede. Mach dir keine
Sorgen. Dir passiert nichts.\e"
MGf8030007,"\h(«Urala»)Danke, Vyse, ich fühle mich ein bisschen
besser…… nicht vollkommen…… aber ein bisschen.
Es wird schon gehen. Aber können wir bald
abfahren?\c"
MGf8030008,"\h(«Urala»)Draußen gibt es eine Menge versunkener Schiffe.
Vyse, ich habe solche Angst.\c"
MGf8150000,"\h(«Kirala»)Also, Valua wurde auf einem riesigen, schroffen
Felsen gebaut, wo es immer dunkel und stürmisch
ist…… ich bin beeindruckt.\c"
MGf8150001,"\h(«Kirala»)Als ich klein war, habe ich immer
herumgealbert, und meine Eltern sind immer
wütend geworden……\e"
MGf8150002,"\h(«Kirala»)Sie sagten immer, sie würden mich in den
Deep Sky werfen…… ich hätte nie gedacht,
dass ich einmal wirklich hierher kommen
würde.\c"
MGf8150003,"\h(«Kirala»)Die Winde der Dark Rift sind unglaublich!
Jetzt weiß ich auch, warum die Leute aus dem
Westen nie nach Yafutoma kommen!\c"
MGf4010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam Baka Bam! Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass es
solche Höhlen in Valua gibt!\c"
MGf4010001,\h(«Izmael»)Dies ist ein Furcht erregender Ort.\e
MGf4010002,"\h(«Izmael»)Wie deprimierend. Ich bin so schon alt genug……
Ich möchte nicht unbedingt wissen, wie es
in der Unterwelt aussieht.\c"
MGf4010003,"\h(«Izmael»)Die Leute versuchen schon seit langer Zeit,
durch die Dark Rift zu kommen, schon seit ich
so alt war wie du. Ha! Das ist lange her!\c"
MGf4020000,"\h(«Belle»)Oh, unglaublich! Ich habe alle meine
Süßigkeiten an Deck gelassen!\c"
MGf4020001,"\h(«Belle»)Captain, ich glaube nicht, dass es im Deep
Sky Gespenster gibt.\e"
MGf4020002,"\h(«Belle»)Oh, jetzt, wo ich Gespenster gesagt habe,
muss ich wieder daran denken! Mann, ich
jage mir selbst Angst ein!\c"
MGf4020003,"\h(«Belle»)Hoppla, ich habe die ganze Wäsche zum Trocknen
an Deck gelassen!\e"
MGf4020004,"\h(«Belle»)Sie wird wahrscheinlich längst wieder
schmutzig sein von der Luft da draußen……
Ach, ich werd's nie lernen!\c"
MGf4f90000,"\h(«Lilly»)Ich habe gehört, dass Teile von Valua ganz
nett sind, aber selbst die sind kein Spaß.\c"
MGf4f90001,"\h(«Lilly»)Das ist ein deprimierender Ort.
Ich mag Orte wie diesen nicht.\e"
MGf4f90002,"\h(«Lilly»)Wenn wir hier wegkommen, können wir
anschließend nach Ixa'taka, damit ich das
Essen dort probieren kann?\c"
MGf4f90003,"\h(«Lilly»)Die Dark Rift ist wirklich Furcht erregend.
Schau dir all die Schiffe an, die hier zerstört
wurden. Lasst uns rasch verschwinden.\c"
MGf41f0000,"\h(«Nara»)Ich bin gerne im Dunkeln. Ich finde es
romantisch.\c"
MGf41f0001,"\h(«Nara»)Ich erwarte immer Gespenster. Ich habe
wirklich Angst, aber Angst kriegen ist
aufregend.\c"
MGf41f0002,"\h(«Nara»)So viele Abenteurer sind hier in der Dark Rift
gestorben…… Dieser Ort lässt mich erschaudern.\c"
MGf4030000,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Wieviel Erz wohl in diesen Wänden steckt.
Denk nur an die Waffen, die ich damit
herstellen könnte.\c"
MGf4030001,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Deep Sky ist kein Ort für die Lebenden.
Hier gehören wir nicht hin.\c"
MGf4030002,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Wenn du lernst, zu meditieren, wird der
schlimmste Sturm zur angenehmen Brise.\c"
MGf4040000,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich Polly je
wieder sehe! Ich bin so glücklich!\c"
MGf4040001,"\h(«Robinson»)Diese düstere Höhle ist noch immer besser als
die Dark Rift.\c"
MGf4040002,"\h(«Robinson»)Mir gefällt es hier wirklich nicht! Dieser
Ort ist schlimmer als die Dark Rift.\e"
MGf4040003,"\h(«Robinson»)Wenn ich hier gestrandet wäre, hätte ich es
keinen Tag lang ausgehalten.\c"
MGf4040004,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Das ist also der Maw of Tartas. Wenn die
Geologen, mit denen ich zur Schule gegangen
bin, wüssten, dass ich hier bin, wären sie
sicher neidisch.\c"
MGf4040005,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Dieser Ort ist gefährlicher, als alle
Wissenschaftler vorausgesagt haben. Hier
unten brodelt eine Menge Energie……\c"
MGf4040006,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Es gibt Mythen über einen Black Moon, der
sich am Himmel neben den anderen befand.\e"
MGf4040007,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Vielleicht ist dieser Black Moon für die
immense Kraft und den Druck hier unten
verantwortlich……\c"
MGff030000,"\h(«Drachma»)Ich kann nicht einfach herumsitzen und Valua
alles zerstören lassen! Ich möchte euch helfen,
sie zu bekämpfen! Wir haben es doch schon so
weit geschafft!\c"
MGff030001,"\h(«Drachma»)Ihr meint, wir fahren in diesen Kontinent
hinein?
Mann, Junge, manchmal glaube ich, dass dir
da oben ein paar Moon Stones fehlen.\e"
MGff030002,"\h(«Drachma»)Aber wenn ihr darauf besteht, dass ich
mitkomme, dann tu ich es auch.\e"
MGff030003,"\h(«Was willst du tun?»)“Ja, es wäre toll, wenn du mitkommen könntest.”
“Es ist am besten, wenn du hier bleibst.”\e"
MGff030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, es wäre toll, wenn du mit uns kämst.
Wir könnten deinen starken Arm schon gebrauchen,
um damit ein paar Schädel einzuschlagen.\e"
MGff030005,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumpf…… na, dann werde ich mit dir mitkommen,
Junge. Ich…… hätte nie gedacht, dass ich
noch einmal zusammen mit dir kämpfen würde……\c"
MGff030006,\h( )Drachma ist zu deiner Gruppe gestoßen.\c
MGff030007,"\h(«Drachma»)Hrumpf! Das passt mir gut, Junge.
Aber sag Bescheid, wenn du deine Meinung
änderst……\c"
MGff050000,"\h(«Gilder»)Jetzt wollen wir also versuchen, durch die
Dark Rift zu fahren? Vyse, du hast vielleicht
einen Nerv! Auf deinem Schiff langweilt man
sich nie.\c"
MGff050001,"\h(«Gilder»)Ich erinnere mich, von den Spalten unter Valua
gehört zu haben, aber ich hätte nie gedacht,
dass ich sie je zu Gesicht bekommen würde.\c"
MGff050002,"\h(«Gilder»)Der Gedanke, Deep Sky zu erforschen, hört sich
attraktiver an als eine Taverne voller Frauen
aus Nasr.\c"
MGff050003,"\h(«Gilder»)Also, es ist so weit. Von dem Ausgang dieser
Schlacht hängt ab, ob man uns als Märtyrer
oder als Helden in Erinnerung behält. Ich
wäre lieber ein Held.\c"
MGff050004,"\h(«Gilder»)He, Vyse.
Du willst mich doch nicht einfach hier lassen?
Du kannst nicht allein den ganzen Spaß haben!\e"
MGff050005,"\h(«Was tun?»)“Komm schon, Gilder, gehen wir!”
“Mir wäre es lieber, wenn du hierbleibst.”\e"
MGff050006,"\h(«Vyse»)Komm schon, Gilder, gehen wir!\e"
MGff050007,"\h(«Gilder»)Das höre ich gerne!
Gehen wir und zeigen wir ihnen, was wir
können!\c"
MGff050008,\h( )Gilder ist zur Gruppe hinzugestoßen.\c
MGff050009,"\h(«Gilder»)Du brichst mir das Herz! In Ordnung, ich bleibe
hier. Sag Bescheid, wenn du mich brauchst.
Oh, und sollte Clara nach mir fragen, dann
weißt du nicht, wo ich bin.\c"
MGii010000,"\h(«Aika»)Hier ist es toll! Es gibt sogar eine Küche!
Ich glaube, hier wird es mir gefallen.\c"
MGi1000000,"\h(«Polly»)Wenn man bedenkt, dass sie sich auf einem
Schiff befindet, ist diese Küche wirklich
beeindruckend.\e"
MGi1000001,"\h(«Polly»)Hier gibt es genug Proviant und Utensilien,
um beste Arbeit zu leisten.\c"
MGi6310000,"\h(«Osman»)Ich mag dieses Schiff sehr, es ist stark und
schön…… so in etwa wie ich.\c"
MGi6310001,"\h(«Osman»)Wenn mein Schiff nicht niedergebrannt wäre,
hätte ich euch 100.000 Goldstücke geliehen……\e"
MGi6310002,"\h(«Osman»)20% auf 100.000 Goldstücke…… Hm…… das wäre
ein schöner Profit gewesen.\c"
MG14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass ich jemals wieder
blauen Himmel sehen würde…… ich hätte fast
vergessen, dass der Himmel so blau ist.\e"
MG14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich habe Polly und Anne zurückgelassen,
um meinen Träumen nachzujagen……\e"
MG14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)An einem so furchtbaren Ort gestrandet zu sein……
mein Gedächtnis zu verlieren…… ich bin sicher,
die Monde wollten mich dafür bestrafen, dass ich
meine Familie vernachlässigt habe.\c"
MG14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich kann es nicht fassen, dass ich Polly
vergessen habe, als ich mein Gedächtnis verlor.\e"
MG14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)Aber tief in meinem Innern fühlte ich eine
Leere. Das Einzige, was sie je ausfüllte,
war weg.\c"
MG14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)Als ich auf Sailors Island war, war Polly
das Einzige, das mich davon abhielt, zur See
zu gehen. Sie war das Beste, was mir je
widerfahren ist.\e"
MG14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)Da meine Erinnerung wiedergekehrt ist, 
werde ich sie nie wieder vernachlässigen.
Lieber sterbe ich. Ich weiß jetzt, wie wichtig
mir Polly ist……\c"
MG14040007,"\h(«Robinson»)Ein Schiff, das in der Lage ist, in Deep Sky
abzutauchen, was? Das erinnert mich an die
Zeit, als ich mich selbst der Dark Rift
stellte……\c"
MG14040008,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich möchte, dass der valuanische Admiral, der
Crescent Island angegriffen hat, dafür bezahlt!
Polly hätte bei dem Angriff getötet werden
können!\e"
MG14040009,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich kann es mir nicht leisten, Polly noch
einmal zu verlieren……\c"
MG14040010,"\h(«Robinson»)Alles, was mir wichtig ist, befindet sich im
Mid Ocean. Polly, Anne, meine Taverne……\e"
MG14040011,"\h(«Robinson»)Diese Insel erschien genau in der Mitte.
Wir müssen sie zerstören!\c"
MG14040012,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich kann nicht sagen, dass ich stark genug
bin, die Welt zu retten. Ich gebe auch nicht
vor, ein Held zu sein.\e"
MG14040013,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich werde jedoch bis zu meinem Tod kämpfen,
um Polly und Anne zu retten…… und die Welt
zu erhalten, in der sie leben……\c"
MS00040000,\h(«Pow»)¡Pow pow! ¡Pow pow!\c
MS01000002,"\h(«Polly»)He oído que Esperanza está habitada por ex-
soldados Valuan y marinos que perdieron sus
navíos en la Gruta Oscura.\e"
MS01000003,\h(«Polly»)Quizá mi marido esté allí.\c
MS01000004,"\h(«Polly»)Esperaba con anhelo que mi marido estuviera en
Esperanza, pero nadie por allí sabe nada de él.\e"
MS01000005,"\h(«Polly»)Sólo espero que no muriera al intentar atravesar
la Gruta Oscura.\c"
MS01000006,"\h(«Polly»)¡No puedo creer que hayamos encontrado a
Robinson!
¡Es un milagro que aún esté vivo!\e"
MS01000007,"\h(«Polly»)Vyse…… Gracias…… Me alegro tanto de haber ido
contigo.\c"
MS01000008,\h(«Polly»)Conseguimos atravesar la Gruta Oscura……\e
MS01000009,"\h(«Polly»)Anhelaba que mi marido siguiera vivo…… pero
después de ver todos esos restos de barcos
naufragados…… No sé qué pensar.\c"
MS01000010,\h(«Polly»)¿Qué pasa ahí?\c
MS01000011,"\h(«Polly»)¿Así que volvemos a la Isla de la Luna? Seguro
que mi marido se encontrará mucho mejor cuando
empiece a cocinar para él.\c"
MS01000012,"\h(«Polly»)Hemos conseguido atravesar la Gruta Oscura, pero
no hemos encontrado señales de mi marido.
Había tantos restos de naufragios……\c"
MS01000013,"\h(«Polly»)Nos dirigimos a las Tierras de Hielo, ¿no? Voy a
cocinar una sopita bien caliente para toda la
tripulación.\c"
MS01000014,"\h(«Polly»)Tengo la corazonada de que mi marido sigue
vivo…… en algún sitio…… Sé que no estaba en las
Tierras de Hielo.\c"
MS01000015,"\h(«Polly»)Vamos hacia el Cielo Profundo, ¿no? Espero que
el navío soporte la presión.\c"
MS01000016,"\h(«Polly»)¿Así que vamos a la zona que se encuentra debajo
de Valua?
Nunca pensé que iría a parar allí.\c"
MS01000017,"\h(«Polly»)Fina quiere aparentar que nada le preocupa, pero
sé que está disimulando. En el fondo está muy
triste.\e"
MS01000018,"\h(«Polly»)Antes comía poco, pero es que ahora apenas toca
la comida.\c"
MS01000019,"\h(«Polly»)Hemos recorrido el mundo entero y aún no he
encontrado a mi marido. No voy a perder la
esperanza. Sé que está…… en alguna parte.\c"
MS01000020,"\h(«Polly»)Enrique está muy triste. Antes se pasaba el día
mareado, pero incluso entonces comía más que
ahora.\e"
MS01000021,"\h(«Polly»)Creo que ha quedado muy afectado
emocionalmente.\c"
MS01000022,"\h(«Polly»)Hemos estado por todo el mundo, y aún no sé
dónde está mi marido. Tengo la sensación de que
aún está vivo…… ¿pero dónde?\e"
MS01000023,\h(«Polly»)He oído que Enrique nos deja dentro de poco……\e
MS01000024,"\h(«Polly»)Hasta que llegue ese momento, le voy a cocinar
todos sus platos preferidos.\c"
MS01000025,"\h(«Polly»)Un continente antiguo se elevó de debajo del
Cielo Profundo…… en el Océano Medio…… Aunque lo
vi con mis propios ojos, aún no puedo creerlo.\c"
MS01000026,"\h(«Polly»)¡Cuando vuelvas te cocinaré lo que quieras!
¡Buena suerte, Vyse!\c"

Hielo?\e"

MS04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)Al llegar a tierra, en la oscuridad, unos ojos
malvados estarán aguardando tu llegada.

todos los pobres? Creo que voy a quedarme en el
barco.\c"

Gruta Oscura. El viento lo dañará tanto que su
valor de reventa va a bajar mucho.\c"

¡Es el fin del mundo!\e"

oro!\c"
MS06310022,"\h(«Osman»)¡Desde que apareció esa isla, los negocios ya no
son lo mismo! ¡Ve inmediatamente y destrúyela!\e"

demostrarte mi gratitud!\c"

reponer fuerzas! ¡Tenéis que guardar vuestras
energías para la batalla!\e"
MS06330001,"\h(«Los hombres de Khazim»)¡Sí, señor!\c"
MS06330002,"\h(«Khazim»)¡¿Nos están abordando?! ¡Pero están demasiado
cerca para usar los cañones! ¡A por ellos,
Vyse!\c"
MS06330003,"\h(«Khazim»)¡No puedo creer que hayan escapado! ¡Y encima se
marcharon tan panchos! ¡No les hemos acertado ni
una vez!\e"
MS06330004,"\h(«Khazim»)¡La próxima vez, se van a enterar!
¡Vamos a agujerearles!\c"
MS06330005,"\h(«Khazim»)¿Un continente de hielo? La verdad es que es la
primera vez que veo el hielo……\e"
MS06330006,"\h(«Khazim»)He oído que al Nasultán le gusta comer hielo
picado, pero es tan difícil de encontrar que muy
pocos en Nasr han llegado a ver el hielo.\c"
MS06330007,"\h(«Khazim»)¡Tenemos que estar en forma para nuestra próxima
batalla!\e"
MS06330008,"\h(«Los hombres de Khazim»)¡Sí, Capitán! ¡A por ellos!\c"

¡Khazim se pasa la vida echándonos la bronca!\c"
MS06340001,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¡No puedo creer que esos tipos del extraño
navío-dragón nos hayan atacado!\c"
MS06340002,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)No esperaba encontrarme Piratas Aéreos en este
lado del mundo.\c"
MS06340003,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¿Un continente de hielo?
No puedo ni imaginármelo.\c"
MS06340004,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¡No puedo creer que un continente surja del
Cielo Profundo! ¡Ha sido la cosa más increíble
que he visto en mi vida!\c"
MS06340005,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¡Los cañones están preparados, Capitán!\c"
MS06350000,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)Es un poco raro…… No tener a Khazim detrás
gritándole a uno todo el día.\c"
MS06350001,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¡Una emboscada! ¡A la cubierta, pronto!\c"
MS06350002,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)La verdad, pensaba que no habría nada al otro
lado de la Gruta Oscura. ¡Me quedé de piedra
cuando vi a los Piratas Aéreos!\c"
MS06350003,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)Ni siquiera había visto el hielo. El único lugar
donde hay hielo es en Nasr, en la sala de hielo
del Palacio del Nasultán.\c"
MS06350004,\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¿Está Galcian ahí?\c
MS06350005,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¡Vamos a vengarnos de lo que nos hicieron en
Nasrad! ¡Estoy impaciente por atacar!\c"
MS08030000,"\h(«Urala»)Me da un poco de miedo. ¡Es la primera vez en mi
vida que salgo de Yafutoma!\e"
MS08030001,"\h(«Urala»)¡Espero que al resto de tu tripulación le guste
la comida Yafutoman tanto como a Aika!\c"
MS08030002,"\h(«Urala»)Aún me cuesta creer que haya un continente
completamente helado.\e"
MS08030003,"\h(«Urala»)En Yafutoma…… se coge nieve de las montañas y se
le echa sirope de sabores encima.
Está riquísimo.\c"
MS08030004,"\h(«Urala»)Umm…… la primera vez que oí hablar de las
Tierras de Hielo, creí que estaban exagerando.
¡Me quedé helada cuando las vi!\e"
MS08030005,"\h(«Urala»)Con todo ese hielo, se podrían hacer tantísimos
postres. ¡Y no vas a necesitar beber algo
caliente nunca más!\e"
MS08030006,"\h(«Urala»)Puede que me equivoque, pero creo que Fina está
preocupada por algo.\e"
MS08030007,"\h(«Urala»)No suele comer mucho normalmente, pero ahora
todavía menos. Espero que no se encuentre mal.\c"
MS08030008,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… He hecho un poco de comida para Enrique,
pero no se la ha comido.\e"
MS08030009,"\h(«Urala»)Al principio, pensé que era mi forma de cocinar,
pero a todos los demás sí que les gusta mi
comida. Espero que Enrique esté bien.\c"
MS08030010,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… Quiero cocinar todos los platos favoritos
de Enrique…… antes de que se marche.\e"
MS08030011,"\h(«Urala»)Espero que Moegi y él puedan pasar algún tiempo
a solas, antes de que se vaya.\c"
MS08030012,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… Estoy pensando en hacer un postre muy
dulce.\e"
MS08030013,\h(«Urala»)Espero que Fina se anime un poco con eso……\c
MS08030014,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… Capitán, hoy voy a cocinar todos tus platos
favoritos……\e"
MS08030015,"\h(«Urala»)Te van a encantar. ¡Y después de ganar esta
batalla, podemos volver a la Isla de la Luna
para celebrarlo!\c"
MS08030016,\h(«Urala»)¿Qué? ¿Vamos al interior del continente?\e
MS08030017,"\h(«Urala»)Um……
Me da un poco de miedo la oscuridad…… Espero no
que no estemos allí mucho tiempo……\c"
MS08030018,"\h(«Urala»)Vyse, perdona un momento. Puede que sea un poco
supersticiosa, pero no creo que esa isla que ha
surgido del Cielo Profundo nos traiga suerte.\e"
MS08030019,\h(«Urala»)Me da mucho miedo.\c
MS08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Capitán Vyse, no sé mucho de navegación, ni
siquiera del mundo que hay fuera de Yafutoma……\e"
MS08070001,\h(«Moegi»)Pero voy a intentar ayudaros en lo que pueda.\c
MS08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Un continente cubierto de hielo…… En este lado
del mundo hay lugares muy misteriosos.\c"
MS08070003,\h(«Moegi»)El Príncipe Enrique me contó lo de Drachma……\e
MS08070004,\h(«Moegi»)Espero que pueda encontrar la paz.\c
MS08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Aunque sólo estamos atravesando el continente,
la idea de ir a Valua me desagrada
enormemente.\c"
MS08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)¡Enhorabuena! ¡He oído que habéis reunido todos
los Cristales Lunares!\e"
MS08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Pero estoy preocupada por Fina, parece abatida y
agotada. ¿Está cansada o algo así?\c"
MS08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Estoy preocupada por el Príncipe Enrique……
Ha estado deprimido desde que volvió de Isla
Dangral.\c"
MS08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Capitán Vyse, pido disculpas por cómo me siento,
pero……\e"
MS08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)Tenía la esperanza de que le pasara algo al
navío, y no pudiéramos llegar a la Isla Los
Marinos…… para que Enrique se quedara.\c"
MS08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)El Príncipe Enrique está luchando solo en Valua.
Haré todo lo que pueda para ayudarle.\c"
MS08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Ese continente que surgió del Cielo Profundo me
da mucho miedo…… Hay algo tenebroso en él.\c"
MS08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)Me pareció oír los fritos del Príncipe Enrique
en mis sueños……\e"
MS08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Vi cómo las Piedras Lunares cayeron sobre Valua.
Espero que Enrique esté bien.\c"
MS08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Vamos, Capitán Vyse. No soy marinera, pero estoy
dispuesta a hacer lo que sea para ayudar.\c"
MS08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)¡Este navío es increíble! ¡Me siento como si
estuviera dentro de un castillo!\c"
MS08150001,"\h(«Kirala»)¿Edificaron bajo el hielo? Cuando tengas un
rato, ¿me lo contarás todo?\c"
MS08150002,"\h(«Kirala»)¡He oído que los edificios cuelgan del techo!
Ojalá hubiera estado allí para verlo.\c"
MS08150003,"\h(«Kirala»)¡Enhorabuena! Me han contado que al fin has
encontrado todos los…… como se llamaban……
¡Ah, sí! ¡Los Cristales Lunares!\c"
MS08150004,"\h(«Kirala»)He oído que hay un raíl que baja hasta el Cielo
Profundo. Me pregunto cómo lo pudieron hacer los
Valuan.\c"
MS08150005,"\h(«Kirala»)Al pasar junto a la habitación de la Princesa
Moegi, se pueden oír sus sollozos.\e"
MS08150006,"\h(«Kirala»)Cuando está delante de nosotros intenta
ocultarlo…… Debe ser muy duro para ella……\c"
MS08150007,"\h(«Kirala»)¡¿Que vamos a entrar en el Cielo Profundo?!
¡Pero…… habrá monstruos y fantasmas y todo ese
tipo de cosas!\c"
MS08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)¡¿Qué clase de isla surgiría del Cielo Profundo
después de cientos de años?! Esto no me hace
ninguna gracia. ¡No puede ser nada bueno!\c"
MS08150009,"\h(«Kirala»)¡Se aproxima una batalla! ¡Si puedo ayudar en
algo, me avisas!\c"
MS08150010,"\h(«Kirala»)No puedo creer que tu navío no pudiera volar ni
por encima ni por debajo de las nubes.
¡Tuvo que ser un gran inconveniente!\c"
MS14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)¿Una ciudad congelada, enterrada bajo el hielo?
¡Eso suena imposible!\c"
MS14010001,"\h(«Izmael»)¡¿Me estás diciendo que todos los edificios
colgaban del techo como estalactitas?!\e"
MS14010002,\h(«Izmael»)¡Tendría que verlo para creerlo!\c
MS14010003,"\h(«Izmael»)Ese Libro del Polo decía cosas realmente
asombrosas…… ¿Y qué me dices de Brabham?
¡Aún le queda algo de cerebro en ese viejo coco!\e"
MS14010004,"\h(«Izmael»)¡Gracias a ese viejo, este navío es el único
fuera de las fronteras Yafutoman que puede volar
por encima de las nubes!\c"
MS14010005,"\h(«Izmael»)¿Qué le pasa al príncipe?
¿Es que le duele el estómago o algo así?\c"
MS14010006,"\h(«Izmael»)Cuando bajes a las profundidades del Cielo
Profundo, no te olvides de cerrar las
compuertas. ¡Si perdemos presión, será el fin!\e"
MS14010007,"\h(«Izmael»)No se sabe lo que puede haber ahí abajo, ¡así
que ten mucho cuidado!\c"
MS14010008,"\h(«Izmael»)Me gustaría saber cómo es la arquitectura del
Gran Relicario de Plata…… Me encantaría verlo
con vosotros……\e"
MS14010009,"\h(«Izmael»)¡Seguro que hay toneladas de viejos edificios en
Soltis! ¡Estoy ansioso por ver cómo fueron
construidos!\e"
MS14010010,"\h(«Izmael»)¡Genial! ¡Ahora me ha entrado el gusanillo!
¡Vyse! ¡Date prisa y dale una buena tunda a esos
Valuan para que pueda ir ahí abajo!\c"
MS14010011,\h(«Izmael»)¡Eso es! ¡A por ellos!\e
MS14010012,"\h(«Izmael»)¡No puedo creerlo! ¡A mi edad y sigo luchando!
¡Sólo intento ser como Brabham, pero no se le
digas.\c"
MS14010013,"\h(«Izmael»)Cuando conocí a Enrique, se pasaba el día en la
cubierta vomitando por la borda. ¡Ahora se ha
convertido en todo un marino!\e"
MS14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)¡Me impresiona que tenga el valor de volver a
Valua!\c"
MS14020000,"\h(«Belle»)Lo siento, Capitán…… Soy un poco torpe.
¡Antes también se me ha caído una bala de cañón
sobre el pie de alguien!\e"
MS14020001,"\h(«Belle»)¡Pero me estoy esforzando! ¡Dime qué debo hacer
y yo procuraré no meter la pata!\c"
MS14020002,"\h(«Belle»)¡Me quedé helada al ver que las Tierras de Hielo
son realmente de hielo! ¡De la sorpresa casi me
caigo por la borda!\e"
MS14020003,"\h(«Belle»)Al recuperar el equilibrio, me resbalé en el
hielo y me caí de culo. Aún tengo esa zona un
poco congelada.\c"
MS14020004,"\h(«Belle»)¡Al final, vamos a entrar por una zona
subterránea! ¡No sé cómo lo vamos a hacer, pero
yo excavaré tanto como pueda!\e"
MS14020005,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, ja, ja…… ¡No tienes que excavar!
Hay unas grietas en la tierra, entraremos por
allí.\e"
MS14020006,"\h(«Belle»)¿En serio? Je…… Oh…… Um…… Es bueno saberlo. Me
preguntaba cómo nos las íbamos a arreglar para
excavar a través de un continente……\c"
MS14020007,"\h(«Belle»)Capitán, creo que a Fina le pasa algo.
Es bastante reservada, pero no tanto.\e"
MS14020008,"\h(«Belle»)Espero que no sea porque la empapé cuando
tropecé con el cubo de agua.\c"
MS14020009,"\h(«Belle»)Estaba intentando hacer trucos de magia para que
Enrique se animara un poco, pero……\e"
MS14020010,"\h(«Belle»)…… se quedó ahí parado. Estaba deprimidísimo.
Por lo visto no doy una.\c"
MS14020011,"\h(«Belle»)Sé que Moegi lo ha estado pasando muy mal desde
que Enrique se marchó……\e"
MS14020012,"\h(«Belle»)…… No me puedo creer que ni siquiera llorara
cuando Enrique se fue del barco. Es tan
disciplinada. Ojalá yo fuera como ella.\c"
MS14020013,"\h(«Belle»)¡¿De dónde habrá salido esa isla?! ¡¿Cómo puede
una isla salir de la nada, así de repente?!\e"
MS14020014,"\h(«Belle»)¡Me quedé tan sorprendida que tropecé con unas
balas de cañón!
¡¿Por qué seré tan torpe?!\c"
MS14020015,"\h(«Belle»)¡Vamos a lanzar un ataque sobre la isla!
Sé que soy un pato y no hago más que complicar
las cosas, pero……\e"
MS14020016,"\h(«Belle»)¡He aprendido muchas cosas aquí en el Delphinus!
¡Creo que voy a hacerlo bien!\c"
MS14090000,"\h(«Lilly»)Las Tierras de Hielo…… suena tan romántico.
¿Me pregunto cómo serían los hombres que vivían
allí?\c"
MS14090001,"\h(«Lilly»)Me paso el día sacando brillo a los cañones……
¿Cómo voy a conocer chicos si siempre estoy
haciendo estas cosas?\c"
MS14090002,"\h(«Lilly»)Me han contado que encontraste todos los
Cristales Lunares. Todo el mundo dice que son
preciosos……\e"
MS14090003,"\h(«Lilly»)Eso es muy romántico…… Me gustan los hombres que
están dispuestos a arriesgarlo todo para
encontrar algo bonito para mí……\c"
MS14090004,\h(«Lilly»)¿Enrique vuelve a casa y Moegi no se va con él?\e
MS14090005,"\h(«Lilly»)Si yo fuera ella, nunca me alejaría del hombre
que amo.\c"
MS14090006,"\h(«Lilly»)¿Dónde queda exactamente el país de Fina?
¿Has conocido a su familia y todo eso?\e"
MS14090007,"\h(«Lilly»)Mmm…… Seguro que te pusiste nervioso cuando
fuiste, ¿eh, Vyse? Quiero decir…… Lo de Fina y
tú parece que va en serio…… ¿no?\c"
MS14090008,"\h(«Lilly»)Ese guapísimo Almirante, ¿va a quedarse en esa
isla que salió del Cielo Profundo?\e"
MS14090009,"\h(«Lilly»)Te lo juro…… cuanto más guapos, más raros.
¿Por qué no conoceré un chico normal?\c"
MS14090010,"\h(«Lilly»)¡Bueno, manos a la obra! Eh…… ¡Si yo fuera la
pirata que ayudó a salvar el mundo, ningún chico
se me resistiría!\e"
MS14090011,"\h(«Lilly»)¡Voy a esforzarme al máximo!
¡Sé que vamos a conseguirlo, Capitán Vyse!\c"
MS14090012,"\h(«Lilly»)¡¿Otra vez vamos al Cielo Profundo?!
¿No podemos quedarnos aquí?\e"
MS14090013,"\h(«Lilly»)Yo esperaba encontrar…… lugares más bonitos en
nuestras aventuras.\c"
MS14090014,"\h(«Lilly»)Enrique parece tan…… valiente, últimamente.
Eso le hace más atractivo.\c"
MS14100000,"\h(«Nara»)Aquí sentada…… puliendo las balas de cañón bajo
este bello cielo…… es tan relajante.\c"
MS14100001,"\h(«Nara»)Ese dragón seguro que era imponente.
¿Era uno de esos Gigas de los que siempre
habláis?\c"
MS14100002,"\h(«Nara»)¿Que te vas a colar en una base Valuan para
llevarte algo? Caray…… yo me pondría
nerviosísima……\c"
MS14100003,"\h(«Nara»)Enrique está muy raro últimamente……
¡Quizá debería invitarle a que nos ayudara a
pulir unas cuantas balas de cañón!\c"
MS14100004,"\h(«Nara»)¡Aunque él esté en Valua, y ella esté aquí,
los dos luchan por los mismos ideales!\e"
MS14100005,"\h(«Nara»)Es tan romántico……
¡Moegi, tienes que resistir! ¡Enrique te ama!\c"
MS14100006,"\h(«Nara»)Esa isla es tan siniestra…… Salir de entre las
nubes de esa forma……\e"
MS14100007,"\h(«Nara»)En mi opinión, deberíamos disparar un par de
veces a esa isla, por si acaso.\c"
MS14100008,\h(«Nara»)Por fin vamos a enfrentarnos a Ramírez……\e
MS14100009,"\h(«Nara»)Tenemos suficientes balas de cañón para
cualquier batalla. ¡Puedes disparar tantas veces
como quieras, Capitán Vyse!\c"
MSp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Esperanza……
No puedo creer que tengamos que ir al extremo
sur de Nasr…… eso está lejísimos.\e"
MSp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Bueno, sabía que esto no iba a ser fácil.
Supongo que salvar el mundo nunca lo es.\c"
MSp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Hace años, Valua envío aquí toda una flota para
atravesar la Gruta Oscura. Todos los navíos de
la flota fueron destruidos……\c"
MSp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Cuesta creer que acabamos de salir de la Gruta
Oscura. ¡Qué paisajes tan hermosos!\e"
MSp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)¡Enhorabuena, Vyse! Eres el primer capitán que
atraviesa con su navío la Gruta Oscura.\c"
MSp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)¡Nunca había visto un navío que se elevara de
esa forma!\e"
MSp0040010,\h(«Enrique»)Me pregunto qué tipo de motor usa……\c
MSp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Según la “Teoría del Mundo Esférico”, el mundo
es redondo, pero nadie ha podido demostrarlo.\e"
MSp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Si seguimos avanzando hacia el Este y vemos la
Isla de la Luna, podremos probar que
efectivamente, esa teoría es acertada.\c"
MSp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)La Armada Valuan ha enviado a muchos
investigadores a las Tierras de Hielo, pero……\e"
MSp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Nunca consiguieron atravesar el hielo, así que
nunca han podido explorar lo que hay por debajo.\c"
MSp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Ahora que tenemos el Cristal Púrpura, tendríamos
que regresar a la Isla de la Luna.
Pero me siento tan mal por Drachma……\e"
MSp0040016,\h(«Enrique»)El continente de Valua está lleno de cañones.\e
MSp0040017,"\h(«Enrique»)Doy por hecho que debajo de Valua también habrá
grietas y fisuras. Tiene que haber un camino que
nos conduzca a las Fauces de Tartas.\c"
MSp0040018,"\h(«Enrique»)Por fin hemos reunido todos los Cristales
Lunares.
Ahora volvamos a la Isla de la Luna.\c"
MSp0040019,\h(«Enrique»)Me pregunto qué planes tendrá Galcian……\c
MSp0040020,\h(«Enrique»)……\c
MSp0040021,"\h(«Enrique»)Un diseño que permite a los navíos llegar al
Cielo Profundo…… Me pregunto qué tramará la
Armada.\c"
MSp0040022,"\h(«Enrique»)Echaré de menos navegar contigo y con tu
tripulación. Odio admitirlo, pero hasta voy a
echar de menos las bromas de Aika.\c"
MSp0040023,"\h(«Enrique»)Bueno, volveré…… Y espero que sea pronto.\c"
MSp0040024,"\h(«Enrique»)¡Tenemos que detener a Ramírez! ¡Vyse, sé que
podemos hacerlo!\c"
MSp0040025,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, ¿puedo ir con vosotros a Soltis?\e"
MSp0040026,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decir?»)“Por supuesto.”
“Todo está bajo control.”\e"
MSp0040027,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Claro que puedes venir con nosotros!
De no ser por ti, jamás habríamos conseguido el
Delphinus. ¡Vamos allá!\e"
MSp0040028,"\h(«Enrique»)¡Gracias, Vyse!
¡Es un honor acompañarte!\e"
MSp0040029,\h( )Enrique se ha unido a tu grupo.\c
MSp0040030,"\h(«Enrique»)¡Bueno, si puedo serte de ayuda, sólo tienes que
decírmelo!\c"
MSf1000000,\h(«Polly»)Sé que mi marido está vivo…… en algún lugar……\c
MSf1000001,"\h(«Polly»)Debe haber sido duro, estar solo en un lugar tan
oscuro y atemorizante……\e"
MSf1000002,"\h(«Polly»)¡Me alegro tanto de haber venido contigo, Vyse!
¡Muchas gracias!\c"
MSf1000003,"\h(«Polly»)Saber que tenemos el continente de Valua
encima de nuestras cabezas no es muy
tranquilizador.\c"
MSf1000004,"\h(«Polly»)Esto es tan siniestro. Se nos va a estropear la
comida si seguimos más tiempo aquí abajo.\c"
MSf4090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Desde este lugar tan horrible no puedo oír la
voz de la Luna Roja. No podré leer tu destino
hasta que no estemos fuera de aquí.\c"
MSf5030000,"\h(«Merida»)Este sitio me da mucho miedo. Espero que podamos
irnos de aquí…… lo antes posible……\c"
MSf5030001,"\h(«Merida»)Odio a los Valuan. Quiero salir de aquí cuanto
antes.\c"
MSf5030002,"\h(«Merida»)Este sitio es de lo más desagradable…… Hay
muchas y diversas energías que convergen aquí.
El aire está muy cargado……\c"
MSf6310000,"\h(«Osman»)¡Salgamos de aquí inmediatamente!
¿Qué vas a hacer si chocamos contra algo?\c"
MSf6310001,"\h(«Osman»)Yo preferiría estar en un sitio algo más
animado. La gente no compra cuando está muerta
de miedo.\c"
MSf6310002,"\h(«Osman»)¡Este sitio me da escalofríos! ¡¿Cómo voy a
ganar dinero aquí abajo?!\c"
MSf6330000,"\h(«Khazim»)¡Muchachos! ¡Tenemos que trabajar duro para
derrocar a Valua!\e"
MSf6330001,"\h(«Los hombres de Khazim»)¡Sí, señor!\c"
MSf6330002,"\h(«Khazim»)Así que estamos volando dentro de Valua.
Me gustaría saber si se puede destruir Valua
desde su interior.\c"
MSf6330003,"\h(«Khazim»)¡Caray, este sitio es tenebroso! ¡Lo que más
odio en este mundo son los fantasmas y los
Pimientos Nasrian!\e"
MSf6330004,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)Sí, señor…… Khazhim, no debes comer Pimientos
Nasrian. Sirven para ahuyentar a los monstruos
del desierto.\c"
MSf6340000,\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¡Se pasa el día regañándonos!\c
MSf6340001,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)Nunca pensé que llegaría a ver el interior de
Valua, y la verdad, no me habría perdido nada.\c"
MSf6340002,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)¿No se supone que en el submundo debería haber
fantasmas?\c"
MSf6350000,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)Es tan extraño que Khazim no esté aquí echándome
la bronca. Pero me gusta.\c"
MSf6350001,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)Estar dentro de Valua no es la mejor manera de
pasar el rato.\c"
MSf6350002,"\h(«Artillero de Khazim»)A Khazim le dan mucho miedo los fantasmas.
Creo que cuando era pequeño le contaron muchas
historias macabras.\c"
MSf8030000,\h(«Urala»)Um…… Echo de menos contemplar el cielo……\e
MSf8030001,"\h(«Urala»)Antes me encantaba mirar por las ventanas del
navío, pero ahora no me atrevo ni a mirar lo que
hay fuera.\c"
MSf8030002,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… ¿Es cierto que ahí fuera viven horribles
monstruos?\e"
MSf8030003,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decirle?»)“Sí, es verdad.”
“No, no son más que habladurías.”\e"
MSf8030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí, es cierto. Hay todo tipo de horrendos seres
acechándote tras esa ventana.\e"
MSf8030005,"\h(«Urala»)Ahh…… um…… Vyse, no te vayas al puente de
mando…… No me dejes aquí sola……\c"
MSf8030006,"\h(«Vyse»)No, eso no son más que habladurías.
No te preocupes. No te va a pasar nada.\e"
MSf8030007,"\h(«Urala»)Gracias, Vyse, ahora me siento mejor…… No mucho
mejor…… sólo un poco. Sé que no me pasará nada,
pero tampoco me apetece quedarme aquí.\c"
MSf8030008,"\h(«Urala»)Hay montones de navíos hundidos ahí fuera.
Vyse, tengo mucho miedo.\c"
MSf8150000,"\h(«Kirala»)Así que Valua no es más que una roca gigantesca,
donde siempre hay tormentas y oscuridad……
Impresionante.\c"
MSf8150001,"\h(«Kirala»)Cuando era pequeña me encantaba hacer el ganso
por ahí, y mis padres siempre se enfadaban……\e"
MSf8150002,"\h(«Kirala»)Siempre me decían que me mandarían al Cielo
Profundo…… Y pensar que acabaría viniendo de
verdad……\c"
MSf8150003,"\h(«Kirala»)¡Los vientos de la Gruta Oscura son increíbles!
¡Ahora ya sé por qué los Occidentales nunca han
venido a Yafutoma!\c"
MSf4010000,"\h(«Izmael»)¡Bam Baka Bam! ¡Nunca imaginé que existieran
estas cavernas en Valua!\c"
MSf4010001,\h(«Izmael»)Qué miedo me da esto.\e
MSf4010002,"\h(«Izmael»)Es deprimente. Ya soy bastante viejo……
Y no quiero saber, al menos de momento, cómo es
el submundo.\c"
MSf4010003,"\h(«Izmael»)Los navegantes han intentado pasar al otro lado
de la Gruta Oscura desde que yo tenía tu edad.
¡Ja! ¡Hace ya mucho tiempo de eso!\c"
MSf4020000,"\h(«Belle»)¡No puedo creerlo! ¡Me he dejado todas las
golosinas en cubierta!\c"
MSf4020001,"\h(«Belle»)Capitán, creo que no hay fantasmas en el Cielo
Profundo.\e"
MSf4020002,"\h(«Belle»)¡Pero cuando empiezo a hablar de fantasmas,
vuelvo a tener mucho miedo! ¡Pues qué bien, yo
misma me meto miedo!\c"
MSf4020003,"\h(«Belle»)¡Anda, si me he dejado la ropa sucia secando en
cubierta!\e"
MSf4020004,"\h(«Belle»)Seguro que a estas alturas vuelve a estar sucia
por las corrientes de aire…… ¡Ya he vuelto a
meter la pata otra vez!\c"
MSf4f90000,"\h(«Lilly»)Me han dicho que hay zonas de Valua que son muy
bonitas, pero hasta esas partes son aburridas.\c"
MSf4f90001,"\h(«Lilly»)Vaya lugar tan deprimente.
No me gustan los sitios así.\e"
MSf4f90002,"\h(«Lilly»)Cuando nos vayamos de aquí, ¿podríamos ir a
Ixa'taka para probar la comida de la zona?\c"
MSf4f90003,"\h(«Lilly»)La Gruta Oscura da mucho miedo. Fíjate en la
cantidad de navíos que han naufragado aquí.
Tenemos que salir de aquí cuanto antes.\c"
MSf41f0000,\h(«Nara»)A mí la oscuridad me gusta. Es muy romántica.\c
MSf41f0001,"\h(«Nara»)Sigo esperando ver algún fantasma. Tengo mucho
miedo, pero cuando tengo miedo me lo paso muy
bien.\c"
MSf41f0002,"\h(«Nara»)Hay tantos aventureros que se han dejado el
pellejo en la Gruta Oscura…… Este sitio es de lo
más siniestro.\c"
MSf4030000,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Me pregunto cuánto mineral hay entre estos
muros. Y pensar en las armas que podría hacer.\c"
MSf4030001,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)El Cielo Profundo no es un lugar para los vivos.
No deberíamos estar aquí.\c"
MSf4030002,"\h(«Ryu-kan»)Si aprendes a meditar, hasta la peor tormenta te
parecerá una suave brisa.\c"
MSf4040000,"\h(«Robinson»)¡Nunca pensé que volvería a ver a Polly de
nuevo! ¡Soy tan feliz!\c"
MSf4040001,"\h(«Robinson»)Esta tenebrosa caverna es aún mejor que la Gruta
Oscura.\c"
MSf4040002,"\h(«Robinson»)¡De verdad que este sitio no me gusta nada!
Es peor que la Gruta Oscura.\e"
MSf4040003,"\h(«Robinson»)Si naufragara aquí, no sobreviviría ni un solo
día.\c"
MSf4040004,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Así que estamos en las Fauces de Tartas. Si los
geólogos que estudiaron conmigo se enteraran de
dónde estoy, se morirían de envidia.\c"
MSf4040005,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Este sitio es mucho más peligroso de lo que los
científicos han predicho. Hay muchísima energía
acumulada aquí……\c"
MSf4040006,"\h(«Ilchymis»)La leyenda habla de una Luna Negra que convivía
con el resto de las Lunas en el cielo.\e"
MSf4040007,"\h(«Ilchymis»)Es posible que esa Luna Negra sea la responsible
del inmenso poder y la presión que hay aquí
abajo……\c"
MSff030000,"\h(«Drachma»)¡No puedo quedarme de brazos cruzados mientras
Valua arrasa con todo! ¡Quiero ayudarte! Hemos
llegado hasta aquí juntos, ¿no es verdad?\c"
MSff030001,"\h(«Drachma»)¿Dices que vamos a ir a ese continente?
Chico, a veces no sé si es que te fallan las
entendederas.\e"
MSff030002,"\h(«Drachma»)Pero si insistes en que te acompañe, lo haré.\e"
MSff030003,"\h(«¿Qué quieres hacer?»)“Sí, me gustaría que vinieras con nosotros.”
“Es mejor que te quedes aquí por ahora.”\e"
MSff030004,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí, sería genial que vinieras con nosotros.
Podríamos usar ese viejo brazo tuyo para
partirle el cráneo a más de un enemigo.\e"
MSff030005,"\h(«Drachma»)Bueno…… supongo que tendré que ir contigo. Si me
hubiera imaginado que iba a estar luchando
contigo otra vez……\c"
MSff030006,\h( )Drachma se ha unido a tu grupo.\c
MSff030007,"\h(«Drachma»)¡Bah! Haz lo que quieras, muchacho.
Pero avísame si cambias de opinión……\c"
MSff050000,"\h(«Gilder»)¿Así que ahora vamos a atravesar la Gruta
Oscura? ¡Vyse, tú sí que sabes divertirte!
¡No hay quien se aburra en tu navío!\c"
MSff050001,"\h(«Gilder»)Recuerdo haber oído hablar de grietas bajo
Valua, pero no esperaba verlas en persona.\c"
MSff050002,"\h(«Gilder»)La idea de ir a explorar el Cielo Profundo me
resulta más atractiva que una taberna llena de
mujeres en Nasr.\c"
MSff050003,"\h(«Gilder»)Bueno, ha llegado el momento. Esta batalla
decidirá si seremos recordados como héroes o
como mártires. Prefiero que sea como héroes.\c"
MSff050004,"\h(«Gilder»)Oye, Vyse.
No estarás pensando en dejarme atrás, ¿verdad?
¡No voy a perderme toda la diversión!\e"
MSff050005,"\h(«¿Qué hacer?»)“¡Venga, Gilder! ¡Vamos!”
“Lo siento, pero tendrás que quedarte aquí.”\e"
MSff050006,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Venga, Gilder! ¡Vamos!\e"
MSff050007,"\h(«Gilder»)¡Eso es lo que quería oír!
¡Vamos a enseñarles de lo que somos capaces!\c"
MSff050008,\h( )Gilder se ha unido a tu grupo.\c
MSff050009,"\h(«Gilder»)¡Me rompes el corazón! Está bien, me quedo.
Si me necesitas, sólo tienes que decirlo.
Si Clara te pregunta, no sabes dónde estoy.\c"
MSii010000,"\h(«Aika»)¡Me encanta este sitio! ¡Tiene hasta cocina!
Creo que voy a acostumbrarme enseguida.\c"
MSi1000000,"\h(«Polly»)Teniendo en cuenta que está en el interior de un
barco, es una cocina impresionante.\e"
MSi1000001,"\h(«Polly»)Hay suficiente comida y utensilios para cocinar
mis mejores recetas.\c"
MSi6310000,"\h(«Osman»)Este navío me gusta mucho, es bello y fuerte……
más o menos como yo.\c"
MSi6310001,"\h(«Osman»)Si mi establecimiento no se hubiera quemado, te
habría prestado 100.000 piezas de oro……\e"
MSi6310002,"\h(«Osman»)El 20% de 100.000 piezas de oro…… esto…… Habría
obtenido sustanciosas ganancias.\c"
MS14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)Nunca pensé que viviría para ver el cielo azul
otra vez…… Casi había olvidado lo azul que es el
cielo.\e"
MS14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)Dejé atrás a Polly y a Anne para perseguir mis
sueños……\e"
MS14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)Naufragar en un lugar tan horrible…… perder la
memoria…… Estoy seguro de que las Lunas me
castigaron por abandonar a mi familia.\c"
MS14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)No puedo creer que llegara a olvidar a Polly
totalmente cuando sufrí amnesia.\e"
MS14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)Pero en el fondo sentía un gran vacío en mi
corazón. Lo que antes llenaba ese vacío, había
desaparecido.\c"
MS14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)Cuando estaba en Isla Los Marinos, Polly era lo
único que me mantenía en tierra. Ha sido lo
mejor que me ha pasado.\e"
MS14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)Y ahora que he recuperado la memoria, no volveré
a abandonarla. Preferiría morir.
Ahora sé cuánto significa Polly para mí……\c"
MS14040007,"\h(«Robinson»)¿Un navío que puede llegar hasta el Cielo
Profundo? Me recuerda a los días en que osé
desafiar la Gruta Oscura……\c"
MS14040008,"\h(«Robinson»)¡Quiero que ese Almirante Valuan que atacó la
Isla de la Luna pague por lo que hizo! ¡Polly
podría haber muerto durante el ataque!\e"
MS14040009,\h(«Robinson»)No puedo permitirme perder Polly de nuevo……\c
MS14040010,"\h(«Robinson»)Todo lo que significa algo para mí está en el
Océano Medio. Polly, Anne, mi taberna……\e"
MS14040011,"\h(«Robinson»)Esa isla apareció justo en el centro del Océano
Medio.
¡Tenemos que destruirla!\c"
MS14040012,"\h(«Robinson»)No puedo decir que sea tan fuerte como para
salvar el mundo. Tampoco pretendo ser un héroe.\e"
MS14040013,"\h(«Robinson»)Pero entregaré mi vida si es necesario para
proteger a Polly y a Anne…… y para proteger al
mundo en el que ellas viven……\c"
Ms034c000,"\h(«Vyse»)The Delphinus may be nice and all, but I really
miss a good sailboat…\c"
Ms034c001,"\h(«Vyse»)I miss sailing in a sailboat…
But hey! What am I doing?! This is no time to
sit here and look at paintings!\c"
Ms034c002,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like a picture of a bunch of merchant
ships lined up in a harbor. This was probably
painted by someone who really likes ships…\c"
Ms034c003,"\h(«Vyse»)This really is a nice picture…
But, I don't have time to sit here and admire
paintings! I've got to get going!\c"
Ms034c004,"\h(«Vyse»)Today's specials… Let me see…
Mid Ocean style sauteed fish…
And “The Spice of the Sky.”\c"
Ms034c005,"\h(«Vyse»)Today's specials… Let me see…
Yafutoman style simmered Kabal steak…
And Marocca marinade…\c"
Ms034c006,"\h(«Vyse»)Today's meals were prepared by… Aika?
Great… that just means dry cereal and pickled
vegetables…\c"
Ms034c007,"\h(«Vyse»)Today's dinner is…
Wait a second… I don't have time to be thinking
about food right now!\c"
Ms034c008,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow… There are all kinds of expensive goods
scattered across the table. Where does Osman
find all this stuff?\c"
Ms034c009,"\h(«Vyse»)Everything's a mess! I better hurry up and
fix the ship!\c"
MFs034c000,"\h(«Vyse»)Le Delphinus est peut-être beau mais un bon
voilier me manque……\c"
MFs034c001,"\h(«Vyse»)J'aimerais naviguer sur un voilier……
Mais, que fais-je…… ? Ce n'est pas le moment de
rêvasser et de regarder des tableaux !\c"
MFs034c002,"\h(«Vyse»)On dirait un tableau de navires marchands dans
un port. Cette peinture a dû être réalisée par
une personne qui aimait vraiment les navires……\c"
MFs034c003,"\h(«Vyse»)Ce tableau est magnifique……
Mais ce n'est pas le moment d'admirer des
tableaux. Il faut que j'y aille !\c"
MFs034c004,"\h(«Vyse»)La spécialité du jour…… Alors……
Du poisson sauté, style Océan Central……
Et “Les Épices du Ciel.”\c"
MFs034c005,"\h(«Vyse»)La spécialité du jour…… Alors……
Steak de Kabal à la Yafutomane……
Et une marinade de Marocca……\c"
MFs034c006,"\h(«Vyse»)Les plats d'aujourd'hui ont été préparés par……
Aika?
Génial…… ça veut dire que nous allons manger des
céréales et des légumes au vinaigre……\c"
MFs034c007,"\h(«Vyse»)Au menu du dîner aujourd'hui……
Un instant… Je n'ai pas le temps de penser à la
nourriture pour le moment !\c"
MFs034c008,"\h(«Vyse»)Oaouh…… Il y a tout type de marchandises chères
sur la table. Où est-ce qu'Osman trouve toute
cette nourriture ?\c"
MFs034c009,"\h(«Vyse»)Quel désordre ! J'ai tout intérêt à me dépêcher
de réparer le navire !\c"
MGs034c000,"\h(«Vyse»)Die Delphinus mag zwar toll sein
und alles, aber ich vermisse wirklich
ein Segelschiff……\c"
MGs034c001,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich vermisse ein Segelschiff……
Aber hey! Was mache ich?! Das ist nicht
die richtige Zeit, um hier rumzusitzen und
sich Bilder anzuschauen!\c"
MGs034c002,"\h(«Vyse»)Sieht aus wie ein Haufen Handelsschiffe,
die nebeneinander im Hafen liegen.
Das Bild hat wahrscheinlich jemand
gemalt, der Schiffe wirklich mag……\c"
MGs034c003,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist wirklich ein schönes Bild…… Aber ich
habe keine Zeit, hier rumzusitzen und Bilder zu
bewundern! Ich muss los!\c"
MGs034c004,"\h(«Vyse»)Im Angebot heute…… Lass mich mal
sehen…… Gebratener Fisch nach Mid Ocean
Art…… Und “Das Gewürz des Himmels.”\c"
MGs034c005,"\h(«Vyse»)Im Angebot heute…… Lass mich
mal sehen…… Gekochtes Kabal-Steak nach
yafutomanischer Art…… Und Marocca-Marinade……\c"
MGs034c006,"\h(«Vyse»)Das heutige Essen wurde von……
Aika gekocht? Großartig…… das bedeutet, es gibt
trockenes Müsli und eingelegtes Gemüse……\c"
MGs034c007,"\h(«Vyse»)Das heutige Abendessen ist……
Warte mal 'ne Sekunde…… habe momentan
gar keine Zeit, über Essen nachzudenken!\c"
MGs034c008,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow…… Da liegen alle möglichen teuren
Waren verstreut auf dem Tisch. Wo findet
Osman das ganze Zeug?\c"
MGs034c009,"\h(«Vyse»)Was für ein Durcheinander! Ich beeile mich
besser und repariere das Schiff!\c"
MSs034c000,"\h(«Vyse»)El Delphinus está muy bien,
pero yo echo mucho de menos
un buen navío de vela……\c"
MSs034c001,"\h(«Vyse»)Echo de menos navegar en un navío de vela……
Pero bueno, ¿qué estoy haciendo?
¡No es momento de sentarse a mirar fotos!\c"
MSs034c002,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece un cuadro de unos cuantos barcos
mercantes en un puerto. Seguramente quien lo
pintó disfrutaba con los navíos……\c"
MSs034c003,"\h(«Vyse»)Es un cuadro muy bonito, de verdad. ¡Pero no
tengo tiempo para sentarme y admirar cuadros!
¡Tengo que irme!\c"
MSs034c004,"\h(«Vyse»)Las especialidades del día. Déjame ver……
Pescado salado al estilo Océano Medio.
y “la Especia Celeste”.\c"
MSs034c005,"\h(«Vyse»)Las especialidades del día. Déjame ver……
Filete de Kabal guisado al estilo Yafutoma……
y Marocca marinado……\c"
MSs034c006,"\h(«Vyse»)¿La comida de hoy la ha preparado…… Aika?
Qué bien…… Eso significa que hay
cereales secos y verduras en conserva……\c"
MSs034c007,"\h(«Vyse»)La cena de hoy es……
Espera un momento…… ¡No tengo tiempo
de pensar en comida en este momento!\c"
MSs034c008,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Vaya! Hay toda clase de cosas caras
encima de la mesa.
¿Dónde encontrará Osman todas estas cosas?\c"
MSs034c009,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Está todo desordenado!
¡Será mejor que me dé prisa
y arregle el navío!\c"
