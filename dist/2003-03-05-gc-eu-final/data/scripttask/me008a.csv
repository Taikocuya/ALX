M04020001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell weapons.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M04020002,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Ten years ago, when my father was still with us 
and running this store, a war broke out with 
Valua.\e"
M04020003,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)To keep them from being destroyed in the war, my
father hid our merchandise and family treasures
in the city sewer system.\e"
M04020004,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)But the sewer system is a complicated maze. When
my father went back to retrieve our things after
the war… \e"
M04020005,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)…he could not remember where everything was 
hidden. After searching for weeks, he gave up.
I wonder if it is all still down there…\c"
M04020006,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)I think he hid all of it in two chests in the 
sewers, but we have not yet found them.\c"
M04020007,"\h(«Weapons Merchant»)Farewell! And may the Red Moon always watch over
you!\c"
M04030100,"\h(«Item Merchant»)Welcome welcome! Hey, I have heard of you!

M04030110,"\h(«Item Merchant»)Th, this is such an honor! …I get to talk to a

M04030001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Buy and sell items.”
“Talk about various things.”
“Leave.”\e"
M04030002,"\h(«Item Merchant»)Long ago, Valua and Nasr were locked in a 
terrible war. Since then, political relations 
between our two nations have been strained.\e"
M04030003,"\h(«Item Merchant»)However, trade hasn't been affected. Many
Merchants still travel to Valua and use Valuan
trade routes. So we have Valuan goods, too.\e"
M04030004,"\h(«Item Merchant»)Thank you, thank you. Yooooooowwch!! Farewell! \c"
M04040000,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Welcome to the Oasis of the Desert Inn! It is 
120 gold a night.\e"
M04040001,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M04040002,\h(«Innkeeper»)Thank you! Sleep well!\c
M04040003,\h(«Innkeeper»)Farewell. May the Red Moon be with you.\c
M04040011,"\h(«Innkeeper»)…Hm?
Hey, you do not have enough money! Come back 
when you do.\c"
M04040004,"\h(«Innkeeper»)When traveling in the desert, you must be very
careful not to push yourself too hard.
Please come again!\c"
M04040005,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Welcome!
Oh, yes, Bellena mentioned you would be coming.
Your room is ready.\e"
M04040006,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Stay the night.”
“Leave.”\e"
M04040007,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Hah hah hah. Ever since Bellena started dancing 
in Maramba, more and more tourists have been 
coming and business has increased three-fold!\e"
M04040008,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Since you are a friend of Bellena's, I will give
you a special rate on your room. Sleep well.\c"
M04040009,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Farewell and may the Red Moon forever light your
path!\c"
M04040010,"\h(«Innkeeper»)Well, we have plenty of vacancies, in case you
change your mind. Please come again.\c"
M04050000,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Hail, sailor. You wish to see the new dancer, 
too?\e"
M04050001,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Bellena's dancing is Maramba's newest star
attraction. You definitely don't want to leave
without seeing her. \c"
M04050002,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)You're lucky… Tonight's the first quiet night 
here since Bellena started. It's usually packed.\e"
M04050003,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)She's some traveling dancer who started here two
or three days ago. But what a piece of luck
she's been for this old tavern!\c"
M04050004,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)This is Bellena's day off. Oh yeah, she left a 
message for you. She wishes you to meet her at 
the port.\e"
M04050005,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)What's your secret? Until now Bellena had 
spurned every invitation she received. Well, 
whatever it is…\c"
M04050006,\h(«Tavernkeep»)Bellena has the day off today.\c
M04050007,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)If you're looking for Bellena, she quit. I still
can't believe she left, though… She used to
bring in so many customers…\e"
M04050008,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)She did leave a message, though. “I decided that
finding out how vast the desert is will have to
wait for another time, handsome.”\e"
M04050009,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)“A sailor must be prepared for any situation. 
But, I underestimated you. I will not a second 
time. Farewell for now… we shall meet again.”\e"
M04050010,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)Well, that's all she wrote. I couldn't figure it
out. Do you know what she meant?\c"
M04050011,"\h(«Tavernkeep»)If you're looking for Bellena, she hasn't been 
by since she quit. You think she'd at least say 
hi every once in a while…\c"
M04060000,"\h(«Dancer»)Well, hello, handsome. I don't think I've seen 
you around here before.\e"
M04060001,"\h(«Dancer»)If you've come to rest your weary feet, you've
come to the right place. Make yourself
comfortable and stay awhile.\e"
M04060002,"\h(«What shall I do?»)“That sounds like a great idea!”
“Actually, I'm a little busy right now…”\e"
M04060003,"\h(«Vyse»)That actually sounds like a great idea!
It's been a while since we've had time to
relax…\e"
M04060004,"\h(«Dancer»)Please stay!
Stay as long as you like! Sit down, sit down.\e"
M04060005,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, we're in a bit of a rush…
I don't think we have time to relax here.\e"
M04060006,"\h(«Dancer»)You know, handsome, here in the desert, we say
that you should always drink water whenever you
can.\e"
M04060007,"\h(«Dancer»)It's important to rest now and then when you're 
traveling. Come on. Stop rushing around and sit 
down, sit down.\c"
M04060008,"\h(«Bellena»)Please stay at the local inn tonight.
I know the owner and she'll give you a
discount…\e"
M04060009,"\h(«Bellena»)Desert travel is not easy. You'll need to get a
good night's sleep first. Meet me at the port
in the morning.\e"
M04070000,"\h(«Love-sick Man»)Those slender legs… that soft, smooth skin…
that silky, red hair… she's poetry in motion…\e"
M04070001,"\h(«Love-sick Man»)The first time I saw her, I knew it was love. I
have come every day just to watch her dance…\c"
M04070002,"\h(«Love-sick Man»)Why does her dancing haunt me like this? I wish
she would just talk to me…\c"
M04070003,\h(«Love-sick Man»)Oh no… You mean I won't get to see her today?\c
M04070004,"\h(«Love-sick Man»)I have even seen her dancing in my dreams
lately…\e"
M04070005,"\h(«Love-sick Man»)I… I just cannot forget her! I do not know what
to do…\c"
M04080000,\h(«Rowdy Sailor»)Hey Bellena! Over here!\e
M04080001,"\h(«Rowdy Sailor»)Hey! Blow off! Can't you see I'm tryin' to watch
the show here?! What? You need a ship?\e"
M04080002,"\h(«Rowdy Sailor»)Heh, sorry kid, but I got plans of my own. See 
that Bellena over there? I'm gonna ask her to 
sail with me tonight. Go find a different ship.\c"
M04080003,"\h(«Rowdy Sailor»)Hur hur hur… Who woulda thought there'd be a 
beautiful girl like her out here in the desert? 
I'm glad I came to Maramba tonight…\c"
M04080004,"\h(«Rowdy Sailor»)Hey Bellena! C'mon out already! We're all 
waitin' for you!\e"
M04080005,"\h(«Rowdy Sailor»)Don't you just hate it how all the pretty women
always play hard to get? Or… maybe it's just
with me… Hm…\c"
M04080006,"\h(«Rowdy Sailor»)If you're wonderin' why I'm still here even 
though Bellena doesn't work here anymore…\e"
M04080007,"\h(«Rowdy Sailor»)…it's 'cuz I've never seen a woman quite like 
her before. And believe me… I've been lookin' 
for a very looooong time.\c"
M04090000,"\h(«Fortune Teller»)Welcome! I am Kalifa, Seer of the Red Moon. I am
the most renowned fortuneteller in all of Nasr.\e"
M04090001,"\h(«Kalifa»)Travelers from across the skies come to me
seeking the knowledge and wisdom of the Moons…\e"
M04090002,"\h(«Kalifa»)There is no future I do not know… no path I 
cannot see. Hark my words and heed them in your 
journey.\e"
M04090003,"\h(«Kalifa»)Welcome. Hear my words and heed them in your
journey.\e"
M04090004,"\h(«Kalifa»)Welcome… hm? You! I have seen your face in my 
dreams…\e"
M04090005,"\h(«Kalifa»)It was a dream in which someone holding a 
“Suiran Blade” beckons me into the sky…\e"
M04090006,"\h(«Kalifa»)Perhaps it was nothing… Do you wish to know of 
your fate?\e"
M04090007,"\h(«Should I have my fortune told?»)“Have my fortune told.”
“Not today.”\e"
M04090008,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm…\e
M04090009,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaa!!!\e
M04090010,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken! To the east of here 
lies a temple in which a sacred red jewel lies 
buried in the hot sands!\c"
M04090011,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken! Where the great winds 
blow is where you will Discover the island with 
a bird's beak!\c"
M04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken! Amidst the dark winds, 
there lives a man stranded for many years!\c"
M04090013,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken! Far above the city of 
Nasrad, there is a man-made star!\c"
M04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)Go forth, and seek your fate. And may the Red 
Moon watch over you…\c"
M04090015,"\h(«Kalifa»)I see. If ever you need the guidance of the Red
Moon, do not hesitate to return. I pray for your
safety in your travels…\c"
M04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)Welcome… hm? You! I have seen your face in my 
dreams…\e"
M04090017,"\h(«Kalifa»)It was a dream in which someone holding a 
“Suiran Blade” beckons me into the sky…\e"
M04090018,\h(«Vyse»)A Suiran Blade? I've got one right here…\e
M04090019,"\h(«Kalifa»)What?! Then perhaps it was you who came to me
in my dreams… It appears that the Red Moon has
decided my fate.\e"
M04090020,"\h(«Kalifa»)I cannot go against the will of the Moon.
I am henceforth at your service.\e"
M04090021,"\h(«Kalifa»)I am Kalifa, Seer of the Red Moon. I am the most
renowned fortuneteller in all of Nasr. There is
no future that I cannot see.\e"
M04090022,\h( )Kalifa has joined you as a “Merchant.”\c
M04100000,\h(«Dhabu»)Grrfa!\e
M04110000,"\h(«Trainer»)Welcome my friend! Are you planning on crossing 
to the other part of the city? Perhaps you wish 
to ride a Dhabu?\e"
M04110001,"\h(«Trainer»)The sands of the desert are too hot to walk
upon. It's best to take a Dhabu.\e"
M04110002,"\h(«Will you take a Dhabu?»)“Sure, I'll take one.”
“No thanks.”\e"
M04110003,"\h(«Trainer»)Dhabu stands are marked with red poles. You
can dismount from your Dhabu wherever you see
those red poles.\c"
M04110004,"\h(«Trainer»)Alright, but I've warned you… You'll burn your 
feet on the scorching sands if you don't take a 
Dhabu, so I cannot let you outside the fence.\c"
M04120006,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)You are a sailor, are you not? I could tell by 
your smell. Hmph… You sailors are nothing but 
trouble.\e"
M04120007,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)I had a daughter, but she fell in love with this
sailor who drifted into town one day.\e"
M04120008,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)The next thing I knew she ran off with this 
good-for-nothing sailor and left me here to run 
this shop by myself.\e"
M04120009,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)I have not heard from her since. Hrumph. She's 
probably lying dead in a gutter somewhere by 
now.\c"
M04120010,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)I never thought she'd grow up to be the kind of 
girl that would abandon her parents to elope 
with a sailor. Stupid girl.\c"
M04120011,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)I remember you. You were that sailor that came 
in here a little while ago. What is your wish?\e"
M04120012,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)What?! M, my daughter? She's still alive?!\e"
M04120014,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)…Well, good for her. Not that it means anything
to me anymore. She does not expect me to forgive
her and take her back now, does she?\e"
M04120015,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)Hrumph! She's a stupid girl. She is my daughter 
no more. Leave my shop!\c"
M04120016,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)Hrumph! She's a stupid girl. She is my daughter 
no more. Leave my shop!\c"
M04120017,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)You are persistent, I will give you that. What 
is it this time? What? You wish me to taste 
something?\e"
M04120018,\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)But it's… it's a Kabal Skewer!\e
M04120019,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)What? You're telling me that that
good-for-nothing girl who ran away from home
made this Kabal Skewer?\e"
M04120020,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)Y, you expect me to believe that? Hah! Well,
let's at least see what it tastes like.\e"
M04120005,\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)…\e
M04120021,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)No, it's nothing like the Kabal Skewer I make.
The person who made this can't be my daughter…
I taught her better than this…\e"
M04120022,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)It has an odd smell, the seasonings are bland, 
and worst of all, the meat just is not of the 
same quality.\c"
M04120023,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)That Kabal Skewer has an odd smell, the
seasonings are bland, and worst of all, the meat
just isn't of the same quality.\c"
M04120024,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)You're back?! I said you were persistent, but 
this is ridiculous… What? You wish me to taste 
ANOTHER Kabal Skewer?\e"
M04120002,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)Alright, alright… I give in. Let me taste it.\e"
M04120000,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)I, I can't believe it. Th, this tastes exactly
like my Kabal Skewer!\e"
M04120025,"\h(«Aika»)Your daughter says she never once forgot about
the times she spent with you… and she hasn't
forgotten anything you've ever taught her.\e"
M04120026,"\h(«Aika»)And the proof is in that Kabal Skewer. She tried
so hard to make it just like yours. Please…
she's begging for your forgiveness…\e"
M04120003,\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)…\e
M04120027,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)…Tell her that it'll taste even better if she
leaves it on the fire for another 30 seconds.\e"
M04120001,"\h(«Aika»)Huh? What do you mean by that? Are you forgiving
her?\e"
M04120004,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)Yes, you've won me over. I didn't think I could 
ever forgive her, but perhaps I was wrong. 
Perhaps I was at fault, as well…\c"
M04120028,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)You won me over. I didn't think I could ever
forgive her, but perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps I
was at fault somewhere, as well…\c"
M04120029,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)Welcome, sailor. Thank you for all that you have
done for my daughter… and for me…\e"
M04120030,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)That foolish daughter of mine says she's going 
to start making Kabal Skewers for her tavern in
Esparanza.\e"
M04120031,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)So if you're ever in Esparanza, stop by for one 
of my daughter's Kabal Skewers.\c"
M04120032,"\h(«Kabal Skewer Lady»)So if you're ever in Esparanza, stop by for one 
of my daughter's Kabal Skewers.\c"
M04130000,\h(«Dhabu»)Grrfa!\e
M04140000,"\h(«Trader»)Welcome, travelers, to the beautiful and
ever-warm lands of Nasr!\e"
M04140001,"\h(«Trader»)Enjoy Maramba, the oasis of the desert. And fear
not while you are here, the Red Moon watches
over us all in the lands of Nasr!\e"
M04140002,\h(«Vyse»)Thanks. I feel welcome already.\e
M04140003,"\h(«Trader»)The warmth of the Moon warms our hearts here in
Nasr. I wish only to share with you that which
I have been blessed with myself.\e"
M04140004,"\h(«Trader»)Welcome, travelers, to the beautiful and
ever-warm lands of Nasr!\e"
M04140005,"\h(«Trader»)Hello there! Perhaps you've heard of this news
already, but I recently spoke with a merchant
from Valua and he told me something interesting.\e"
M04140006,"\h(«Trader»)Apparently there's a vast green continent beyond
the South Ocean that's covered by a deep forest.\e"
M04140007,"\h(«Trader»)Of course, there've long been rumors about such
a place. Sailors have spoken of strange leaves
that are carried in the winds from the south…\e"
M04140008,"\h(«Trader»)Apparently there's a vast green continent beyond
the South Ocean that's covered by a deep 
forest.\c"
M04140009,"\h(«Trader»)Hello there! You seem well-traveled enough to
know this, but I have heard rumors of a land
covered completely in ice south of South Ocean.\e"
M04140010,"\h(«Trader»)Here in Nasr, we almost never see ice at all.
It's hard to imagine an entire continent covered
in ice.\e"
M04140011,"\h(«Trader»)Just think of the money you could make if you
could bring all that ice back to Nasr!\e"
M04140012,"\h(«Trader»)I have heard rumors of a land covered completely
in ice south of South Ocean.\e"
M04140013,"\h(«Trader»)Recently, there's been an increase in trade 
caravans to Esparanza.\e"
M04140014,"\h(«Trader»)In fact, not so long ago, I made the trip
myself, and I was surprised at how lively the
market there was.\e"
M04140015,"\h(«Trader»)They need much material to rebuild their city, 
so I think they'll make great trading partners.\e"
M04140016,"\h(«Trader»)Come to think of it, a young lady I saw in a
tavern there said she was born in this city.\c"
M04140017,"\h(«Trader»)Come to think of it, a young lady I saw in a
tavern there said she was born in this city.\c"
M04140018,"\h(«Trader»)Hello! I noticed that there haven't been any 
trade ships from Valua coming here in a while. 
Did something happen?\e"
M04140019,"\h(«Trader»)What?! Valua was destroyed by the Rains of 
Destruction? Is it really so? I always thought 
of the Rains of Destruction as legend.\c"
M04140020,"\h(«Trader»)Is it true that the Rains of Destruction fell 
upon Valua?\c"
M04150000,"\h(«Young Maiden»)In the desert, water is life. That is why we
must carry water every day from the well.\e"
M04150001,"\h(«Young Maiden»)There is a well in the other part of the city,
but it has been dry for a long time now.\c"

MG04040011,"\h(«Gastwirtin»)……Hm?
Heh, Sie haben nicht genug Geld! Kommen Sie
wieder, wenn Sie welches haben.\c"
MG04040004,"\h(«Gastwirtin»)Wenn man durch die Wüste reist, muss man
aufpassen, dass man sich nicht übernimmt.
Auf Wiedersehen!\c"
MG04040005,"\h(«Gastwirtin»)Willkommen!
O ja, Bellena hat so etwas erwähnt, dass Sie
kommen würden. Ihr Zimmer ist fertig.\e"
MG04040006,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Übernachten”.
“Weggehen”.\e"
MG04040007,"\h(«Gastwirtin»)Hahahaha. Seitdem Bellena in Maramba tanzt,
kommen immer mehr Touristen angereist, und
das Geschäft ist auf das Dreifache
angestiegen!\e"
MG04040008,"\h(«Gastwirtin»)Da du ein Freund von Bellena bist, mach ich
dir einen Sonderpreis für das Zimmer.
Schlaf gut.\c"

deinen Weg beleuchten!\c"
MG04040010,"\h(«Gastwirtin»)Nun, wir haben viele Zimmer frei, falls Sie
sich anders entscheiden sollten.
Auf Wiedersehen.\c"
MG04050000,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Zum Gruß, Matrose! Möchten Sie auch die neue
Tänzerin sehen?\e"
MG04050001,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Bellenas Tanzdarbietung ist die jüngste
Hauptattraktion von Maramba. Sie sollten auf
keinen Fall abreisen, ohne sie gesehen zu
haben.\c"
MG04050002,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Sie haben Glück…… heute ist der erste ruhigere
Abend, seit Bellena angefangen hat.
Normalerweise ist es proppenvoll.\e"
MG04050003,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Sie ist eine reisende Künstlerin, die vor
zwei oder drei Tagen hier angefangen hat.
Sie hat sich für diese Taverne als wahrer
Segen erwiesen!\c"
MG04050004,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Heute hat Bellena frei. Ach ja, sie hat eine
Nachricht für Sie hinterlassen. Sie möchte,
dass Sie sie am Hafen treffen.\e"
MG04050005,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Wie machen Sie das bloß? Bis jetzt hat
Bellena alle Einladungen abgelehnt. Tja,
was immer es auch sein mag……\c"
MG04050006,\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Bellena hat heute frei.\c
MG04050007,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Wenn Sie Bellena suchen, sie hat aufgehört.
Ich kann noch immer nicht fassen, dass sie
gegangen ist…… Mit ihr hat das Geschäft so
floriert……\e"
MG04050008,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Sie hat jedoch eine Nachricht hinterlassen.
“Ich werde den Versuch, herauszufinden, wie
groß die Wüste ist, auf später verschieben,
Süßer”.\e"
MG04050009,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)“Ein Seefahrer muss auf alles gefasst sein.
Aber ich habe dich unterschätzt. Ein zweites
Mal passiert mir das nicht. Für heute lebe
wohl…… wir werden uns wieder sehen”.\e"
MG04050010,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Nun, das ist alles, was sie geschrieben hat.
Ich konnte mir darauf keinen Reim machen.
Wissen Sie, was es zu bedeuten hat?\c"
MG04050011,"\h(«Taverneninhaber»)Wenn Sie nach Bellena Ausschau halten, sie
ist nicht mehr aufgetaucht, seit sie gegangen
ist. Man würde doch annehmen, dass sie
zumindest ab und an mal hereinschaut……\c"
MG04060000,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Ach hallo, schöner Mann. Ich glaube, dich
hab ich hier noch nie gesehen.\e"
MG04060001,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Wenn du gekommen bist, um deine müden Knochen
auszuruhen, bist du am richtigen Ort. Mach
es dir bequem und bleib ein Weilchen.\e"

entspannen konnten……\e"

Bleibt so lange, wie ihr wollt!
Setzt euch doch.\e"
MG04060005,"\h(«Vyse»)Eigentlich sind wir ziemlich in Eile……
Ich glaube nicht, dass wir uns hier
aufhalten können.\e"
MG04060006,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Weißt du, schöner Mann, hier in der Wüste gibt
es den Spruch, man solle Wasser trinken,
wann immer man kann.\e"
MG04060007,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Wenn man so viel unterwegs ist, ist es
wichtig, dass man sich ab und zu erholt.
Kommt schon.
Hört auf, herumzuhasten und setzt euch hin.\c"
MG04060008,"\h(«Bellena»)Bitte übernachtet doch heute im Gasthaus hier
am Ort. Ich kenne die Eigentümerin, und sie
wird euch einen Preisnachlass geben……\e"
MG04060009,"\h(«Bellena»)Eine Reise durch die Wüste ist beschwerlich.
Zuerst müsst ihr euch mal richtig ausschlafen.
Trefft mich morgen früh am Hafen.\e"
MG04070000,"\h(«Liebeskranker Mann»)Diese schlanken Beine…… diese weiche, glatte
Haut…… dieses seidige, rote Haar…… sie ist
einfach ein Gedicht……\e"
MG04070001,"\h(«Liebeskranker Mann»)Das erste Mal, als ich sie sah, wusste ich,
dass es Liebe war. Ich bin jeden Tag hier,
nur, um sie tanzen zu sehen……\c"
MG04070002,"\h(«Liebeskranker Mann»)Warum geht mir ihr Tanz einfach nicht aus dem
Kopf? Wenn sie wenigstens mit mir sprechen
würde……\c"
MG04070003,"\h(«Liebeskranker Mann»)O nein…… Wollen Sie damit sagen, dass ich
sie heute nicht sehen kann?\c"
MG04070004,"\h(«Liebeskranker Mann»)Ich sehe sie neuerdings sogar in meinen
Träumen tanzen……\e"
MG04070005,"\h(«Liebeskranker Mann»)Ich…… ich kann sie einfach nicht vergessen!
Was soll ich bloß machen……\c"
MG04080000,"\h(«Ungehobelter Matrose»)Heh, Bellena! Hier rüber!\e"
MG04080001,"\h(«Ungehobelter Matrose»)Heh! Zieh Leine! Siehst du nicht, dass ich
die Show sehen will?! Was? Du brauchst ein
Schiff?\e"
MG04080002,"\h(«Ungehobelter Matrose»)Also, tut mir Leid, Kid, aber ich habe selber
Pläne. Siehst du diese Bellena dort drüben?
Ich werde sie fragen, ob sie heute Abend mit
mir mitkommen will. Such ein anderes Schiff.\c"
MG04080003,"\h(«Ungehobelter Matrose»)Hachacha…… wer hätte gedacht, dass es hier in
der Wüste so ein hübsches Mädchen wie sie
gibt? Ich bin vielleicht froh, dass ich heute
Abend nach Maramba gekommen bin……\c"
MG04080004,"\h(«Ungehobelter Matrose»)Heh, Bellena! Na komm schon! Wir warten alle
auf dich!\e"
MG04080005,"\h(«Ungehobelter Matrose»)Ist das nicht zum Ausrasten, wie sich alle
schönen Frauen immer so zieren müssen?
Oder…… vielleicht ist sie nur so bei mir…… Hm……\c"
MG04080006,"\h(«Ungehobelter Matrose»)Wenn ihr euch fragt, warum ich noch immer
hier herumhänge, wo Bellena gar nicht mehr
hier arbeitet……\e"
MG04080007,"\h(«Ungehobelter Matrose»)……weil ich noch nie eine Frau wie sie
gesehen habe. Und ihr könnt mir glauben……
ich seh mich schon eine ganze Weile um.\c"
MG04090000,"\h(«Wahrsagerin»)Willkommen! Ich bin Kalifa, Hellseherin
des Roten Mondes. Ich bin die berühmteste
Wahrsagerin in ganz Nasr.\e"

MG04090004,"\h(«Kalifa»)Willkommen…… hm? Du bist's! Ich habe dein
Gesicht in meinen Träumen gesehen……\e"
MG04090005,"\h(«Kalifa»)Es war ein Traum, in dem mich jemand, der eine

MG04090009,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaa!!!\e
MG04090010,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Rote Mond hat gesprochen! Östlich von hier

Juwel im heißen Sand vergraben liegt!\c"
MG04090011,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Rote Mond hat gesprochen! Wo die starken
Winde wehen, dort wirst du die Insel mit dem
Vogelschnabel entdecken!\c"
MG04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Rote Mond hat gesprochen! Inmitten der
dunklen Winde lebt ein Mann seit vielen
Jahren für sich allein!\c"
MG04090013,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Rote Mond hat gesprochen! Hoch über der
Stadt Nasrad gibt es einen Stern, von

MG04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)Geh deiner Wege und folge deinem Schicksal.
Und möge dich der Rote Mond beschützen……\c"

MG04090019,"\h(«Kalifa»)Was?! Dann warst du es vielleicht, der mir
im Traum erschienen ist…… Es scheint, dass
der Rote Mond mein Schicksal entschieden hat.\e"

handeln. Ich stehe dir von nun an zu Diensten.\e"

MG04110000,"\h(«Dhabu-Treiber»)Willkommen, mein Freund! Haben Sie vor, zur
anderen Seite der Stadt zu gehen? Vielleicht
möchten Sie ein Dhabu nehmen?\e"
MG04110001,"\h(«Dhabu-Treiber»)Der Sand der Wüste ist zu heiß, um darauf zu
laufen. Es ist am besten, man nimmt ein Dhabu.\e"
MG04110002,"\h(«Wirst du ein Dhabu nehmen?»)“Klar, ich nehme eines”.
“Nein, danke”.\e"
MG04110003,"\h(«Dhabu-Treiber»)Dhabu-Stände sind mit roten Pfählen markiert.
Sie können jederzeit von Ihrem Dhabu absteigen,
wenn Sie die Pfähle sehen.\c"
MG04110004,"\h(«Dhabu-Treiber»)Also gut, ich habe Sie gewarnt…… Sie werden
sich auf dem glühenden Sand die Füße
verbrennen, wenn Sie kein Dhabu nehmen,
also kann ich Sie nicht durch den Zaun lassen.\c"
MG04120006,"\h(«Kabal-Spieß-Verkäuferin»)Du bist Matrose, nicht? Das merkt man am
Geruch. Hmpf…… ihr Seeleute bringt nichts
als Ärger.\e"
MG04120007,"\h(«Kabal-Spieß-Verkäuferin»)Ich hatte eine Tochter, aber die hat sich in
diesen Matrosen verliebt, den es irgendwann
mal in die Stadt verschlagen hat.\e"

lausigen Matrosen davongelaufen und hat mich
hier im Laden allein gelassen.\e"

Hrumpf. Wahrscheinlich liegt sie irgendwo
tot im Graben.\c"
MG04120010,"\h(«Kabal-Spieß-Verkäuferin»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass sie es je wagen
würde, ihre Eltern im Stich zu lassen, um mit

MG04120014,"\h(«Kabal-Spieß-Verkäuferin»)……Tja, gut für sie. Nicht, dass es mir noch

hat, ist auf keinen Fall meine Tochter……

Lass mal probieren.\e"

Zeit mit Ihnen keine Minute lang vergessen hat……
und sie hat auch nichts von dem vergessen,
was Sie ihr beigebracht haben.\e"

ihr zu verzeihen?\e"
MG04120004,"\h(«Kabal-Spieß-Verkäuferin»)Ja, du hast mich überzeugt. Ich dachte nicht,

MGs008a021,"\h(«Vyse»)Geräuchertes Kabalfleisch…… Es riecht, als
sei es mit Khale gewürzt. Es sieht ziemlich
scharf aus, mir läuft trotzdem das Wasser
im Mund zusammen.\c"
MGs008a022,"\h(«Vyse»)Uhh! Was ist das für ein Geruch?!
Ich habe noch nie etwas so Strenges gerochen……\c"
MGs008a023,"\h(«Vyse»)Igitt! Etwas hat sich darin bewegt. Erzähl
mir nicht, dass das Essen ist……
Ich tue einfach so, als hätte ich nichts
gesehen.\c"
MGs008a024,"\h(«Vyse»)Es enthält eine sehr seltsame, schleimige,
rosa Flüssigkeit. Ich frage mich,
wofür die ist?\c"
MGs008a025,"\h(«Vyse»)Da brennt so etwas wie Weihrauch.
Der süßliche Geruch in der Luft ist so
stark, dass ich fast ersticke.\c"
MSs008a000,"\h(«Vyse»)Es un pozo. Debe de ser difícil encontrar un
lugar donde excavar un pozo por aquí.
Por eso, la ciudad puede soportar este clima.\c"
MSs008a001,"\h(«Vyse»)Es un jarro. Me imagino que será para sacar
agua del pozo. Parece completamente seco……
Con este calor se secará muy rápido.\c"
MSs008a002,"\h(«Vyse»)Es una puerta muy pesada……
Creo que no voy a poder mover esto yo solo……\c"
MSs008a003,"\h(«Vyse»)Ésta debe de ser una estación de alimentación
para Dhabu. ¡¿Pero qué les darán de comer?!
¡¡Apesta por aquí!!\c"
MSs008a004,"\h( )“Parada de Dhabu”
Por favor, llama al adiestrador.\c"
MSs008a005,"\h(«Vyse»)Son como unas ruinas……
¿Qué es esto?
Hay una escalera, que viene de abajo.\c"
MSs008a006,\h(«Vyse»)“Informe del Club de Conductores de Dhabu”\e
MSs008a007,"\h(«Vyse»)“A los Dhabus les gusta estar limpios.
Después de un largo viaje,
permíteles que se bañen en el agua.”\c"

¡No puedo pasar!\c"
MSs008a013,\h( )｡Has recibido ????!\c
MSs008a014,"\h(«Vyse»)Arpones, flechas, porras…… Toda clase de armas.
Pero, a decir verdad, donde esté una espada, que
se quite lo demás.\c"
MSs008a015,"\h(«Vyse»)Están usando bastantes Piedras Rojas para
crear esas llamaradas intensas. Quizás ése sea
el secreto para quemarlas bien.\e"
MSs008a016,"\h(«Vyse»)Ah, especias. No sé bien de dónde viene el
olor, pero es muy fuerte, y al mismo tiempo,
dulce……\c"

MSs008a018,"\h(«Vyse»)Es una puerta muy pesada……
Creo que no voy a poder mover esto yo solo……\c"
MSs008a019,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay un poco de Relik Loqua aquí.
Me imagino que a la gente de por aquí le gusta
su loqua picante.\c"
MSs008a020,"\h(«Vyse»)Está lleno de loqua. ¡Qué asco! ¡Hay una especie
de bicho en la botella! Sólo de pensar en
probarlo ya me pongo malo……\c"
MSs008a021,"\h(«Vyse»)Carne de Kabal ahumada…… Huele como si estuviera
sazonada con Khale. Estará muy picante, pero se
me ha hecho la boca agua.\c"
MSs008a022,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Uff! ¡¿A qué huele?!
Nunca antes había olido algo tan fuerte……\c"
MSs008a023,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Qué asco! Vi algo moviéndose dentro. No, no me
digas que es comida…… Creo que haré como que no
he visto nada.\c"
MSs008a024,"\h(«Vyse»)Contiene un líquido con una pinta extraña, como
rosado. ¿Para qué será?\c"
MSs008a025,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay incienso quemándose. La esencia dulce en el
aire es tan densa que casi me está afixiando.\c"
MD0030000,"\h(«Dancer»)Why, hello there, handsome.
I've never seen you around here before.\e"
MD0030001,"\h(«Dancer»)You must be tired.
Sit down and stay a while.\e"
MD0030002,"\h(«What will you say?»)“Sure!”
“We're a little busy right now…”\e"
MD0030003,"\h(«Vyse»)Sure!
I suppose we could use some rest.\e"
MD0030004,"\h(«Dancer»)Great! Sit back and enjoy the show. 
I hope you like what you see.\e"
MD0030005,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…
We're a little busy right now…\e"
MD0030006,"\h(«Dancer»)There is a saying here in Maramba,
“Drink water whenever you get the chance.”\e"
MD0030007,"\h(«Dancer»)You never know whenever you'll get another
chance to relax.
I suggest that you take it easy while you can.\e"
MD0030008,"\h(«Aika»)Oh…
In Nasr, I guess they just sit on the ground. \e"
MD0030009,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah, it feels good to finally sit down.\e"
MD0030010,"\h(«Aika»)Well, we shouldn't rest too long, we gotta go
look for a ship. I wonder where we can find one.
Maybe we should try the docks.\e"
MD0030011,"\h(«Aika»)I can't believe that Cap'n Drachma just left us
here…\e"
MD0030012,"\h(«Aika»)I'm sure he had his reasons to leave, but I wish
he said something sooner. He didn't have to
leave us here in the desert, right Vyse?\e"
MD0030013,\h(«Vyse»)……\e
MD0030014,\h(«Aika»)… Vyse?\e
MD0030015,\h(«Aika»)……\e
MD0030016,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse!!!
Have you heard a single word I've said?!\e"
MD0030017,"\h(«Vyse»)Um…
Y… yeah. I'm listening… 
You were talking about the desert.\e"
MD0030018,"\h(«Aika»)You're acting like you've never seen a girl
before… If you could pry your eyes away from
that dancer for a few seconds…\e"
MD0030019,"\h(«What do you say?»)“Hehe… Okay, I'll stop staring.”
“I have no idea what you're talking about…”\e"
MD0030020,"\h(«Vyse»)Okay, okay. It's just that she's such a good
dancer… I didn't want to insult her by uh…
looking away. New lands, new customs y'know.\e"
MD0030021,"\h(«Aika»)What kind of excuse was that!? You're undressing
her with your eyes, not that it would take that
long. You weren't zooming in, were you?\e"
MD0030022,"\h(«Vyse»)I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But, seriously… don't you
think she's looked over here more than just a
few times? I think she likes me.\e"
MD0030023,\h(«Vyse»)I have no idea what you're talking about…\e
MD0030024,"\h(«Aika»)I swear…
The second a beautiful girl walks into the room,
you turn into a babbling idiot.\e"
MD0030025,"\h(«Vyse»)But, hey… I've caught her looking at me more
than a few times. I think she likes me.\e"
MD0030026,"\h(«Aika»)Yeah, right.
Fina, will you try and talk some sense into him?\e"
MD0030027,\h(«Fina»)… Do you really find it that hard to believe?\e
MD0030028,"\h(«Fina»)Well, Vyse is very attractive…
I don't think it would be strange at all if
that dancer was looking at him.\e"
MD0030029,"\h(«Aika»)Haha… You're kidding right? 
Vyse wouldn't want someone like her… I mean…
Who knows where she's been?\e"
MD0030030,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, umm… I, so umm… Do you travel a lot?\e"
MD0030031,"\h(«Dancer»)Tell me something… You wouldn't happen to be
the group of Air Pirates that escaped from
the Grand Fortress now, would you?\e"
MD0030032,"\h(«Vyse»)Huh?!
How did you know about that?\e"
MD0030033,"\h(«Dancer»)Well, if you hang out in places like this,
you overhear all kinds of things… rumors,
local gossip, news about the other lands…\e"
MD0030034,"\h(«Dancer»)… you even hear stories about Air Pirates
needing a ship.\e"
MD0030035,"\h(«Dancer»)If you want, I can give you a lift.
What do you say?\e"
MD0030036,"\h(«Vyse»)Really?!
Thanks! That'll help us a lot!\e"
MD0030037,"\h(«Aika»)Wait a second.
Why would you help us?
You don't even know who we are.\e"
MD0030038,"\h(«Dancer»)Let's just say that anyone who can escape from
the Valuan Grand Fortress, interests me.\e"
MD0030039,"\h(«Dancer»)My name is Bellena. I'll begin making
preparations. Meet me at the port first thing
tomorrow morning. See you around, handsome.\e"
MFD0030000,"\h(«Danseuse»)Tiens, bonjour, beau gosse.
C'est la première fois que je vous vois ici.\e"
MFD0030001,"\h(«Danseuse»)Tu dois être fatigué. 
Assieds-toi un petit moment.\e"
MFD0030002,"\h(«Que direz-vous ?»)“D'accord !”
“Nous n'avons pas vraiment le temps……”\e"
MFD0030003,"\h(«Vyse»)D'accord !
Un peu de repos nous ferait pas de mal.\e"
MFD0030004,"\h(«Danseuse»)Super ! Asseyez-vous et amusez-vous bien.
J'espère que vous aimerez le spectacle.\e"
MFD0030005,"\h(«Vyse»)Humm……
Nous n'avons pas vraiment le temps……\e"
MFD0030006,"\h(«Danseuse»)Il existe un proverbe à Maramba, “Buvez de l'eau
chaque fois que vous en avez l'occasion.”\e"
MFD0030007,"\h(«Danseuse»)Vous ne savez jamais quand vous pourrez vous
relaxer une nouvelle fois. Je vous suggère de
vous reposer tant que vous le pouvez.\e"
MFD0030008,"\h(«Aika»)Oh…… À Nasr, je suppose qu'ils s'assoient par
terre.\e"
MFD0030009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ah, cela fait du bien de s'asseoir enfin.\e"
MFD0030010,"\h(«Aika»)Bon, nous ne devrions pas nous reposer trop
longtemps, il faut chercher un navire. Je me
demande où nous pouvons en trouver un. Nous
devrions peut-être chercher sur les docks.\e"
MFD0030011,"\h(«Aika»)Je n'arrive pas à croire que Cap'taine Drachma
nous ait laissés ici……\e"
MFD0030012,"\h(«Aika»)Je suis sûre qu'il avait de bonnes raisons, mais
j'aurais préféré qu'il en parle d'abord. Il
n'était pas obligé de nous abandonner dans le
désert, n'est-ce pas Vyse ?\e"
MFD0030013,\h(«Vyse»)……\e
MFD0030014,\h(«Aika»)…… Vyse ?\e
MFD0030015,\h(«Aika»)……\e
MFD0030016,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse !!!
Est-ce que tu as entendu ce que je t'ai dit ?!\e"
MFD0030017,"\h(«Vyse»)Um……
O…… oui. J'écoute……
Tu parlais du désert.\e"
MFD0030018,"\h(«Aika»)Tu réagis comme si tu voyais une fille pour la
première fois…… Si tu pouvais détourner le
regard de cette danseuse pendant quelques
secondes……\e"
MFD0030019,"\h(«Que dites-vous ?»)“Héhé…… OK, j'arrête de la fixer.”
“Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles……”\e"
MFD0030020,"\h(«Vyse»)OK, OK Mais elle danse tellement bien…… que je
ne voulais pas l'insulter en, euh…… regardant
ailleurs, c'est tout. Nouveaux pays, nouvelles
coutumes, tu vois.\e"
MFD0030021,"\h(«Aika»)Ce n'est pas une excuse !? Tu la déshabilles du
regard, remarque cela ne prendrait pas
longtemps. Tu ne serais pas en train de loucher
sur elle, par hasard ?\e"
MFD0030022,"\h(«Vyse»)Je suis désolé, je suis désolé. Mais,
sérieusement…… tu ne crois pas qu'elle ait
regardé dans ma direction plusieurs fois ?
Je crois que je lui plais.\e"
MFD0030023,"\h(«Vyse»)Sinon, je ne sais pas de quoi tu parlais……\e"
MFD0030024,"\h(«Aika»)Je te jure……
Dès qu'une jolie fille entre dans la pièce, tu
deviens complètement idiot.\e"
MFD0030025,"\h(«Vyse»)Mais, hé…… je l'ai surprise en train de me
regarder plus d'une fois. J'ai bien l'impression
de lui plaire.\e"
MFD0030026,"\h(«Aika»)Oui, c'est cela.
Fina, essaye de le raisonner !\e"
MFD0030027,\h(«Fina»)…… C'est si dur que ça à croire ?\e
MFD0030028,"\h(«Fina»)Bon, Vyse est beau garçon…… Je ne trouve pas du
tout étrange que cette danseuse le regarde.\e"
MFD0030029,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… Tu plaisantes j'espère ?
Vyse ne s'intéresserait pas à quelqu'un comme
elle…… Je veux dire……
Qui sait d'où elle vient ?\e"
MFD0030030,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, umm…… je, alors umm……
Vous voyagez beaucoup ?\e"
MFD0030031,"\h(«Danseuse»)Dites-moi un peu…… Vous n'êtes pas les Pirates
de l'Air qui se sont échappés de la Grande
Forteresse, par hasard ?\e"
MFD0030032,"\h(«Vyse»)Hein ?!
Comment le savez-vous ?\e"
MFD0030033,"\h(«Danseuse»)Eh bien, si vous traînez dans des endroits comme
celui-là, vous entendez toutes sortes de
choses……  rumeurs, potins, nouvelles d'autres
pays……\e"
MFD0030034,"\h(«Danseuse»)…… on raconte même l'histoire de Pirates de
l'Air qui recherchent un navire.\e"
MFD0030035,"\h(«Danseuse»)Si vous voulez, je peux vous emmener.
Qu'en dites-vous ?\e"
MFD0030036,"\h(«Vyse»)Vraiment ?!
Merci ! Cela nous rendrait vraiment service !\e"
MFD0030037,"\h(«Aika»)Attends une seconde.
Pourquoi nous aideriez-vous ?
Vous ne nous connaissez même pas.\e"
MFD0030038,"\h(«Danseuse»)Disons que ceux qui arrivent à s'échapper de la
Grande Forteresse Valuanne m'intéressent.\e"
MFD0030039,"\h(«Danseuse»)Je m'appelle Bellena. Je vais commencer les
préparatifs. Retrouvez-moi demain matin au port.
À bientôt, beau gosse.\e"
MGD0030000,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Hallo, schöner Mann. Dich hab ich hier noch nie
vorher gesehen.\e"
MGD0030001,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Du musst müde sein.
Setz dich ein wenig.\e"
MGD0030002,"\h(«Was wirst du sagen?»)“Gerne!”
“Wir haben im Moment keine Zeit……”\e"
MGD0030003,"\h(«Vyse»)Gerne!
Ich glaube, wir könnten etwas Erholung
gebrauchen.\e"
MGD0030004,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Toll! Macht es euch bequem und genießt die Show.
Ich hoffe, euch gefällt, was ihr zu sehen
bekommt.\e"
MGD0030005,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm……
Wir sind gerade etwas beschäftigt……\e"
MGD0030006,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Hier in Maramba gibt es ein Sprichwort:
“Trink Wasser, wann immer du kannst.”\e"
MGD0030007,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Man kann nie wissen, wann man sich wieder einmal
entspannen kann. Ich schlage vor, ihr macht es
euch bequem, solange es geht.\e"
MGD0030008,"\h(«Aika»)Oh……
Schätze, in Nasr sitzt man einfach auf dem
Boden.\e"
MGD0030009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, tut gut, sich endlich mal hinzusetzen.\e"
MGD0030010,"\h(«Aika»)Tja, wir sollten uns nicht zu lange ausruhen,
wir müssen nach einem Schiff suchen. Ich frage
mich, wo wir wohl eines finden. Vielleicht
sollten wir es bei den Docks probieren.\e"
MGD0030011,"\h(«Aika»)Ich kann nicht fassen, dass Captain Drachma
uns einfach hier zurückgelassen hat……\e"
MGD0030012,"\h(«Aika»)Ich bin sicher, er hatte seine Gründe dafür,
aber hätte er doch schon früher was davon
erwähnt. Er musste uns ja nicht hier in der
Wüste zurücklassen, oder, Vyse?\e"
MGD0030013,\h(«Vyse»)……\e
MGD0030014,\h(«Aika»)……Vyse?\e
MGD0030015,\h(«Aika»)……\e
MGD0030016,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse!!!
Hast du ein einziges Wort von dem gehört, was
ich gesagt habe?\e"
MGD0030017,"\h(«Vyse»)Em…
J…… ja. Ich höre zu.
Du hast von der Wüste gesprochen.\e"
MGD0030018,"\h(«Aika»)Du führst dich auf, als hättest du noch nie
zuvor ein Mädchen gesehen…… Wenn du deine
Aufmerksamkeit vielleicht für ein paar Sekunden
von dieser Tänzerin abwenden könntest……\e"
MGD0030019,"\h(«Was sagst du?»)“Hihi, OK, ich höre auf, sie anzustarren.”
“Ich hab keine Ahnung, wovon du redest.”\e"
MGD0030020,"\h(«Vyse»)OK, OK. Sie ist nur eine verdammt gute
Tänzerin…… Ich wollte sie nicht beleidigen,
indem ich weggucke. Andere Länder, andere
Sitten, weißt du.\e"
MGD0030021,"\h(«Aika»)Schöne Entschuldigung!? Du ziehst sie ja
förmlich mit deinen Blicken aus -- obwohl es da
nicht mehr viel auszuziehen gibt. Du willst doch
nicht etwa was von ihr?\e"
MGD0030022,"\h(«Vyse»)Tut mir ja Leid. Aber im Ernst…… Findest du
nicht, dass sie ziemlich oft hier herüber
schaut? Ich glaube, sie mag mich.\e"
MGD0030023,"\h(«Vyse»)Keine Ahnung, wovon du redest.\e"
MGD0030024,"\h(«Aika»)Ich sag's ja……
In dem Moment, in dem ein hübsches Mädchen den
Raum betritt, verwandelst du dich in einen
sabbernden Idioten.\e"
MGD0030025,"\h(«Vyse»)Aber, he, ich habe gemerkt, dass sie schon ein
paar Mal zu mir herüber geschaut hat.
Ich glaube, sie mag mich.\e"
MGD0030026,"\h(«Aika»)Ja, klar.
Fina, kannst du nicht versuchen, ihm etwas
Vernunft beizubringen?\e"
MGD0030027,"\h(«Fina»)…… Findest du wirklich, dass das so schwer
nachzuvollziehen ist?\e"
MGD0030028,"\h(«Fina»)Nun, Vyse ist sehr attraktiv…… Es würde mich
nicht weiter wundern, wenn diese Tänzerin ihn
anschauen würde.\e"
MGD0030029,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… Du beliebst zu scherzen, nicht?
Vyse würde keine wie sie wollen…… ich meine……
Wer weiß, wo sie herkommt?\e"
MGD0030030,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, ähmm… ich, ähmm…… Reisen Sie viel?\e"
MGD0030031,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Sagt mal…… Ihr seid nicht zufällig die Gruppe
von Luftpiraten, die aus der Grand Fortress
geflohen ist, oder?\e"
MGD0030032,"\h(«Vyse»)Wie?!
Woher wusstest du denn davon?\e"
MGD0030033,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Nun, wenn man sich an Orten wie diesem aufhält,
hört man eine Menge Dinge…… Gerüchte,
Klatsch und Tratsch, Neuigkeiten über andere
Länder……\e"
MGD0030034,"\h(«Tänzerin»)…… Man hört sogar Geschichten von Luftpiraten,
die ein Schiff gebrauchen könnten.\e"
MGD0030035,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Wenn ihr wollt, kann ich euch mitnehmen.
Was meint ihr?\e"
MGD0030036,"\h(«Vyse»)Wirklich?!
Danke! Das bringt uns viel weiter!\e"
MGD0030037,"\h(«Aika»)Sekunde.
Warum willst du uns helfen?
Du weißt noch nicht einmal, wer wir sind.\e"
MGD0030038,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Sagen wir einfach, dass jeder, dem es gelingt,
aus der Grand Fortress von Valua zu fliehen,
mich sehr interessiert.\e"
MGD0030039,"\h(«Tänzerin»)Mein Name ist Bellena. Ich fange gleich mit
den Vorbereitungen an. Bis morgen früh
am Hafen. Man sieht sich, schöner Mann.\e"
MSD0030000,"\h(«Bailarina»)Hola, guapo.
Nunca te había visto por aquí.\e"
MSD0030001,"\h(«Bailarina»)Debes de estar cansado.
Siéntate y quédate un rato.\e"
MSD0030002,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decir?»)“¡Claro!”
“Ahora mismo estamos ocupados……”\e"
MSD0030003,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Claro!
Supongo que no nos vendría mal descansar un
poco.\e"
MSD0030004,"\h(«Bailarina»)¡Genial! Sentaos y divertíos con el espectáculo.
Espero que os guste lo que vais a ver.\e"
MSD0030005,"\h(«Vyse»)Mmm……
Ahora mismo estamos bastante ocupados……\e"
MSD0030006,"\h(«Bailarina»)Hay un dicho en Maramba, “Bebe agua siempre que
tengas la oportunidad”.\e"
MSD0030007,"\h(«Bailarina»)Nunca se sabe cuándo surgirá otra oportunidad
para relajarse. Os aconsejo que os lo toméis con
calma mientras podáis.\e"
MSD0030008,"\h(«Aika»)Oh……
Supongo que en Nasr, la gente se sienta en el
suelo.\e"
MSD0030009,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí, nos sentará bien sentarnos un rato.\e"
MSD0030010,"\h(«Aika»)Bueno, no deberíamos descansar mucho rato,
tenemos que buscar un navío. Me pregunto dónde
podríamos encontrar uno. Quizá deberíamos
intentarlo en los puertos.\e"
MSD0030011,"\h(«Aika»)No puedo creer que el Capitán Drachma nos haya
dejado aquí tirados……\e"
MSD0030012,"\h(«Aika»)Seguro que tenía muy buenas razones, pero podía
habernos avisado antes. No tenía por qué
dejarnos aquí en medio del desierto, ¿no crees,
Vyse?\e"
MSD0030013,\h(«Vyse»)……\e
MSD0030014,\h(«Aika»)¿……Vyse?\e
MSD0030015,\h(«Aika»)……\e
MSD0030016,"\h(«Aika»)¡¡¡Vyse!!!
¡¿Has oído una sola palabra de lo que he dicho?!\e"
MSD0030017,"\h(«Vyse»)Um……
Sí…… sí. Te estoy escuchando…… Decías algo sobre
el desierto.\e"
MSD0030018,"\h(«Aika»)Parece que no hayas visto a una chica antes……
Si pudieses apartar los ojos de esa bailarina
unos segundos……\e"
MSD0030019,"\h(«¿Qué dirías?»)“Je je…… Vale, dejaré de mirar.”
“No tengo ni idea de lo que estás hablando……”\e"
MSD0030020,"\h(«Vyse»)Vale, vale. Es que baila tan bien…… que no
quería insultarla mirando…… hacia otro lado.
Nuevas tierras, nuevas costumbres, ya sabes.\e"
MSD0030021,"\h(«Aika»)¿¡Qué clase de pretexto es ése!? La estás
desnudando con la mirada, lo cual no creo te
lleve mucho tiempo. No tendrás mirada de
telescopio, ¿eh?\e"
MSD0030022,"\h(«Vyse»)Perdón, perdón. Ahora en serio…… ¿no te parece
que ha lanzado varias miradas hacia aquí?
Creo que le gusto.\e"
MSD0030023,\h(«Vyse»)No sé de qué rayos hablas……\e
MSD0030024,"\h(«Aika»)Lo juro……
Cada vez que una chica guapa aparece en escena,
te vuelves un bobo integral.\e"
MSD0030025,"\h(«Vyse»)Pero, oye…… La he pillado mirándome varias
veces. Creo que le gusto.\e"
MSD0030026,"\h(«Aika»)Sí, ya.
Fina, ¿por qué no intentas que razone?\e"
MSD0030027,\h(«Fina»)…… ¿De verdad te parece tan difícil de creer?\e
MSD0030028,"\h(«Fina»)Bueno, Vyse es muy atractivo…… No me parecería
nada extraño si la bailarina le estuviera
mirando.\e"
MSD0030029,"\h(«Aika»)Jaja…… ¿Estás de broma?
A Vyse no le gustan las chicas así…… Es decir……
¿Quién sabe dónde ha estado?\e"
MSD0030030,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, mmm…… Yo, esto…… ¿Viajas mucho?\e"
MSD0030031,"\h(«Bailarina»)Decidme una cosa…… ¿No seréis por casualidad el
grupo de Piratas Aéreos que escapó de la Gran
Fortaleza?\e"
MSD0030032,"\h(«Vyse»)¡¿Qué?!
¿Cómo te has enterado de eso?\e"
MSD0030033,"\h(«Bailarina»)Bueno, si frecuentas lugares como éste, oyes
todo tipo de cosas…… rumores, cotilleos,
noticias sobre otras tierras……\e"
MSD0030034,"\h(«Bailarina»)……Hasta se oyen historias sobre Piratas Aéreos
que necesitan un navío.\e"
MSD0030035,"\h(«Bailarina»)Yo os puedo llevar si queréis.
¿Qué decís?\e"
MSD0030036,"\h(«Vyse»)¡¿En serio?! ¡Gracias!
¡Eso nos será de gran ayuda!\e"
MSD0030037,"\h(«Aika»)Espera un segundo.
¿Por qué nos quieres ayudar?
Ni siquiera nos conoces.\e"
MSD0030038,"\h(«Bailarina»)Digamos que cualquiera que pueda escapar de la
Gran Fortaleza Valuan despierta mi interés.\e"
MSD0030039,"\h(«Bailarina»)Me llamo Bellena. Empezaré con los preparativos.
Nos vemos en el puerto a primera hora de la
mañana. Hasta pronto, guapetón.\e"
