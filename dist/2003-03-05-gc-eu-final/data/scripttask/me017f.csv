M01000000,"\h(«Polly»)This place isn't bad. It sort of reminds me
of my tavern back on Sailors' Island.\e"
M01000001,\h(«Polly»)I think I'll be able to cook here… \e
M01000002,"\h(«Polly»)But, the kitchen could use a little work.
It needs some remodeling if I'm going to make
some of my more popular dishes.\c"
M01000003,"\h(«Polly»)If you let me remodel the place, I'll be able 
to open a tavern here on your island.\c"
M01000004,"\h(«Polly»)Well, now that I have a kitchen that I can use,
I'll just need some cooking supplies so I can
get started.\e"
M01000005,"\h(«Polly»)Hmm… I can get everything that I need for 
1,000 gold.\e"
M01000006,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Give 1,000 gold to Polly.”
“Not right now.”\e"
M01000007,"\h( )You gave Polly 1,000 gold.\e"
M01000008,"\h(«Polly»)Thank you, Vyse! You won't be disappointed.
I'll start to get things ready right away!\c"
M01000009,"\h(«Polly»)Thanks for the offer, but you don't have enough
gold right now. I'd be more than happy to start
cooking if you can get the gold.\e"
M01000010,"\h(«Polly»)As soon as I can get 1,000 gold, I'll be able to
start cooking for everyone. I can't wait!\c"
M01000011,"\h(«Polly»)If you come back a little later, 
I'll have some food ready for you.\c"
M01000100,"\h(«Polly»)Now that my kitchen is fully stocked, 
I can start cooking the good stuff.\e"
M01000101,"\h(«Polly»)Actually, would you like me to make something
for you that will help you on your mission?\e"
M01000102,"\h(«Polly»)All the sailors used to call it a 
“Polly Special.” I just need 10 “Grules”.
They're a specific type of flying fish.\e"
M01000103,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Order a Polly Special.”
“Come back some other time.”\e"
M01000104,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, I've got 10 Grules right here.\e"
M01000105,"\h(«Polly»)Wow, you're always prepared, aren't you Vyse?
Just sit tight, one “Polly Special” comin' right
up!\e"
M01000106,"\h(«Polly»)… Thanks for waiting!
Here you go!\e"
M01000107,"\h(«Polly»)It will heal your wounds, as well as replenish 
your magic, but it takes a little while to take 
effect, so don't eat it during a battle.\e"
M01000108,\h( )You received a “Polly Special.”\c
M01000109,"\h(«Polly»)Sorry, Vyse, but it looks like you don't have
enough Grules. It's alright, though. Just come
back when you do.\c"
M01000110,"\h(«Polly»)If you bring me 10 Grules, I'll make you a
“Polly Special.” You'll love it!\c"
M01000111,"\h(«Polly»)Hm? You already have more than enough to eat!
Come back once you've finished what I've cooked
for you already.\c"
M01000023,"\h(«Polly»)Hello, Vyse. What can I do for you?\e"
M01000024,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Have Polly cook some food.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M01000025,"\h(«Polly»)You want to eat some good old-fashioned sailor
food? Leave it to me!\c"
M01000026,"\h(«Polly»)Yafutoman food tastes pretty good, too!\e"
M01000027,"\h(«Polly»)I was watching Urala cook earlier. She makes the
broth for her soup from fish.
It tastes great!\c"
M01000028,"\h(«Polly»)I'll be able to open my kitchen in a little 
while. Don't worry about a thing!\c"
M01000029,"\h(«Polly»)Hello, Vyse. Do you want something?\e"
M01000030,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Have Polly cook some food.”
“Come back later.”\e"
M01000031,"\h(«Polly»)You want to eat some good old-fashioned sailor
food? Leave it to me!\c"
M01000032,"\h(«Polly»)I never thought that I'd ever see Robinson
again.\e"
M01000033,"\h(«Polly»)Thank you for everything you've done for me,
Vyse. I'm so glad that I came with you…\c"
M01000034,"\h(«Polly»)I'll be able to open my kitchen in a little 
while. Don't worry about a thing!\c"
M01000043,"\h(«Polly»)It's nice to take a break from cooking and eat
some of Urala's food. It's great!\c"
M01140032,"\h(«Pinta»)Alright, if I can catch any of them, I'll bring
them back to Crescent Isle, okay?\c"
M01140033,"\h(«Pinta»)I've found a lot of islands where some really
interesting animals live!\e"
M01140034,"\h(«Pinta»)Where is the island, you ask? Heh… It's a
secret. Well, if you're only interested in
the animals, I can bring some back here.\e"
M01140035,"\h(«Pinta»)It will take 500 gold to pay for their food and
stuff. Do you still want me to catch some for
you?\e"
M01140036,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Go ahead and catch some for me, Pinta.”
“On second thought, never mind.”\e"
M01140037,"\h(«Vyse»)Some animals, huh? Hmm… It might be nice to
have some pets around here. Well, why not.
Go ahead and catch some for the island, okay?\e"
M01140038,"\h(«Pinta»)Aye aye!
But first, what kind of animals would you like?\e"
M01140039,"\h(«What kind do you want?»)“Something cute from the east.”
“Something colorful from the south.”
“Something scary-looking from the west.”\e"
M01140040,"\h(«Pinta»)You don't have enough money!
Well, just come back when you do and I'll take
care of everything for you, okay?\c"
M01140041,"\h(«Pinta»)Well, alright. I think having some pets around
here would be nice, though. Just let me know if
you change your mind, okay?\c"
M01140042,"\h(«Pinta»)Hey! Do you like the little animals that I
caught for you?\e"
M01140043,"\h(«What will you say to Pinta?»)“They're perfect!”
“Hmm… I'd like to see a different one.”\e"
M01140044,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah, they're perfect!
I like them a lot. Thanks for catching them,
Pinta.\e"
M01140045,"\h(«Pinta»)That's great! I'm glad you like them.
Well, just in case you ever want to have some
different animals here, just let me know!\c"
M01140046,"\h(«Vyse»)I like the animals that you brought, Pinta, but
I was wondering what the other animals looked
like…\e"
M01140047,"\h(«Pinta»)Well, if you want me to get another kind of
animal, it will cost 500 gold.\e"
M01140048,"\h(«Pinta»)And, if we mix the different types of animals on
this island, they might fight, so I'll have to
return these animals to their island, okay?\e"
M01140049,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Hm… Forget about it then.”
“Sure, bring something different this time.”\e"
M01140050,"\h(«Pinta»)Well, just in case you ever want to have some
different animals here, just let me know!\c"
M01140051,"\h(«Pinta»)You don't have enough money!
Well, just come back when you do and I'll take
care of everything for you, okay?\c"
M01140052,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright. I'm counting on you, Pinta.\e"
M01140053,"\h(«Pinta»)Aye aye!
But first, what kind of animals would you like?\e"
M01140054,"\h(«What kind do you want?»)“Something colorful from the south.”
“Something scary-looking from the west.”\e"
M01140055,"\h(«What kind do you want?»)“Something cute from the east.”
“Something scary-looking from the west.”\e"
M01140056,"\h(«What kind do you want?»)“Something cute from the east.”
“Something colorful from the south.”\e"
M01140057,"\h(«Pinta»)Well, just in case you ever want to have some
different animals here, just let me know!\c"
M01140058,"\h(«Vyse»)I guess I'll go with the cute ones. Otherwise,
Aika will probably start complaining.\e"
M01140059,"\h(«Pinta»)Aye aye!
I'll go catch some right away!\e"
M01140060,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, I think we need a little color around
here. Go catch some colorful little creatures
for me, okay?\e"
M01140061,"\h(«Pinta»)Aye aye!
I'll go catch some right away!\e"
M01140062,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh… Well, since we're Air Pirates, we should
probably get some scary looking pets.\e"
M01140063,"\h(«Pinta»)Aye aye!
I'll go catch some right away!\e"
M02000000,"\h(«Marco»)I never thought that I would ever be able to get
out of Valua. And I never knew the outside
world was so big!\e"
M02000001,"\h(«Marco»)After your little pep talk, I've been wanting to
see as much of the world as I can. Thanks, Vyse!
I can't wait to go sailing again!\c"
M02000002,"\h(«Marco»)Heh… The biggest surprise for me after getting 
out of Valua was probably the sky… It's blue. 
I've never seen a blue sky before…\e"
M02000003,"\h(«Marco»)And the clouds are white! I thought they were 
all dark like the ones in Valua!\e"
M02000004,"\h(«Marco»)Hey, don't laugh! If you lived in Lower City 
your whole life, you'd understand!\c"
M02000005,"\h(«Marco»)So, how's the ship's new engine doing?\e"
M02000006,"\h(«Marco»)Heh… Who'd have thought that I'd become an 
engineer… I actually help build that thing! I 
did a pretty good job if I do say so myself.\c"
M02000007,"\h(«Marco»)Welcome back, Vyse! I bet you were surprised to 
find the island all fixed up, weren't you?\e"
M02000008,"\h(«Marco»)I helped Izmael a lot, too! Okay, well… I only 
painted the walls, but it was still a lot of
work!\c"
M02000009,"\h(«Marco»)Hey, you guys saw the shooting stars that were
falling over Valua, right?\e"
M02000010,"\h(«Marco»)Ever since that happened, you and Aika have been
looking pretty upset. What's up? Did something
bad happen?\c"
M02000011,"\h(«Marco»)The Armada made the Moon Stones fall on Valua,
huh?\e"
M02000012,"\h(«Marco»)I… I didn't really like the place, but… I grew
up there. It makes me sad that it's all gone.\e"
M02000013,"\h(«Marco»)Vyse, promise me that we'll beat the Armada. 
We can't let them get away with what they've
done.\c"
M02000014,"\h(«Marco»)We have to stop them before they destroy all of
the other lands. There's so much I haven't seen
yet.\c"
M04090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Welcome. Listen to my words and the path of
light will be shown to you…\e"
M04090001,"\h(«Will you have your fortune told?»)“Pay 10 gold for your fortune.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M04090002,"\h(«Kalifa»)Remember my words and heed them carefully.
Now go forth and fulfill your destiny.\c"
M04090003,"\h(«Kalifa»)One more thing… the Red Moon requires a better
tent to properly bestow its wisdom unto me. I
cannot work well in these… conditions.\c"
M04090004,"\h(«Kalifa»)Welcome. Heed my words and the future will be
known…\e"
M04090005,"\h(«Will you have your fortune told?»)“Pay 10 gold for your fortune.”
“Pay 100 gold for your fortune.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M04090006,"\h(«Kalifa»)Welcome. Listen to my words and the path of
light will be shown to you…\e"
M04090007,"\h(«Will you have your fortune told?»)“Pay 10 gold for your fortune.”
“Pay 100 gold for your fortune.”
“Maybe some other time.”\e"
M04090008,\h( )You gave 10 gold to Kalifa.\e
M04090009,"\h(«Kalifa»)Very well.
Let us begin.\c"
M04090010,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm…\e
M04090011,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa!!!\e
M04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Remember to chew your
food well before swallowing!\e"
M04090013,"\h(«Kalifa»)That way you won't choke on it, 
and it also aids the digestion process.\c"
M04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Having a low
“Swashbuckler Rating” will affect your mission!\e"
M04090015,"\h(«Kalifa»)When you have a low rating, it will become
easier to run from fights and easier to avoid
them all together!\c"
M04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Hmm… it looks like
tomorrow will be partly cloudy and there is
chance of rain in some areas.\e"
M04090017,"\h(«Kalifa»)So, if you have any laundry out to dry, you
better bring it inside today!\c"
M04090018,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Having a high
“Swashbuckler Rating” will affect the morale
of your crew in a positive manner.\e"
M04090019,"\h(«Kalifa»)Your bravery will show through in battle,
as well! Your fighting abilities will raise
depending on your ability as a leader!\c"
M04090020,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! On… Pirate Isle…
the little girl named Lindsi… Oh, no!
She will be playing on the dock and… and…\e"
M04090021,"\h(«Kalifa»)… and she's going to get a splinter in her
finger!\c"
M04090022,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! A woman from a tavern
and a man who sits alone in silence will be
reunited!\e"
M04090023,"\h(«Kalifa»)And they will live happily ever after once 
they are together again as husband and wife. 
Such a happy ending…\c"
M04090024,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Your lucky number is
81. Your lucky color is white.\e"
M04090025,"\h(«Kalifa»)Couples should spend more time outdoors!
It's more romantic outside…\c"
M04090026,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! On Sailors' Island,
there are some rare items for sale.\e"
M04090027,"\h(«Kalifa»)So, be sure to check back there as often as
possible to see what new wares are in the
merchants' possession!\c"
M04090028,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! You will meet many
people during your travels. You will also part
with many people…\e"
M04090029,"\h(«Kalifa»)What? You say that could be anyone's fortune?!
Skeptic! You must learn to accept your own fate.
Then you will learn your true purpose.\c"
M04090030,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! In this world, there
are 3 special Chams called Abirik Chams.\e"
M04090031,"\h(«Kalifa»)You never know where you'll get them from, so
make sure to be nice to people… they may
surprise you with a gift.\c"
M04090032,"\h(«Kalifa»)Defensive techniques only last for one round,
but their effect is guaranteed.\e"
M04090033,"\h(«Kalifa»)So, if you can anticipate your enemies moves,
you will be able to render their attacks
ineffective.\c"
M04090034,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Once you are the
captain of your own ship and your Spirits
are as high as they can be…\e"
M04090035,"\h(«Kalifa»)You will gain the power to call forth all of
your allies to battle by your side.\c"
M04090036,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Your crew will react
differently depending on the condition of your
ship.\e"
M04090037,"\h(«Kalifa»)Once you have a crew, talk to them often.
Especially when all seems lost.\c"
M04090038,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! If you want to
make your cannons more effective, seek out
a “Gunner” for your crew.\e"
M04090039,"\h(«Kalifa»)On the other hand, if you wish to increase the
defensive power of your ship, then you should
find an “Engineer” to help maintain it.\c"
M04090040,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Princess Moegi will 
find love. But that love will cause her great
pain.\e"
M04090041,"\h(«Kalifa»)I… I cannot see more. The future hangs in the
balance. You must be strong, for you carry the
fate of the world on your shoulders.\c"
M04090042,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! If you always stand
your ground in a fight, word will spread
amongst the people of your bravery.\e"
M04090043,"\h(«Kalifa»)On the other hand, if you always flee from your
adversaries, the people will learn of your
cowardice. Be careful in your actions.\c"
M04090044,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! When a Moon Stone 
becomes contaminated, it becomes a “Chom.”
The have the opposite effect as “Chams.”\e"
M04090045,"\h(«Kalifa»)Giving Cupil a Chom will result in him
regurgitating all of the Chams that he has eaten
up until that point. Use them wisely.\c"
M04090046,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Tonight, you must
avoid eating fish at all costs!\e"
M04090047,"\h(«Kalifa»)If you do, it will upset your stomach and you
will feel a sickness many times worse than that
caused by air travel.\c"
M04090048,\h(«Kalifa»)… Nothing. I see nothing.\e
M04090049,"\h(«Kalifa»)Well, just consider the gold that you spent as
an investment in your future.\c"
M04090050,\h(«Kalifa»)… Nothing. I see nothing.\e
M04090051,"\h(«Kalifa»)Well, just consider the gold that you spent as
an investment in your future.\c"
M04090052,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!\e"
M04090053,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ancient wisdom will fall because of what a young
heart feels.\c"
M04090054,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!
I see great danger in your immediate future!\e"
M04090055,"\h(«Kalifa»)A great evil takes many shapes, 
but in reality… It has none.
That is all I can say, for now.\c"
M04090056,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!
But it is cloudy… Perhaps another 10 gold 
tomorrow will clear things up!\e"
M04090057,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hey, fortune tellers have to eat too, you know.
\c"
M04090058,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!
I see a Moon Stone! But, it's color is…\e"
M04090059,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hard to see. It's not red. Nor is it purple, 
blue, or green. Nor is it yellow, or silver. 
It's a color that I've never seen.\c"
M04090060,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!\e"
M04090061,"\h(«Kalifa»)There is more to Deep Sky, than meets the eye!
Use caution, Vyse, for there is great evil under
the clouds.\c"
M04090072,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken.
Remember my words and heed them carefully.
Now go forth and fulfill your destiny.\c"
M04090073,\h( )You gave 100 gold to Kalifa.\e
M04090074,"\h(«Kalifa»)Very well.
Let us begin.\c"
M04090075,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm…\e
M04090076,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa!!!\e
M04090077,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere above the
skies of Valua, there lives a man who studies
for the betterment of the world.\e"
M04090078,"\h(«Kalifa»)If you show this man the wisdom in your souls,
perhaps he will join you on your quest and aid
your cause.\c"
M04090079,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere in the
lands to the east, there exists an island
populated by curious little creatures.\e"
M04090080,"\h(«Kalifa»)Search for this island to the north of the great
mountain. Perhaps you will find something useful
there.\c"
M04090081,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere in the dark
storm, there are strange stones that give off a
black light.\e"
M04090082,"\h(«Kalifa»)Perhaps these stones are a window to the past
and speak of untold tragedies of the days of
old.\c"
M04090083,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere beneath the
clouds of the dark storm, there exists a type of
fish that has remained unchanged over the ages.\e"
M04090084,"\h(«Kalifa»)Perhaps these fish will be of some use to you.
Go forth and seek them out.\c"
M04090085,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! To the north of
Yafutoma, there lives a man whose soul burns
with the fires of his forge.\e"
M04090086,"\h(«Kalifa»)He is a proud old man. Do not expect his help
unless you believe yourself truly worthy of his
craftsmanship.\c"
M04090087,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere in the
skies above the desert, there exists a cold,
unburning star of metal.\e"
M04090088,"\h(«Kalifa»)The people of the ancient world built this
star with their own hands. What purpose it
served is not known even to me.\c"
M04090089,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! South of the forest
islands, there is a being that forever looks to
the skies.\e"
M04090090,"\h(«Kalifa»)Search near the island that is divided by stone
reefs. Perhaps you will find what you seek.\c"
M04090091,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! South of the forest
islands, there is a being that forever looks to
the skies.\e"
M04090092,"\h(«Kalifa»)Search near the island that is divided by stone
reefs. Perhaps you will find what you seek.\c"
M04090093,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! The man who seeks
nothing more than food can help you in your
search for exotic ingredients.\e"
M04090094,"\h(«Kalifa»)It would appear that he used to be an Air Pirate
himself. Go forth and seek him out.\c"
M04090095,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! In the place of your
birth… in your father's study… there is a
secret pathway behind his bookshelf.\e"
M04090096,"\h(«Kalifa»)If you have not found it yet, that probably
means that you're not a very good treasure
hunter, I suppose.\c"
M04090097,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Aika… your secret
stash of gold is hidden…\e"
M04090098,"\h(«Aika»)Hey! You don't have to tell everyone! What's the
point of having a secret stash if you're just
going to tell everyone where it is?!\c"
M04090099,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! There is a place upon
which the Moons cast their shadows.\e"
M04090100,"\h(«Kalifa»)It is located high above the clouds. You will
know that you have reached the area when
everything around you grows dark.\c"
M04090101,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon speaks!!
There is a lone island,
above the demon's storm.\e"
M04090102,"\h(«Kalifa»)It is a mysterious place... It is inhabited by
strange bird-like creatures, dancing and
frolicking. You must find this place.\e"
M04090103,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Far above the skies
of Ixa'taka, stands a building of ancient
design!\e"
M04090104,"\h(«Kalifa»)The people of the Old World worked wonders with
their technology and power. Perhaps we can all
learn from their success… and their failure.\c"
M04090105,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! In the city of the
forests, there is a woman who vows vengeance on
those who have wronged her.\e"
M04090106,"\h(«Kalifa»)She awaits the person that will answer her
prayers. But she will need proof that you are
that answer.\c"
M04090107,"\h(«Kalifa»)… I see nothing.
Come back another time.
I must rest.\e"
M04090108,"\h(«Kalifa»)Can you blame me? It is impossible to work all
the time. I suppose that even you, the great
Vyse, must stop and rest on occasion, right?\c"
M04090109,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Somewhere above the
clouds, a ship without a crew aimlessly wanders
through the skies.\e"
M04090110,"\h(«Kalifa»)I see beneath the ship, I see nothing but
darkness… Perhaps you should try searching
somewhere above the Dark Rift.\c"
M04090111,"\h(«Kalifa»)Somewhere, you found a single coin bearing the
mark of a legend.\e"
M04090112,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Guildmaster in Nasrad has been searching for
such a coin for a very long time. Perhaps he
will be willing to pay handsomely for it.\c"
M04090113,"\h(«Kalifa»)My skills do not end with fortune-telling. 
Take me onboard your ship once in a while.\e"
M04090114,"\h(«Kalifa»)If you win a ship battle with me onboard, I will
find rare items for you… if I feel you are
worthy.\c"
M04090115,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! In the ruins of
Nasrad, there is a once-proud woman, sitting
amidst the ashes of her store.\e"
M04090116,"\h(«Kalifa»)Perhaps she would be of some use in your crew.
She is quite skilled in acquiring rare and
unusual items after ship battles.\c"

Come back another time.
I must rest.\e"

M04090137,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken. Remember it always
and the way will be clear to you.\c"
M04090138,\h( )You gave 100 gold to Kalifa.\e
M04090139,"\h(«Kalifa»)Very well.
Let us begin.\c"
M04090140,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm…\e
M04090141,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa!!!\e
M04090142,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! There are monsters in
this world that cannot be defeated by a blade.
These giant beasts must be fought by ship.\e"
M04090143,"\h(«Kalifa»)One of them lives in the Lands of Ice.
It appears to be some sort of giant insect…\c"
M04090144,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has granted me a vision!
You must feed the doctor's bird with fish that
cannot be seen.\e"
M04090145,"\h(«Kalifa»)Your generosity will be rewarded in turn for
that bird holds treasures unlike any you have
seen before. That is all.\e"
M04090146,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! You will encounter
the treasure thief, Zivilyn Bane, eight times
throughout your adventures.\e"
M04090147,"\h(«Kalifa»)He only goes after treasures of legend. Whenever
you encounter him, rest assured, you will find
valuable treasure nearby.\c"
M04090148,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! If you are trying to
save up some money, you should fight plenty of
Kanezls.\e"
M04090149,"\h(«Kalifa»)The “Gold Pollen” of these creatures fetches a
high price on the market. If you happen to
acquire some, be sure to sell it immediately.\c"
M04090150,\h(«Kalifa»)… The future is cloudy. The Red Moon is silent.\e
M04090151,"\h(«Kalifa»)I'm sorry, but perhaps you should come back
another day. I shall keep your 100 gold to
help clear my mind…\c"
M04090152,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! The necessary
materials to build a great sword rest far
beneath the clouds.\e"
M04090153,"\h(«Kalifa»)If you pass those materials onto the right
person, he will forge for you a blade unlike
any other in this world.\c"
M04090154,"\h(«Kalifa»)There is an item called the “White Map” that
reveals the paths that enemies take, thus
reducing encounters with potential attackers.\e"
M04090155,"\h(«Kalifa»)So, by wearing this item, you would be able to
make it safely through even the most monster-
infested lands unharmed.\c"
M04090156,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! I have seen where the
3 Abirik Chams of this world are located.\e"
M04090157,"\h(«Kalifa»)One is somewhere in the skies of Ixa'taka,
another is somewhere in Esparanza, and the last
is in Nasrad. Find out who has them!\c"
M04090158,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! The Red spell
“Increm” also works to help boost the offensive
power of you ship's cannons!\e"
M04090159,"\h(«Kalifa»)Be sure to use it to your advantage as often as
possible.\c"
M04090160,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Your ship has an
attribute called “Value.”\e"
M04090161,"\h(«Kalifa»)Depending on what parts you have equipped on
your ship, it will rise and fall, but it does
not have any effect on your ship's power.\c"
M04090162,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! When you connect with
the “other world,” a humongous monster will
appear!\e"
M04090163,"\h(«Kalifa»)It will be a much larger version of a beast that
you have already encountered numerous times.
Will you be able to defeat it?\c"
M04090164,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something!
On occasion, you will encounter a mysterious
travelling merchant.\e"
M04090165,"\h(«Kalifa»)That merchant travels the world and acquires
rare and unusual items unavailable anywhere
else!\c"
M04090166,"\h(«Kalifa»)A vision from the Red Moon! Seek your mirror
images. You will be granted weapons of great
power if you can defeat yourself in combat.\e"
M04090167,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hm... There's something strange about these
weapons... Something smells fishy about this
whole thing...\e"
M04090168,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! There are 30 Chams in
this world.\e"
M04090169,"\h(«Kalifa»)Go forth and find all of them. Perhaps you will
be able to raise Cupil well enough to help him
reach his true form.\c"
M04090170,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! I'm sure that you
know some monsters carry items on them.\e"
M04090171,"\h(«Kalifa»)However, sometimes those very same monsters
carry extremely rare items that cannot be found
in any store anywhere.\c"

M04090174,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! Speed plays an
important factor in ship battles.\e"
M04090175,"\h(«Kalifa»)If you have a fast ship, you will have a better
chance of attacking first, and your cannons
will also have a better chance of hitting.\c"
M04090176,"\h(«Kalifa»)… Hmm. Nothing. My Moon Stone is not responding
to me at all.\e"
M04090177,"\h(«Kalifa»)I'm very sorry, but you will have to come back
another time. I cannot see anything if my Moon
Stone is not responding properly.\c"
M04090178,"\h(«Kalifa»)In this world, there is an item called the
“Black Map.”\e"
M04090179,"\h(«Kalifa»)It will increase the bearer's aggressiveness,
causing him to get into more fights than usual.
It has its uses…\c"
M04090180,"\h(«Kalifa»)Yes, yes! I see something! On occasion, Cupil
will grow very hungry and behave strangely.\e"
M04090181,"\h(«Kalifa»)If you were to give him an Abirik Cham at that
point, he will change in ways that you would not
normally be able to see.\c"
M04090182,"\h(«Kalifa»)A vision from the Red Moon! Seek your mirror
images. You will be granted weapons of great
power if you can defeat yourself in combat.\e"

If you ever need the guidance of the Red Moon,
do not hesistate to come back.\c"
M04090205,"\h(«Kalifa»)The Red Moon has spoken.
Remember my words and heed them carefully.
Now go forth and fulfill your destiny.\c"
M05030000,"\h(«Merida»)Izmael promised me that he would build a
stage for me to dance on, but he does not
have enough money.\e"
M05030001,"\h(«Merida»)Do you have more money? Izmael said it would
take 500 gold to build.\e"
M05030002,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Pay the 500 gold.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M05030003,"\h(«Merida»)Really? You will pay for the new stage?
Thank you! I will tell Izmael right now!\c"
M05030004,"\h(«Merida»)I'm very happy you offered, but you don't have
enough money…\c"
M05030005,"\h(«Merida»)Dancing is my life. It makes me sad when I
cannot dance…\c"
M05030006,"\h(«Merida»)I dance in your honor! I dance in celebration of
your victory to come!
You will win!!\c"
M05030007,"\h(«Merida»)Kirala gave me this dress. She says it is the
traditional clothes for Yafutoman women when
they have celebrations.\e"
M05030008,"\h(«Merida»)I would like to wear this while dancing, but it
does not move well enough. Kirala said it would
take 500 gold to fix it. Do you have the money?\e"
M05030009,"\h(«Merida»)Really? Thank you very much!
I will give the money to Kirala right away!\c"
M05030010,"\h(«Merida»)I'm very happy you offered, but you don't have
enough money…\c"
M05030011,"\h(«Merida»)I want to dance while wearing this dress.
It is very beautiful…\c"
M05030012,"\h(«Merida»)Do you like this dance? Urala showed it to me!
It is a traditional Yafutoman dance!
I love it!\c"
M05100000,"\h(«Hans»)I'm learning all about shipbuilding from Brabham
right now.\e"
M05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Brabham is an expert on all kinds of engines,
from old models to new models, so I learn a lot
from him!\e"
M05100002,\h(«Hans»)He let me see the Yaftoman Book on Polarity.\e
M05100003,"\h(«Hans»)I learned how to build an engine using wave 
motion technology, and how to rig the sail 
so your ship can hover. I learned so much!\c"
M05100004,"\h(«Hans»)Building that new engine was quite a bit of
work. That old man Brabham is a machine! I
can't believe how hard he works!\e"
M05100005,"\h(«Hans»)He must be tired from all those all-nighters, 
but he doesn't show it. He is so energetic, 
especially at his age!\c"
M05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Well, we've managed to rebuild the base, but we
still need to get ready for the assault on
the Armada.\e"
M05100007,"\h(«Hans»)Did you notice how fast some of those ships 
were, and the ones that can dive below the
clouds?\e"
M05100008,"\h(«Hans»)If only Valua would use their technology to help
people…\c"
M05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse…
The time has finally come for battle…\e"

his ship, the Ironclad, is ready to fight along
side of us!\e"
M05100011,"\h(«Hans»)The preparations on the Delphinus are being
finished up as we speak! The whole crew is

M05210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)Hey Captain, I can watch over the entire island 
from up here.\e"
M05210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nothing special happened today. Well, except
that Izmael took some of Brabham's food when
he wasn't looking.\c"
M05210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nothing to report today. Well, except that Marco
has a stomach ache. I think he drank water from
the pond…\c"
M05210003,"\h(«Tikatika»)Stay away from the pond. Prince Enrique and 
Princess Moegi are saying their final farewells 
before he leaves. Do not invade their privacy.\c"
M05210004,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nothing to report today. But, I did notice that 
Princess Moegi seems to be going to the pond 
every day to pray…\c"
M05210005,"\h(«Tikatika»)Welcome back, Captain. I was trying to see where
you were going in that little boat, but…\e"
M05210006,"\h(«Tikatika»)I can't quite see the Silver Shrine, even with 
my eyes. It must be standing at a very high 
place. I am a little surprised.\e"
M05210007,"\h(«Tikatika»)I can't quite see that island that rose up 
from under the clouds from here… 
even with my eagle-like eyes.\e"
M05210008,"\h(«Tikatika»)But, I can sense the fear of the birds that come
from the direction of Mid Ocean. I have a very
bad feeling about all of this…\e"
M05210009,"\h(«Tikatika»)Nothing to report today. Heh… I can see
everyone from here!\e"
M05210010,"\h(«Tikatika»)Everyone is so energetic! I can feel their 
spirit. I'm sure we will win the battle 
against the Armada!\c"
M07060000,"\h(«Don»)When I heard this place used to be a desert
island, I figured it would be even more
depressing than Esparanza.\e"
M07060001,"\h(«Don»)But, you've got a good variety of food and 
drinks here, and you've assembled quite a crew. 
You're doing a great job!\c"
M07060002,"\h(«Don»)Polly is the best cook ever!
The stuff she makes is amazing!\e"
M07060003,"\h(«Don»)If it wasn't for you, I'd still be wallowing in 
self pity back on Esparanza.\c"
M07060004,"\h(«Don»)I've never had Yafutoman food before. It's 
great! If I made it through the Dark Rift, 
I would have discovered it a long time ago.\e"
M07060005,"\h(«Don»)I'm glad that I came with you, Vyse. 
Sailing with your crew is the most fun I've ever
had.\c"
M07060006,"\h(«Don»)Into Deep Sky, huh? I couldn't even make it 
through the Dark Rift. Now I'm about to sail 
into the underworld with you.\e"
M07060007,"\h(«Don»)Vyse, I gotta tell ya. There's never a dull 
moment when you're around. To say that you are 
inspirational would be an understatement.\e"
M07060008,"\h(«Don»)We all would have made it through the Dark Rift
if you were around back then.\c"
M07060009,"\h(«Don»)Hey, I really want to hear about the Great
Silver Shrine!\e"
M07060010,"\h(«Don»)While you were off adventuring, I was bustin' 
my butt working on these buildings.\c"
M07060011,"\h(«Don»)Hey, something happened to the Yellow Moon. 
It rained Moon Stones on Valua. Then there were
some explosions.\e"
M07060012,"\h(«Don»)I want to put my past behind me, but I'm worried
about the Valuans. They're not all bad, you
know.\c"
M07060013,"\h(«Don»)So, this is it, huh?
If we all make it back, we're going to
celebrate!\e"
M07060014,\h(«Don»)I got my bottle of loqua ready!\e
M07060015,"\h(«Don»)Let's get 'em, Vyse!\c"
M08030000,\h(«Urala»)Oh… Vyse. Um… this is a really nice tavern.\e
M08030001,"\h(«Urala»)I wish I could serve Yafutoman food to everyone
on the island…\e"
M08030002,"\h(«Urala»)But, I guess that's impossible without
renovating the kitchen…\e"
M08030003,"\h(«Urala»)Oh, don't worry about it. 
I just miss my kitchen back home.\c"
M08030004,"\h(«Urala»)A lot of the ingredients that I normally use in
Yafutoma are really hard to get over here.\e"
M08030005,"\h(«Urala»)I wanted everyone to get a taste of Yafutoman
food!\e"
M08030006,"\h(«Urala»)But the ingredients are so expensive here…
It will take at least 1,000 gold…\c"
M08030007,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Give Urala 1000 gold.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M08030008,"\h( )You gave 1,000 gold to Urala.\e"
M08030009,\h(«Urala»)Um… Are you sure about this?\e
M08030010,"\h(«Vyse»)Sure, don't worry about it. 
But you'd better make us some really good food!\e"
M08030011,"\h(«Urala»)Thank you very much!
I'll get started right away!\c"
M08030012,"\h(«Urala»)Um… it was nice of you to offer, 
but you don't have enough gold.\c"
M08030013,"\h(«Urala»)I guess I won't be able to make Yafutoman food
for anyone.\c"
M08030014,"\h(«Urala»)Um, Vyse… Thank you very much!
I'll get started right away!\c"
M08030015,"\h(«Urala»)Welcome, what can I do for you?\e"
M08030016,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Have Urala cook some food.”
“Come back some other time.”\e"
M08030017,\h(«Urala»)Um… so you like my cooking?\c
M08030018,"\h(«Urala»)Thank you so much! 
I'll get started right away!\c"
M08030019,"\h(«Urala»)Umm… Polly's a really good cook!
We don't have this kind of food in Yafutoma.\e"
M08030020,"\h(«Urala»)It's a little more filling than what I'm used
to, but I think it's great!.\c"
M08030021,"\h(«Urala»)Umm… I'd be more than happy to make some 
Yafutoman food for you. Stop by later, 
when you get the chance.\c"
M08030100,"\h(«Urala»)Oh… Welcome!
I have been doing my best to cook for the crew!
I hope they like it!\e"
M08030101,"\h(«Urala»)Um… if you like, I could make you lunches that
you could take with you on your travels…\e"
M08030102,"\h(«Urala»)All I need is 10 “Romuhai Fish.” They're a type
of fish that's common back home in Yafutoma…\e"
M08030103,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Have Urala make lunch.”
“Come back some other time.”\e"
M08030104,"\h(«Vyse»)Actually, if it's Romuhai Fish you need, I have
10 right here.\e"
M08030105,"\h(«Urala»)Really? That's great! I can get started right
away!\e"
M08030106,"\h(«Urala»)… Thank you for waiting. I really hope you like
it.\e"
M08030107,"\h(«Urala»)It will heal all of your wounds and replenish
your magic… but takes a little while to start
working, so you can't eat it during a battle.\e"
M08030108,\h( )You received “Urala's Lunch.”\c
M08030109,"\h(«Urala»)Um… I, I'm sorry.
You don't have the 10 Romuhai Fish that I need.
I can't make the dish without them…\c"
M08030110,"\h(«Urala»)If you bring me 10 Romuhai Fish, 
I'll be able to make you something special!\c"
M08030111,"\h(«Urala»)Um… Sorry, but it looks like you still have the
lunch I made for you earlier. It will heal you
all the way, so you don't need more than one.\c"
M08030043,"\h(«Urala»)Um… I heard that Polly own's her own tavern
back in her home town.\e"
M08030044,"\h(«Urala»)Wow… Polly really is something else. I'm glad
she's letting me help out here in her new
tavern!\c"
M08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)This is a very beautiful island that you've 
found, Vyse. This pond reminds me of home. 
It's relaxing.\e"
M08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)I wish that I can just stay here like this 
forever…\c"
M08070002,"\h(«Moegi»)Something seems to be bothering Prince Enrique…
\e"
M08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)I wish he would tell me what it was. Perhaps 
there is something that I could do to calm him
down…\c"
M08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Prince Enrique, I know your decision is final. 
I… I understand your loyalty and love for your
country.\e"
M08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)I cannot stop you. But… please, return safely
to me. I could not bear the pain if something
were to happen to you…\c"
M08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Ever since the island was attacked, I have been
worried about Prince Enrique. 
I hope that he is safe…\e"
M08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)I know that he is strong, but he's all alone. 
I am trying to hope for the best, 
but I fear the worst.\e"
M08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Please, Prince Enrique, please… 
come back to me.\c"
M08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)I have a really bad feeling about that island 
that rose from Deep Sky.\e"
M08070010,\h(«Moegi»)I get the chills just thinking about it.\c
M08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)I thought I heard Prince Enrique scream when the
Moon Stones fell on Valua.
I hope he is safe.\e"
M08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, you believe that Prince Enrique is
safe, right?\c"
M08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)I am so happy that Prince Enrique came back 
safely. I don't know what I would have done if 
something happened to him.\c"
M08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, can you please take me with you 
when you fight against the Armada?\e"
M08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)I don't think I can stand being apart from 
Prince Enrique again… \c"
M08070016,\h(«Moegi»)Perhaps I might be able to help in some way…\e
M08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)Captain, need anything remodeled?
I'd be more than happy to add a little Yafutoman
flavor to our base.\e"
M08150001,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Remodel a building.”
“Decorate the island.”
“Do nothing right now.”\e"
M08150002,"\h(«Kirala»)Way to go! Which building do you want me to
remodel?\e"
M08150003,"\h(«What would you like to remodel?»)“Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”

M08150005,"\h(«What would you like to remodel?»)“Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”
“Tavern…… 1,500 gold.”
“Kalifa's Tent…… 1,000 gold.”\e"
M08150006,"\h(«Kirala»)So, you want me to remodel the living quarters?
It's going to cost you 2,000 gold.
Do you still want me to go through with it?\e"
M08150007,"\h(«Remodel the Living Quarters?»)“Sure, go ahead.”
“Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll have it remodeled 
Yafutoman style by the time you come back to
this island again.\c"
M08150009,"\h(«Kirala»)So, you want me to remodel the tavern?
It's going to cost you 1,500 gold.
Do you still want me to go through with it?\e"
M08150010,"\h(«Remodel the tavern?»)“Yeah, go ahead.”
“Hm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150011,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me! The tavern will be 
remodeled Yafutoman style by the time 
you come back to this island again.\c"
M08150012,"\h(«Kirala»)So, you want me to remodel Kalifa's Tent?
It'll cost you 1,000 gold.
Do you still want me to go through with it?\e"
M08150013,"\h(«Remodel Kalifa's Tent?»)“Yeah, go ahead.”
“Hmm… let me think it over.”\e"
M08150014,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me! Kalifa will have a new tent 
by the time you get back. Maybe she'll actually 
start giving us some useful information.\c"
M08150015,"\h(«Kirala»)Hey, I love decorating! 
What do you want?\e"
M08150016,"\h(«What do you want?»)“I want a fountain in the plaza.”
“I want some fish in the pond.”
“Never mind, I don't want anything decorated.”\e"

“Never mind, I don't want anything decorated.”\e"
M08150023,"\h(«Kirala»)So, shall I put some Taira fish in the pond?
It will cost 500 gold for the fish, though.
Is that alright?\e"
M08150024,"\h(«Do you want some fish in the pond?»)“Yeah, sure!”
“No, never mind.”\e"
M08150025,"\h(«Kirala»)I'll take care of everything! 
You want fish, you'll get fish!\c"
M08150026,"\h(«Kirala»)So you want the plaza fountain remodeled. 
How do you want it done?\e"
M08150027,"\h(«How would you like the fountain done?»)“Natural and elegant…… 500 gold.”
“In praise of the Moons…… 5,000 gold.”
“Never mind.”\e"
M08150028,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me!
I'll make you a magnificent Yafutoman fountain!
\c"
M08150029,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll surprise you!
You'll love it!\c"
M08150030,"\h(«Kirala»)What, you didn't like the fountain?\e"
M08150031,"\h(«Kirala»)So, do you want a fountain built in praise of
the Moons instead? It'll cost you 5,000 gold.
Is that okay?\e"
M08150032,"\h(«Do you want to do this?»)“Sure, remodel the fountain”
“Um… never mind, it's okay”\e"
M08150033,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll surprise you!
It'll be great!\c"
M08150034,"\h(«Kirala»)What, you didn't like the Cupil fountain?\e"
M08150035,"\h(«Kirala»)So, do you want a fountain built with a natural
elegance, instead? It'll cost you 500 gold.
Is that okay?\e"
M08150036,"\h(«Do you want to do this?»)“Sure, remodel the fountain”
“Um… never mind, it's okay”\e"
M08150037,"\h(«Kirala»)Alright! Leave it to me! I'll build a fountain
of natural beauty, just like the fountains we
have back home in Yafutoma!\c"
M08150038,"\h(«Kirala»)Hey, as great as I am, I can't do much without
enough gold. Come back later when you have
enough!\c"
M08150039,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, you're gonna rethink your plans?
Let me know when you decide on what you want.\c"
M08150040,"\h(«Kirala»)Well, to tell you the truth, 
I really like it like that. 
I don't feel like remodeling it.\c"
M08150041,"\h(«Kirala»)Leave it to me! I'll have it finished by the
time you return to the island.\c"
M08150042,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh wait… weren't you already going to have
Izmael remodel that for you?\e"
M08150043,"\h(«Kirala»)If you want, I can remodel it instead.
Is that okay?\e"
M08150044,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Have Izmael remodel it.”
“Have Kirala remodel it.”\e"
M08150045,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that I already asked
Izmael to take care of that.\e"
M08150046,"\h(«Kirala»)Hahaha… it's quite alright.
Well, if you ever want me to remodel it later,
just let me know. I'd be happy to do it.\c"
M08150047,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah… but actually, I was having second
thoughts about the whole thing. I decided that I
want you to remodel it.\e"
M08150048,"\h(«Kirala»)Hahaha… I guess you can't deny true 
craftsmanship, huh? I'll just let Izmael
know and I'll get the money from him.\e"
M08150049,"\h(«Kirala»)Leave everything up to me, okay?
I'll show you the beauty of Yafutoman
architecture!\c"
M08150050,"\h(«Kirala»)The fountain? Well, it looks like ol' Izmael
is taking care of that already. Sorry, but it's
a little late for me to take over the job.\c"
M08150051,"\h(«Kirala»)Well, Izmael has already begun his preparations
for remodeling that. I think it's a little late
for me to do anything about it. Sorry.\c"
M14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)What can I do for ya? 
Need something remodeled?\e"
M14010001,"\h(«What do you want to do?»)“Remodel the buildings.”
“Decorate the island.”
“Never mind.”\e"
M14010002,"\h(«Izmael»)So, ya want me to work on the buildings? 
I'll take care of it for ya! \e"
M14010003,"\h(«What would you like to remodel?»)“Living Quarters…… 2,000 gold.”
“Tavern…… 1,500 gold.”\e"

sure ya want to go through with it?\e"
M14010007,"\h(«Remodel the Living Quarters?»)“Go right ahead.”
“Hmm… let me think this over.”\e"
M14010008,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, leave it to me! You'll love what I'm going
to do to the place! I'll be finished when you
return to the island.\c"
M14010009,"\h(«Izmael»)So, ya want me to remodel the tavern?
It'll cost ya 1,500 gold. 
Is that alright with ya?\e"
M14010010,"\h(«Do you want the tavern remodeled?»)“Yes, please go ahead”
“Hmm… Let me think about it.”\e"

by the time you return to the island.\c"
M14010012,"\h(«Izmael»)So, ya want me to remodel Kalifa's Tent?

How's that sound?\e"
M14010013,"\h(«Remodel Kalifa's Tent?»)“Go right ahead.”
“Hmm… Let me think this over.”\e"
M14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, leave it to me! I'll get the job done 
by the time you come back to this island again.\c"
M14010015,"\h(«Izmael»)So, ya want me to fix up the place, eh? 
Where should I start?\e"
M14010016,"\h(«What do you want him to build?»)“Fountain…… 500 gold.”
“Relief…… 1,000 gold.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M14010017,"\h(«Izmael»)I'll sculpt a relief over the pond. 
What kind do ya want?\e"
M14010018,"\h(«Izmael»)So ya want me to fix up the place?
A builder's work is never done, which
is why I became one in the first place!\e"
M14010019,"\h(«What do you want him to do?»)“Remodel the fountain…… 500 gold.”
“Sculpt a relief…… 1,000 gold.”
“Nothing.”\e"
M14010020,\h(«Izmael»)I'll fix up your fountain… sailor style!\c
M14010021,"\h(«Izmael»)Then I'll sculpt the face of one of ya into the
wall over the pond, so who's face do you want?\e"
M14010022,"\h(«Who's face do you want?»)“I'd like mine sculpted”
“I would prefer Aika's face”
“I would prefer Fina's face”\e"
M14010023,"\h(«Izmael»)You want your face immortalized? Not a problem! 
It would be an honor to sculpt ya. 
I'll make ya look legendary.\c"
M14010024,"\h(«Izmael»)I can sculpt Aika. The hair might be kind of
tough, but I love a challenge!\c"
M14010025,"\h(«Izmael»)I can sculpt Fina. It would be an honor to 
sculpt such a rare beauty!\c"
M14010026,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse, that face is already on the wall! 
Stop and smell the flowers once in a while. 
You're working too hard.\e"
M14010027,"\h(«Izmael»)That's a shame. 
If ya change your mind, gimmie a holler!\c"
M14010028,"\h(«Izmael»)Captain, you don't have enough money. I'd do it 
for free, but I need to buy supplies and stuff. 
Come back when you have the gold.\c"
M14010029,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse, I already remodeled that. 
You shouldn't mess with perfection.\c"
M14010030,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam bam baaam!
Didn't you already ask Kirala to remodel that
building for you?\e"
M14010031,\h(«Izmael»)I could remodel it instead if you want me to!\e
M14010032,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Have Kirala remodel it.”
“Have Izmael remodel it.”\e"
M14010033,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh… I almost forgot that I had asked Kirala to
do it. Sorry about that, Izmael.\e"
M14010034,"\h(«Izmael»)Ba-bam!
Looks like you're getting forgetful in your old
age there! Hahahaha!\e"
M14010035,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, actually, I was thinking about it and I
want you to remodel the building.\e"
M14010036,"\h(«Izmael»)Aye aye!
I'll get to work right away!\e"
M14010037,"\h(«Izmael»)I'll get the money from Kirala. You don't worry
about a thing, okay? Leave everything up to me!
\c"
M14010038,"\h(«Izmael»)It looks like Kirala's already started working
on that. It's a little too late for me to do
anything.\c"
M14010039,"\h(«Izmael»)It looks like Kirala's already started working
on that. It's a little too late for me to do
anything.\c"
M14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)I lost everything that was dear to me… 
I lost it all in the Dark Rift.\e"
M14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)… All I had to keep me going were my memories 
of Polly.\e"
M14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)It was during those years in the Dark Rift that
I realized just how important Polly was to me.\e"
M14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)I never knew how much I had, until she was gone.
I'm gonna stay by her side until we finish this.
Then we're heading back to Sailors' Island.\e"
M14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)I know that I was lost in the Dark Rift for a 
long time, but it's good to know that Polly
hasn't lost her touch in the kitchen.\e"
M14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)The whole time I was marooned, I kept thinking 
about her. Now that I'm back, I'll never take 
her for granted again.\c"
M14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)Captain Vyse. I suppose we will be heading off
to that awful island now…\e"
M14040007,"\h(«Robinson»)We've got to stop Valua from destroying 
everything. Polly and I have our whole lives
ahead of us.\c"
M14040008,"\h(«Robinson»)We have to win this battle! 
I'll do everything I can to help you!\e"
M14040009,"\h(«Robinson»)Captain Vyse, you should sit back and enjoy 
some good food before you set sail again.\e"
M14040010,"\h(«Robinson»)After being marooned for so long, I've really 
learned to appreciate a great meal.\c"
Mp0010000,"\h(«Aika»)Now that we've got our own island base, 
I bet you finally feel like a real captain.
Captain Vyse… I like the sound of that.\e"
Mp0010001,"\h(«Aika»)You've sailed around the world in your own ship!
Not many people can say that they've made their
childhood dreams come true, you know.\e"
Mp0010002,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika, you make it sound like I'm ready to
retire. There's still so much that I haven't
seen yet.\e"
Mp0010003,"\h(«Vyse»)And there's still lots of undiscovered treasure 
to be found. We've got a long way to go!\e"
Mp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)Haha, that's so like you! Don't worry, I'll be
right there with you! Especially, if there's
treasure involved.\c"
Mp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)I'll do my best, Captain Vyse. Haha… 
I like the sound of that. It makes me laugh.\c"
Mp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, now that we can go higher and lower than 
we ever have before, we can explore all of the 
places where we haven't been yet!\c"
Mp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)Brabham should be finished working on the
Delphinus by now!\e"
Mp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Let's hurry back to the port, Vyse!\c"
Mp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)I was going to start calling Enrique 
'Prince Pukey', because he was always 
barfing over the side of the ship…\e"
Mp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)But now, he's become quite a sailor!\e"
Mp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)He'll be okay… right, Vyse…?\c"
Mp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)Haha, that's so like you! Don't worry, I'll be
right there with you! Especially, if there's
treasure involved.\c"
Mp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)I didn't want to believe that my mom and dad 
went to such a horrible place after they died…\e"
Mp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)So, I promised myself that someday, I would
travel to Deep Sky and see it for myself. I
wanted to prove everyone wrong.\c"
Mp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)I hope Fina is ok…
She says she is, 
but she looks really sad… \e"
Mp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)Wasn't Elder Prime like a grandfather to her?
Losing him must have been really hard on her.\c"
Mp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)I never thought Galcian would actually use the
Rains of Destruction!\e"
Mp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)And he did it on his own country, too! 
I can't belive how many people he killed. 
We have to find a way to stop him!\c"
Mp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)So, it all comes down to this battle…
I was so nervous last night that I could barely
sleep.\e"
Mp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)In fact, I was a little scared at first, but
when I thought about all of the Air Pirates that
are here to fight with us, I felt much better.\e"
Mp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)Alright, Vyse, everyone's waiting for us at the
Delphinus! Let's hurry back to the port!\c"
Mp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)Alright, Vyse, everyone's waiting for us at the
Delphinus! Let's hurry back to the port!\c"
Mp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Good morning Vyse!
Thanks for that little talk last night.
I was able to relax enough to get some sleep.\e"
Mp0010027,"\h(«Aika»)I know we can beat Galcian. I have faith in
everyone… And I have faith in you.\e"
Mp0010028,"\h(«Aika»)I'd face anyone if you were fighting by my side.
I'm sure the rest of the Air Pirates feel the
same way.\e"
Mp0010029,"\h(«Aika»)Heh heh… Let's do out best.
Everyone's counting on you, Vy… I mean
Cap'n Vyse!!!\c"
Mp0010030,"\h(«Aika»)Alright, Vyse, everyone's waiting for us at the
Delphinus! Let's hurry back to the port!\c"
Mp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)I thought everything would be over once we 
defeated Galcian, but it looks like I was wrong,
huh?\e"
Mp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)I'm not scared though, since you're here with
me… and we've made it this far together, right?\e"
Mp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)Ok, let's go beat the snot out of Ramirez so we 
can hurry back to Crescent Isle and throw the
biggest party in history!\c"
Mp0020000,"\h(«Fina»)It's… a very nice island. 
And you even had a room made for me, too.\e"
Mp0020001,"\h(«Fina»)I can't believe it… I actually have my own 
room in your home base…\e"
Mp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)I feel like I am really a member of the 
Blue Rogues. I… I'm so happy. 
Thank you, Vyse.\c"
Mp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)When we last saw him, Drachma said that it
wasn't going to be easy for him to start his
life over…\e"
Mp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)Do you think he will rejoin us, 
when he feels better?\c"
Mp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)We've finally gathered all of the Moon Crystals.
My mission is finally over.
Thank you for all your help.\c"
Mp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)We can finally get into Deep Sky? 
I don't know much about it. 
I'm a little scared… \e"
Mp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)I suppose it's time to look for my ship…
Thank you for all you've done for me…\c"
Mp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)So, the Delphinus will be able to sail into
Deep Sky… I never dreamed that I'd have to go
down there.\c"
Mp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique is going back to his homeland, Valua…\e"
Mp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)I, too, must return to my homeland once we find 
my ship. I… I feel almost as if I don't want 
to return.\c"
Mp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)I'm all right. I have decided that I have to 
stop mourning, and start fighting. 
We've got to stop Ramirez!\e"
Mp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez and I… We both were raised by the
Elders in the Great Silver Shrine.\e"
Mp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)Among the Elders, Elder Prime was the most
knowledgable. He knew everything, from 
historical records to current world affairs.\e"
Mp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez was always the most interested in 
Elder Prime's stories about the Chronicles 
of Arcadia. They'd spend hours together.\e"
Mp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)I think it was Elder Prime's stories that
inspired Ramirez to search for the Crystals. 
I can't believe Ramirez… killed him… \c"
Mp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, so many people were killed when the Rains
of Destruction fell on Valua.\e"
Mp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez and the Silver Gigas, Zelos, are
responsible for this.\e"
Mp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)As a Silvite, I… I should have stopped
Ramirez…\c"
Mp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)The time has come at last to face Ramirez.
To be completely honest, it… it's a little hard
for me to fight him.\e"
Mp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)But, as a Silvite… I must stop him. It is my
duty.\e"
Mp0020023,"\h(«Fina»)I'll do my best to fight. We must not let
Galcian and Ramirez destroy this world.\c"
Mp0020024,"\h(«Fina»)Galcian and Ramirez must be stopped, 
before more innocent lives are lost.\c"
Mp0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Good morning, Vyse.
Um… thank you for everything last night.\e"
Mp0020026,"\h(«Fina»)To be completely honest, it's a little hard for
me to fight against Ramirez. But…\e"
Mp0020027,"\h(«Fina»)I want to fight. I want to help save this world.
I… I want to fight along side of you.\e"
Mp0020028,"\h(«Fina»)That's why I'll try my best. As long as you are
there fighting with me, somehow I believe we'll
win.\c"
Mp0020029,"\h(«Fina»)Let's go, Vyse. Everyone is probably waiting at
the Delphinus for us.\c"
Mp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Let's go Vyse, we've got to stop Ramirez.\e"
Mp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)For the sake of this world… and for the memory
of Elder Prime, Ramirez must be stopped.\c"
Mp0040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Oh, hello Vyse. For a hidden base, this is most
impressive.\e"
Mp0040001,"\h(«Enrique»)As we acquire more crew members, the base, as
well as the Delphinus, will run more smoothly.\e"
Mp0040002,"\h(«Enrique»)You are the only one, who has the experience 
and the determination to lead this crew to 
victory. We all look up to you, Vyse!\e"
Mp0040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, I have entrusted you with the 
Delphinus. Please take good care of it,
I may want it back someday.\c"
Mp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)I always wondered when I would return to Valua…
But somehow, this isn't quite what I imagined…\c"
Mp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)We have obtained all the Moon Crystals at last. 
Now I can finally put an end to my mother's
tyranny.\e"
Mp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Although we fight on opposing sides, 
she is still my mother.\e"
Mp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)I hope that I can convince her that what she is 
doing is wrong, and we can come to some
agreement.\c"
Mp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse… I'm sorry, but could you leave me alone
for a while?\c"
Mp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)The modifications on the Delphinus should be
complete. Let us return to the port, Vyse.\c"
Mp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Come now, Vyse. Do not be so worried. I shall
be fine. I do not plan to die just yet. I
still have a country to lead.\e"
Mp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)I… I just have one request to ask of you, Vyse.
Please… look after Princess Moegi while I am
gone. She… she means so much to me.\c"
Mp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)So, it's time to confront Galcian. I shall 
accompany you in the Delphinus.\e"
Mp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Galcian must pay for destroying my 
homeland, and killing my mother… 
and Gregorio…\c"

be at peace. We must win this battle!\e"

will give you an energy boost, but the 
ingredients are hard to find.\e"

what “Mermaid's liver,” “Tsubakurame's Nest,”
and “Winter Insect Summer Grass” are?\e"
M08030026,"\h(«Urala»)If you can find these, I can make you a recipe

MF01000000,"\h(«Polly»)C'est pas trop mal ici. Cela me rappelle un peu
ma taverne sur l'Île des Marins.\e"
MF01000001,\h(«Polly»)Je pense que j'arriverai à cuisiner ici……\e
MF01000002,"\h(«Polly»)Mais, la cuisine a besoin d'être réorganisée,

je pourrai ouvrir une taverne sur votre île.\c"
MF01000004,"\h(«Polly»)Bon maintenant que je peux me servir de la
cuisine, il va me falloir des provisions pour
commencer à cuisiner.\e"
MF01000005,"\h(«Polly»)Humm…… Il me faut 1 000 pièces d'or pour acheter
tout ce dont j'ai besoin.\e"

Je vais tout de suite me mettre au travail !\c"
MF01000009,"\h(«Polly»)Merci pour l'offre, mais vous n'avez pas assez

approvisionnée, je peux cuisiner de bons petits
plats.\e"
MF01000101,"\h(«Polly»)En fait, voulez-vous que je vous prépare quelque
chose à manger pour votre mission ?\e"
MF01000102,"\h(«Polly»)Tous les marins l'appelaient la
“Spécialité de Polly”. Il me faut juste 10
“Grules”. C'est une sorte de poisson volant.\e"

Voilà !\e"
MF01000107,"\h(«Polly»)Cela guérira vos blessures, et vous rendra toute
votre magie, mais cela ne fait pas effet tout de

bataille.\e"

MF01000109,"\h(«Polly»)Désolée, Vyse, mais apparemment vous n'avez pas
assez de Grules. Tant pis. Revenez quand vous en
aurez assez.\c"

MF01000026,"\h(«Polly»)La cuisine Yafutomane est vraiment délicieuse,
elle aussi !\e"
MF01000027,"\h(«Polly»)Je regardais Urala cuisiner tout à l'heure. Elle

Ne vous en faites pas !\c"

Vyse. Je suis vraiment contente d'être venue
avec vous……\c"
MF01000034,"\h(«Polly»)Je vais pouvoir ouvrir ma cuisine d'ici peu.
Ne vous en faites pas !\c"
MF01000043,"\h(«Polly»)Cela fait du bien de s'arrêter un peu de
travailler pour goûter la cuisine d'Urala.
C'est délicieux !\c"
MF01140032,"\h(«Pinta»)D'accord, si je peux en attraper, j'en
rapporterai sur l'Île Croissant, OK ?\c"

C'est un secret. Bon, si c'est uniquement les
animaux qui vous intéressent, je peux en
ramener.\e"
MF01140035,"\h(«Pinta»)Cela coûtera 500 pièces d'or pour leur donner à
manger et tout le reste. Voulez-vous quand même
que j'en capture pour vous ?\e"

“Réflexion faite, laissez tomber.”\e"
MF01140037,"\h(«Vyse»)Des animaux, hein ? Humm…… Ce serait agréable
d'avoir des animaux de compagnie sur l'île. Bon,
pourquoi pas. Allez en chercher quelques-un pour
les mettre sur l'île, OK ?\e"
MF01140038,"\h(«Pinta»)À vos ordres !
Mais d'abord, quels animaux préférez-vous ?\e"
MF01140039,"\h(«Quelle espèce voulez-vous?»)“Un animal adorable venu de l'est.”

animaux pour nous tenir compagnie. Faites-moi
signe si vous changez d'avis, OK ?\c"

capturés pour vous ?\e"

beaucoup. Merci de les avoir capturés Pinta.\e"
MF01140045,"\h(«Pinta»)C'est formidable ! Je suis ravie qu'ils vous
plaisent. Bon, si un jour vous voulez des
animaux d'espèce différente, dites-le moi !\c"
MF01140046,"\h(«Vyse»)J'aime les animaux que vous avez rapportés,
Pinta, mais je me demandais à quoi ressemblaient
les autres……\e"
MF01140047,"\h(«Pinta»)Bon, si vous voulez que je rapporte une autre
espèce animale, cela vous coûtera 500 pièces
d'or.\e"
MF01140048,"\h(«Pinta»)Et si nous mélangeons plusieurs espèces animales
sur l'île, ils risquent de se battre, alors je
vais devoir ramener ceux-là sur leur île, OK ?\e"

discuter souvent avec eux.
Surtout s'ils ont perdu tout espoir.\c"

engagez un “Canonnier” dans votre équipage.\e"
MF04090039,"\h(«Kalifa»)D'un autre côté, si vous voulez augmenter la
puissance de défense de votre navire, vous

quand je ne peux pas danser……\c"
MF05030006,"\h(«Merida»)Je danse en votre honneur ! Je danse pour
célébrer votre prochaine victoire !
Vous serez vainqueur !!\c"
MF05030007,"\h(«Merida»)Kirala m'a donné cette robe. Elle dit que c'est
l'habit traditionnel que les femmes Yafutomanes
portent lors des festivités.\e"
MF05030008,"\h(«Merida»)J'aimerais bien la porter pour danser, mais elle
me gêne pour bouger. Kirala dit qu'il faudrait
500 pièces d'or pour faire des retouches.
Avez-vous assez d'argent ?\e"
MF05030009,"\h(«Merida»)C'est vrai ? Merci beaucoup !
Je vais de ce pas donner l'argent à Kirala !\c"
MF05030010,"\h(«Merida»)Je vous remercie de votre offre, mais c'est
insuffisant……\c"

magnifique……\c"

C'est une danse traditionnelle Yafutomane !
Je l'adore !\c"
MF05100000,"\h(«Hans»)J'apprends tout sur la construction navale avec
Brabham en ce moment.\e"
MF05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Brabham s'y connaît en moteurs,
en modèles anciens et nouveaux, il m'a vraiment
beaucoup appris !\e"
MF05100002,"\h(«Hans»)Il m'a permis de lire le Livre Yafutoman sur les
Polarités.\e"
MF05100003,"\h(«Hans»)J'ai appris à construire un moteur qui avance
grâce au mouvement des vagues et à gréer les
voiles pour que votre navire plane.
J'ai tant appris !\c"
MF05100004,"\h(«Hans»)La construction de ce navire nous a donné
beaucoup de travail. Ce vieux Brabham est une
vraie machine ! Il travaille comme un forcené !\e"
MF05100005,"\h(«Hans»)Toutes ces nuits blanches ont dû l'épuiser,
mais il ne le montre pas. Il est très dynamique,
surtout à son âge !\c"
MF05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Bon, nous avons reconstruit la base, mais il
nous reste à nous préparer pour l'attaque de
l'Armada.\e"
MF05100007,"\h(«Hans»)Avez-vous remarqué la rapidité de certains de
ces navires, et ceux qui peuvent plonger sous
les nuages ?\e"
MF05100008,"\h(«Hans»)Si seulement Valua se servait de sa technologie
avancée pour aider les gens……\c"
MF05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse……
Le moment est venu d'aller se battre……\e"
MF05100010,"\h(«Hans»)Et j'ai reçu des nouvelles de mon père
m'informant que son navire, le Cuirassé, est
prêt à se battre à nos côtés !\e"
MF05100011,"\h(«Hans»)Les préparations sur le Delphinus sont presque
terminées ! L'équipage n'attend plus que vos
ordres !\c"
MF05210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)Hé Capitaine, je peux surveiller l'île toute
entière d'ici.\e"
MF05210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)Rien à signaler aujourd'hui. Euh, à part Izmael
qui a mangé le déjeuner de Brabham quand il
avait le dos tourné.\c"
MF05210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Rien à signaler aujourd'hui. Euh, à part Marco
qui a mal au ventre. Je crois qu'il a bu l'eau
de la mare……\c"
MF05210003,"\h(«Tikatika»)N'allez pas près de la mare. Le Prince
Enrique et la Princesse Moegi se disent adieu
avant de partir. Laissez-les seuls.\c"
MF05210004,"\h(«Tikatika»)Rien à signaler aujourd'hui. Mais, j'ai remarqué
que la Princesse Moegi va à la mare chaque jour
pour prier……\c"
MF05210005,"\h(«Tikatika»)Bienvenue parmi nous, Capitaine. J'essayais de
voir où vous alliez dans ce petit bateau,
mais……\e"
MF05210006,"\h(«Tikatika»)Je n'arrive pas à voir le Temple d'Argent même
avec mes yeux. Il doit être vraiment en
hauteur. Cela me surprend un peu.\e"
MF05210007,"\h(«Tikatika»)Je n'arrive pas à voir d'ici cette île qui a
surgi des nuages…… même avec mes yeux perçants.\e"
MF05210008,"\h(«Tikatika»)Mais, je sens que les oiseaux venus de l'Océan
ont peur. J'ai vraiment un mauvais
pressentiment……\e"

le monde d'ici !\e"
MF05210010,"\h(«Tikatika»)Ils sont tous si dynamiques ! J'arrive à
percevoir leur esprit. Je suis certain que nous
allons gagner la bataille contre l'Armada !\c"
MF07060000,"\h(«Don»)Quand on m'a dit que jadis cette île était
déserte, j'ai pensé que ce serait encore plus
déprimant qu'Esperanza.\e"
MF07060001,"\h(«Don»)Mais, les boissons et la nourriture sont
vraiment variées, et vous avez un équipage
formidable. Vous vous débrouillez vraiment
bien !\c"

MF07060004,"\h(«Don»)Je n'ai jamais goûté la cuisine Yafutomane.

bien longtemps, si j'avais réussi à traverser
le Récif Noir.\e"

Je ne me suis jamais autant amusé qu'en
naviguant avec votre équipage.\c"

réussi à traverser le Récif Noir. Et maintenant
je vais partir naviguer dans les enfers avec
vous.\e"
MF07060007,"\h(«Don»)Vyse, il faut bien le dire, on ne s'ennuie
jamais quand vous êtes là. Vous nous inspirez et
ce n'est rien de le dire !\e"
MF07060008,"\h(«Don»)Nous aurions réussi à traverser le Récif Noir si
vous aviez été avec nous.\c"
MF07060009,"\h(«Don»)Hé, je veux tout savoir sur le Grand Temple
d'Argent !\e"
MF07060010,"\h(«Don»)Pendant que vous étiez parti à l'aventure, moi
je travaillais comme un forcené à tout
reconstruire.\c"
MF07060011,"\h(«Don»)Il est arrivé quelque chose à la Lune Jaune.
Des Pierres de Lune sont tombées sur Valua.
Ensuite nous avons entendu des explosions.\e"
MF07060012,"\h(«Don»)Je veux faire une croix sur mon passé, mais je
m'inquiète pour les Valuans.
Ils ne sont pas tous mauvais, vous savez.\c"
MF07060013,"\h(«Don»)Alors, voilà.
Si nous revenons tous vivants,
il faudra fêter ça !\e"
MF07060014,\h(«Don»)J'ai préparé une bouteille de loqua !\e

tous les habitants de l'île……\e"

que la cuisine ne sera pas rénovée……\e"
MF08030003,"\h(«Urala»)Oh, ne faites pas attention.
Ma cuisine me manque, c'est tout.\c"
MF08030004,"\h(«Urala»)Ici, j'ai du mal à trouver les ingrédients que
j'utilise d'habitude à Yafutoma.\e"
MF08030005,"\h(«Urala»)Je voulais que tout le monde goûte la cuisine
Yafutomane !\e"
MF08030006,"\h(«Urala»)Mais les ingrédients sont très chers ici……

MF08030012,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… C'est gentil de me donner de l'argent,

ma cuisine Yafutomane.\c"

Je m'y mets tout de suite !\c"
MF08030019,"\h(«Urala»)Umm…… Polly est vraiment bonne cuisinière !
Nous n'avons pas ce genre de plats à Yafutoma.\e"
MF08030020,"\h(«Urala»)Je ne mange pas autant d'habitude, mais c'est
délicieux !.\c"
MF08030021,"\h(«Urala»)Umm…… C'est avec grand plaisir que je vous
cuisinerai des plats Yafutomans. Repassez plus
tard quand vous en aurez l'occasion.\c"
MF08030100,"\h(«Urala»)Oh…… Bienvenue !
J'ai cuisiné de mon mieux pour l'équipage !
J'espère que cela va leur plaire !\e"
MF08030101,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… si vous voulez, je peux préparer vos
déjeuners que vous emporteriez pendant vos
voyages……\e"
MF08030102,"\h(«Urala»)Il me faut 10 “Poisson Romuhai.” C'est un
poisson assez courant à Yafutoma……\e"

MF08030104,"\h(«Vyse»)À vrai dire, s'il vous faut du Poisson Romuhai,
j'en ai justement 10.\e"

tout de suite !\e"

plaira.\e"
MF08030107,"\h(«Urala»)Cela guérira toutes vos blessures et régénérera

MF08030109,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… Je, je suis désolée.
Vous n'avez pas les 10 Poissons Romuhais dont
j'ai besoin. Je ne peux pas cuisiner mon

spécialité !\c"
MF08030111,"\h(«Urala»)Um…… Désolée, mais on dirait que vous n'avez pas
encore mangé le déjeuner que je vous ai donné
tout à l'heure. Il vous guérira entièrement,

“Humm…… je vais y réfléchir.”\e"
MF14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, je m'en occupe ! J'aurai terminé la
sculpture dès votre retour sur l'île.\c"
MF14010015,"\h(«Izmael»)Alors, vous voulez que j'arrange tout ça, hein ?
Par où je commence ?\e"
MF14010016,"\h(«Que voulez-vous qu'il construise ?»)“Une fontaine…… 500 pièces d'or.”
“Une sculpture…… 1 000 pièces d'or.”
“Rien.”\e"
MF14010017,"\h(«Izmael»)Je vais faire une sculpture surplombant la mare.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez ?\e"
MF14010018,"\h(«Izmael»)Alors, vous voulez que j'arrange tout ça, hein ?
Un maçon n'a jamais fini son travail, c'est pour
cela que j'ai choisi ce métier !\e"
MF14010019,"\h(«Que voulez-vous qu'il fasse ?»)“Qu'il rénove la fontaine…… 500 pièces d'or.”
“Qu'il fasse une sculpture…… 1 000 pièces d'or.”
“Rien.”\e"
MF14010020,"\h(«Izmael»)Je vais arranger votre fontaine…… façon
marin !\c"
MF14010021,"\h(«Izmael»)Après je sculpterai un de vos visages dans la
falaise surplombant la mare. Alors, par qui je
commence ?\e"
MF14010022,"\h(«Qui voulez-vous que je sculpte ?»)“J'aimerais que vous sculptiez mon visage”
“Je préférerais celui d'Aika”
“Je préférerais celui de Fina”\e"
MF14010023,"\h(«Izmael»)Vous voulez immortaliser votre visage ? Pas de
problème ! Ce serait un honneur de vous
sculpter. Je vous donnerai un air légendaire.\c"
MF14010024,"\h(«Izmael»)Je peux sculpter Aika. Ce sera difficile de
faire ses cheveux mais j'adore les défis !\c"
MF14010025,"\h(«Izmael»)Je peux sculpter Fina. Ce serait un honneur de
sculpter une beauté aussi rare !\c"
MF14010026,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse, ce visage est déjà sur la muraille !
Arrêtez-vous pour sentir les fleurs de temps en
temps. Vous travaillez trop dur.\e"
MF14010027,"\h(«Izmael»)C'est dommage.
Si vous changez d'avis, faites-moi signe !\c"
MF14010028,"\h(«Izmael»)Capitaine, vous n'avez pas assez d'argent. Je le
ferais bien gratuitement, mais je dois acheter
du matériel. Revenez quand vous aurez l'or.\e"
MF14010029,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse, je l'ai déjà rénovée.
Ne touchez pas à la perfection.\c"
MF14010030,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam bam baaam !
Mais vous avez déjà demandé à Kirala de rénover
ce bâtiment pour vous, non ?\e"
MF14010031,"\h(«Izmael»)Je pourrais le rénover à sa place si vous
voulez !\e"
MF14010032,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“Kirala le rénovera.”
“Izmael le rénovera.”\e"
MF14010033,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh, j'ai failli oublier que j'avais demandé à
Kirala de s'en occuper. Je suis désolé Izmael.\e"
MF14010034,"\h(«Izmael»)Ba-bam !
Vous commencez à perdre la mémoire en
vieillissant ! Hahahaha !\e"
MF14010035,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh bien, en fait, j'ai réfléchi et je veux que
ce soit vous qui le rénoviez.\e"
MF14010036,"\h(«Izmael»)À vos ordres !
Je vais me mettre tout de suite au travail !\e"
MF14010037,"\h(«Izmael»)Je demanderai l'argent à Kirala. Ne vous
inquiétez surtout pas. Je m'occupe de tout !\c"
MF14010038,"\h(«Izmael»)On dirait que Kirala s'est déjà mise au travail.
Il est trop tard, je ne peux rien faire.\c"
MF14010039,"\h(«Izmael»)On dirait que Kirala s'est déjà mise au travail.
Il est trop tard, je ne peux rien faire.\c"
MF14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)J'ai perdu tout ce qui m'était cher……
J'ai tout perdu dans le Récif Noir.\e"
MF14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)……Ce sont les souvenirs que j'avais de Polly qui
me donnaient la force de continuer.\e"
MF14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)C'est pendant toutes ces années passées dans le
Récif Noir que j'ai réalisé à quel point Polly
comptait pour moi.\e"
MF14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)Je m'en suis rendu compte seulement après son
départ. Je vais rester à ses côtés jusqu'à ce
que l'on ait terminé. Ensuite nous repartirons
sur l'Île des Marins.\c"
MF14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)Je sais que je suis resté longtemps perdu dans
le Récif Noir, mais c'est bon de savoir que
Polly est toujours aussi bonne cuisinière.\e"
MF14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)Pendant tout ce temps-là, je n'ai pas cessé de
penser à elle. Maintenant que je suis de retour,
je vais lui accorder toute mon attention.\c"
MF14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)Capitaine Vyse…… Je suppose que nous allons
partir sur cette île affreuse……\e"
MF14040007,"\h(«Robinson»)Il faut empêcher Valua de tout détruire.
Polly et moi avons toute la vie devant nous.\c"
MF14040008,"\h(«Robinson»)Il faut gagner cette bataille !
Je vais tout faire pour vous aider !\e"
MF14040009,"\h(«Robinson»)Capitaine Vyse, vous devriez prendre le temps
d'apprécier la bonne chair avant de remettre les
voiles.\e"
MF14040010,"\h(«Robinson»)Après avoir été perdu pendant aussi longtemps,
j'ai appris à apprécier un bon repas.\c"
MFp0010000,"\h(«Aika»)Maintenant que nous avons notre propre base sur
l'île, je parie que tu as vraiment l'impression
d'être capitaine. Capitaine Vyse…… Ça sonne
bien.\e"
MFp0010001,"\h(«Aika»)Tu as fait le tour du monde à bord de ton propre
navire ! Peu de gens peuvent se vanter d'avoir
concrétisé leurs rêves d'enfance, tu sais.\e"
MFp0010002,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika, tu parles comme si j'allais partir à la
retraite. Il me reste tant de choses à voir.\e"
MFp0010003,"\h(«Vyse»)Et il reste plein de trésors à découvrir.
Il nous reste du chemin à faire !\e"
MFp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)Haha, cela ne m'étonne pas de toi !
Ne t'inquiète pas, je serai à tes côtés !
Surtout s'il est question de trésors.\c"
MFp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)Je ferai de mon mieux, Capitaine Vyse. Haha……
Cela me plaît bien. C'est amusant.\c"
MFp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, maintenant que nous pouvons naviguer plus
haut et plus bas que jamais, nous pouvons aller
dans tous les endroits que nous n'avons pas
encore explorés !\c"
MFp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)Brabham devrait avoir terminé son travail sur le
Delphinus !\e"
MFp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Rentrons vite au port, Vyse !\c"
MFp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)J'ai failli appeler Enrique le 'Prince
Vomi' parce qu'il n'arrêtait pas de vomir par-
dessus le pont……\e"
MFp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)Mais maintenant, il est devenu un bon marin !\e"
MFp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)Il s'en sortira…… n'est-ce pas, Vyse……?\c"
MFp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)Haha, cela ne m'étonne pas de toi !
Ne t'inquiète pas, je serai à tes côtés !
Surtout s'il est question de trésors.\c"
MFp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)Je ne voulais pas croire que mon père et ma mère
soient allés dans un endroit aussi horrible
après leur mort……\e"
MFp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)Alors, je me suis promise qu'un jour, j'irai
voir les Profondeurs de mes propres yeux. Je
voulais prouver à tout le monde qu'ils avaient
tort.\c"
MFp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)J'espère que Fina va bien……
Elle dit que oui,
mais elle a l'air vraiment triste……\e"
MFp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)Je crois qu'elle considérait l'Ancien Prime
comme son grand-père. Cela n'a pas dû être
facile pour elle de le perdre.\c"
MFp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)Je ne pensais pas que Galcian ferait pleuvoir
les Pluies de la Destruction un jour !\e"
MFp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)Et sur son propre pays en plus !
Je n'arrive pas à croire qu'il ait tué autant de
gens. Il faut trouver un moyen de l'arrêter !\c"
MFp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Alors tout va se jouer pendant cette bataille……
J'étais vraiment stressée hier soir, et je n'ai
pas beaucoup dormi.\e"
MFp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)Au début, j'avais peur, mais en pensant à tous
ces Pirates de l'Air qui sont venus pour se
battre avec nous, cela m'a rassurée.\e"
MFp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)Allez, Vyse, tout le monde nous attend sur le
Delphinus ! Rentrons vite au port !\c"
MFp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)Allez, Vyse, tout le monde nous attend sur le
Delphinus ! Rentrons vite au port !\c"
MFp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Bonjour, Vyse !
Merci d'avoir discuté avec moi hier soir.
Cela m'a détendu et j'ai réussi à dormir.\e"
MFp0010027,"\h(«Aika»)Je sais que nous pouvons vaincre Galcian.
Je fais confiance à tous les Pirates……
Et je te fais confiance.\e"
MFp0010028,"\h(«Aika»)Je me sens capable de confronter tous nos
ennemis tant que tu es à mes côtés.
Je suis certaine que les autres Pirates de l'Air
pensent la même chose.\e"
MFp0010029,"\h(«Aika»)Faisons de notre mieux.
Tout le monde compte sur toi, Vy…… je veux dire
Cap'taine Vyse !!!\c"
MFp0010030,"\h(«Aika»)Allez, Vyse, tout le monde nous attend sur le
Delphinus ! Rentrons vite au port !\c"
MFp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)Je pensais que tout serait terminé après avoir
vaincu Galcian, mais apparemment j'avais tort,
hein ?\e"
MFp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)Mais je n'ai pas peur puisque tu es là avec
moi…… et nous avons fait tout ce chemin
ensemble, hein ?\e"
MFp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)OK, allons faire la peau à Ramirez pour revenir
au plus vite sur l'Île Croissant, et faire la 
plus grosse fête de tous les temps !\c"
MFp0020000,"\h(«Fina»)C'est…… une très belle île.
Et vous avez même fait construire une chambre
pour moi.\e"
MFp0020001,"\h(«Fina»)Je n'arrive pas à le croire……
J'ai ma propre chambre sur votre base……\e"
MFp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)J'ai vraiment l'impression de faire partie des
Voleurs Bleus maintenant.
Je…… je suis si contente. Merci, Vyse.\e"
MFp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)La dernière fois que nous avons vu Drachma, il a
dit que ce ne serait pas facile de tout
recommencer à zéro……\e"
MFp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)Tu crois qu'il nous rejoindra,
quand ça ira mieux ?\c"
MFp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)Nous avons enfin tous les Cristaux de Lune.
Ma mission est enfin terminée.
Merci de m'avoir aidée.\c"
MFp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)Nous pouvons enfin aller dans les Profondeurs ?
Je ne connais pas bien cet endroit.
J'ai un peu peur……\e"
MFp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)Je suppose que le moment est venu d'aller
chercher mon navire…… Merci de tout ce que vous
avez fait pour moi……\c"
MFp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Donc, le Delphinus pourra naviguer dans les
Profondeurs…… Je ne pensais pas y aller un jour.\c"
MFp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique va retourner dans son pays natal,
Valua……\e"
MFp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Moi aussi je repartirai dans mon pays natal
après avoir retrouvé mon navire. Je…… je n'ai
presque pas envie d'y retourner.\e"
MFp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)Ça va aller. J'ai décidé de ne plus me lamenter
et de commencer à me battre. Il faut arrêter
Ramirez à tout prix !\e"
MFp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez et moi…… Nous avons été élevés par les
Anciens dans le Grand Temple d'Argent.\e"
MFp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)L'Ancien Prime était le plus savant de tous les
Anciens. Il savait tout, de l'histoire à
l'actualité internationale.\e"
MFp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)C'est Ramirez qui s'intéressait toujours le
plus aux histoires de l'Ancien Prime sur les
Chroniques d'Arcadia. Ils passaient des heures
ensemble.\e"
MFp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Je pense que c'est à cause des histoires de
l'Ancien Prime que Ramirez s'est intéressé aux
Cristaux. Je ne peux pas croire que Ramirez……
l'ait tué……\c"
MFp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, il y a eu tellement de morts quand les
Pluies de la Destruction sont tombées sur
Valua.\e"
MFp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)C'est la faute de Ramirez et du Giga d'Argent,
Zelos.\e"
MFp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)En tant que Silvite,
je…… j'aurais dû arrêter Ramirez……\c"
MFp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Le moment est enfin arrivé d'affronter
Ramirez. Pour être franche, cela ne sera pas
facile pour moi de me battre contre lui.\e"
MFp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)Mais, en tant que Silvite…… c'est mon devoir de
l'arrêter.\e"
MFp0020023,"\h(«Fina»)Je ferai de mon mieux. Il faut empêcher
Galcian et Ramirez de détruire le monde.\c"
MFp0020024,"\h(«Fina»)Il faut arrêter Galcian et Ramirez,
avant que d'autres innocents ne périssent.\c"
MFp0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Bonjour, Vyse. Um…… merci de m'avoir remonté le
moral hier soir.\e"
MFp0020026,"\h(«Fina»)Pour être franche, cela ne sera pas facile pour
moi de me battre contre Ramirez. Mais……\e"
MFp0020027,"\h(«Fina»)Je veux me battre. Je veux aider à sauver le
monde. Je…… je veux me battre à vos côtés.\e"
MFp0020028,"\h(«Fina»)Alors je vais faire de mon mieux. Tant que vous
vous battez à mes côtés, je pense que nous
sortirons vainqueurs.\c"
MFp0020029,"\h(«Fina»)Allons-y, Vyse. Tout le monde doit nous attendre
au Delphinus.\c"
MFp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Allons-y Vyse, il faut arrêter Ramirez.\e"
MFp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)Pour l'amour de ce monde…… et à la mémoire de
l'Ancien Prime, Ramirez doit être arrêté.\c"
MFp0040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Bonjour, Vyse. Elle est vraiment impressionnante
pour une base secrète.\e"
MFp0040001,"\h(«Enrique»)Engager d'autres membres d'équipage favorisera
le bon fonctionnement de la base et du
Delphinus.\e"
MFp0040002,"\h(«Enrique»)Vous êtes le seul à avoir l'expérience et la
détermination nécessaires pour nous faire gagner
la bataille. Nous avons tous une grande
admiration pour vous, Vyse !\e"
MFp0040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, je vous ai confié le Delphinus. Prenez-en
soin, je le récupèrerai peut-être un jour.\c"
MFp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Je me suis toujours demandé quand je
retournerais à Valua…… Je ne sais pas pourquoi
mais ce n'est pas ce que j'avais imaginé……\c"
MFp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Nous avons enfin tous les Cristaux de Lune.
Je vais pouvoir mettre fin à la tyrannie de ma
mère.\e"
MFp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Bien que nous soyons ennemis,
c'est quand même ma mère.\e"
MFp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)J'espère arriver à la convaincre qu'elle a tort
d'agir ainsi, et trouver un compromis.\c"
MFp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… Excusez-moi, je voudrais rester seul un
petit instant.\e"
MFp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Les modifications du Delphinus doivent être
terminées. Retournons au port, Vyse.\c"
MFp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Venez, Vyse. Ne vous inquiétez pas autant. Tout
ira bien. Je n'ai pas encore l'intention de
mourir. J'ai un pays à gouverner.\e"
MFp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)J'ai…… j'ai une faveur à vous demander, Vyse.
S'il vous plaît…… veillez sur la Princesse Moegi
pendant mon absence. Elle…… elle compte beaucoup
pour moi.\c"
MFp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Le moment est venu d'affronter Galcian.
Je vais vous accompagner à bord du Delphinus.\e"
MFp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Galcian doit payer pour avoir détruit mon pays
natal, et tué ma mère……
et Gregorio……\c"
MFp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)Voilà…… Si nous sortons vainqueurs, la paix
reviendra dans le monde. Il faut gagner cette
bataille !\e"
MFp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, vous devez nous mener…… nous mener à la
Victoire !\c"
MG01000000,"\h(«Polly»)Gar nicht schlecht hier. Erinnert mich
ein wenig an meine Taverne auf Sailors Island.\e"
MG01000001,"\h(«Polly»)Ich denke schon, dass ich mich hier
zurechtfinde……\e"
MG01000002,"\h(«Polly»)An der Küche könnte man jedoch etwas machen. Sie
müsste etwas umgebaut werden, wenn ich einige
meiner Spezialitäten darin kochen soll.\c"
MG01000003,"\h(«Polly»)Wenn ich ein wenig umbauen darf, dann kann ich
hier auf der Insel eine Taverne eröffnen.\c"
MG01000004,"\h(«Polly»)Jetzt, wo ich eine angemessene Küche habe,
brauche ich nur noch einige Zutaten, um
beginnen zu können.\e"
MG01000005,"\h(«Polly»)Hmm…… ich kann alles, was ich brauche, für
1.000 Goldstücke bekommen.\e"
MG01000006,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Polly 1.000 Goldstücke geben.”
“Im Moment nicht.”\e"
MG01000007,\h( )Du hast Polly 1.000 Goldstücke gegeben.\e
MG01000008,"\h(«Polly»)Danke, Vyse! Du wirst zufrieden sein.
Ich mache gleich alles startklar!\c"
MG01000009,"\h(«Polly»)Danke für das Angebot, aber du hast zur Zeit
nicht genügend Gold. Sobald du das Gold hast,
mach ich mich gleich an die Arbeit.\e"
MG01000010,"\h(«Polly»)Sobald ich die 1.000 Goldstücke erhalten habe,
kann ich mit dem Kochen für euch alle beginnen.
Ich kann's nicht erwarten!\c"
MG01000011,"\h(«Polly»)Wenn ihr später noch mal vorbeikommt,
kann ich euch etwas zu essen anbieten.\c"
MG01000100,"\h(«Polly»)Jetzt, wo es in meiner Küche an nichts mehr
fehlt, kann ich die guten Sachen kochen.\e"
MG01000101,"\h(«Polly»)Möchtet ihr, dass ich etwas koche, das
euch auf eurer Mission helfen kann?\e"
MG01000102,"\h(«Polly»)Die Seeleute nannten es immer das
“Polly Special”. Ich brauche dazu nur 10
“Grules”. Das ist eine besondere Art von
fliegendem Fisch.\e"
MG01000103,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Ein Polly Special bestellen.”
“Ein anderes Mal wiederkommen.”\e"
MG01000104,"\h(«Vyse»)He, hier habe ich gerade 10 Grules.\e"
MG01000105,"\h(«Polly»)Wow, du bist immer auf alles vorbereitet,
nicht wahr, Vyse? Rühr dich nicht vom Fleck,
gleich kommt ein “Polly Special”!\e"
MG01000106,"\h(«Polly»)……Danke, dass du gewartet hast!
Hier, bitte!\e"
MG01000107,"\h(«Polly»)Es wird deine Wunden heilen sowie deine Magie
auffüllen, aber es braucht eine Weile, um zu
wirken, also iss es nicht während einer
Schlacht.\e"
MG01000108,\h( )Du erhieltst “Polly Special” x 1!\c
MG01000109,"\h(«Polly»)Tut mir Leid, Vyse, aber du scheinst nicht
genug Grules zu haben. Das macht aber nichts.
Komm einfach wieder, wenn du sie hast.\c"
MG01000110,"\h(«Polly»)Wenn du mir 10 Grules bringst, mach ich dir
ein “Polly Special”. Das wird dir schmecken!\c"
MG01000111,"\h(«Polly»)Hm? Du hast schon mehr als genug zu essen!
Komm wieder, wenn du aufgegessen hast, was
ich dir bereits gekocht habe.\c"
MG01000023,"\h(«Polly»)Hallo, Vyse. Was kann ich für dich tun?\e"
MG01000024,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Polly etwas zubereiten lassen.”
“Nichts.”\e"
MG01000025,"\h(«Polly»)Du möchtest mal so richtige Seemannskost essen?
Da bist du bei mir richtig!\c"
MG01000026,\h(«Polly»)In Yafutoma kocht man auch sehr gut!\e
MG01000027,"\h(«Polly»)Ich habe vorhin Urala beim Kochen beobachtet.
Sie macht die Brühe für ihre Suppe aus Fisch.
Schmeckt ausgezeichnet!\c"
MG01000028,"\h(«Polly»)In kurzer Zeit werde ich meine Küche eröffnen
können. Mach dir keine Sorgen!\c"
MG01000029,"\h(«Polly»)Hallo, Vyse. Möchtest du etwas?\e"
MG01000030,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Polly etwas zubereiten lassen.”
“Später wiederkommen.”\e"
MG01000031,"\h(«Polly»)Du möchtest mal so richtige Seemannskost essen?
Da bist du bei mir richtig!\c"
MG01000032,"\h(«Polly»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich Robinson
wieder sehen würde.\e"
MG01000033,"\h(«Polly»)Danke für alles, was du für mich getan hast,
Vyse. Ich bin so froh, dass ich mit dir
mitgegangen bin……\c"
MG01000034,"\h(«Polly»)Ich werde meine Küche in kurzer Zeit eröffnen
können. Mach dir also keine Sorgen!\c"
MG01000043,"\h(«Polly»)Es ist schön, mal nicht kochen zu müssen und
Uralas Gerichte zu probieren.
Schmeckt hervorragend!\c"
MG01140032,"\h(«Pinta»)Wenn ich welche fangen kann, bringe ich sie mit
nach Crescent Isle, ok?\c"
MG01140033,"\h(«Pinta»)Ich habe eine Menge Inseln gefunden, auf denen
wirklich interessante Tiere leben!\e"
MG01140034,"\h(«Pinta»)Wo die Insel ist, fragst du? He…… das ist
ein Geheimnis. Wenn du allerdings nur an den
Tieren interessiert bist, kann ich welche für
dich mitbringen.\e"
MG01140035,"\h(«Pinta»)Das Futter für sie kostet 500 Goldstücke.
Soll ich trotzdem welche mitbringen?\e"
MG01140036,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Geh und hole welche für mich, Pinta.”
“Ach nee, lass gut sein.”\e"
MG01140037,"\h(«Vyse»)Einige Tiere? Hmm…… Es wäre ganz schön,
hier einige Haustiere zu haben. Also, warum
nicht. Fang ruhig ein paar für die Insel ein,
ja?\e"
MG01140038,"\h(«Pinta»)Zu Befehl!
Aber was für eine Art von Tier möchtest du?\e"
MG01140039,"\h(«Was für eine Art möchtest du?»)“Etwas Niedliches aus dem Osten.”
“Etwas Buntes aus dem Süden.”
“Etwas Furcht Einflößendes aus dem Westen.”\e"
MG01140040,"\h(«Pinta»)Du hast nicht genug Geld!
Komm einfach wieder, wenn du welches hast,
und ich kümmere mich um alles, ok?\c"
MG01140041,"\h(«Pinta»)Na gut. Ich fände es aber schon schön, wenn wir
hier ein paar Haustiere hätten.
Sag Bescheid, wenn du deine Meinung änderst, ok?\c"
MG01140042,"\h(«Pinta»)He! Magst du die kleinen Tiere, die ich für
dich gefangen habe?\e"
MG01140043,"\h(«Was wirst du Pinta sagen?»)“Sie sind perfekt!”
“Hmm…… ich möchte noch eins sehen.”\e"
MG01140044,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, sie sind perfekt!
Sie gefallen mir sehr. Danke, dass du sie
gefangen hast, Pinta.\e"
MG01140045,"\h(«Pinta»)Toll! Ich freue mich, dass sie dir gefallen.
Falls du irgendwann mal andere Tiere möchtest,
lass es mich wissen!\c"
MG01140046,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich mag die Tiere, die du mitgebracht hast,
Pinta, aber ich frage mich, wie wohl die
anderen Tiere aussahen……\e"
MG01140047,"\h(«Pinta»)Also, wenn ich eine andere Tierart mitbringen
soll, kostet das 500 Goldstücke.\e"
MG01140048,"\h(«Pinta»)Und wenn wir die verschiedenen Tierarten
auf dieser Insel zusammentun, dann bekämpfen
sie sich vielleicht, also werde ich diese Tiere
auf ihre Insel zurückbringen, ok?\e"
MG01140049,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Hm…… Vergiss es.”
“Einverstanden, bring diesmal was anderes mit.”\e"
MG01140050,"\h(«Pinta»)Ok, falls du je andere Tiere haben möchtest,
sag mir Bescheid!\c"
MG01140051,"\h(«Pinta»)Du hast nicht genug Geld!
Komm einfach zurück, wenn du welches hast,
und ich kümmere mich um alles, einverstanden?\c"
MG01140052,"\h(«Vyse»)In Ordnung. Ich verlasse mich auf dich, Pinta.\e"
MG01140053,"\h(«Pinta»)Zu Befehl!
Aber jetzt sag erstmal: Welche Art von Tieren
magst du?\e"
MG01140054,"\h(«Welche Art möchtest du?»)“Etwas Buntes aus dem Süden.”
“Etwas Furcht Einflößendes aus dem Westen.”
“Hm…… Vergiss es.”\e"
MG01140055,"\h(«Welche Art möchtest du?»)“Etwas Niedliches aus dem Osten.”
“Etwas Furcht Einflößendes aus dem Westen.”
“Hm…… Vergiss es.”\e"
MG01140056,"\h(«Welche Art möchtest du?»)“Etwas Niedliches aus dem Osten.”
“Etwas Furcht Einflößendes aus dem Westen.”
“Hm…… Vergiss es.”\e"
MG01140057,"\h(«Pinta»)Ok, wenn du irgendwann mal andere Tiere
möchtest, sag mir einfach Bescheid!\c"
MG01140058,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich denke, ich bleibe bei den Niedlichen.
Sonst fängt Aika noch an, sich zu beschweren.\e"
MG01140059,"\h(«Pinta»)Aye aye, Captain!
Ich geh gleich welche fangen!\e"
MG01140060,"\h(«Vyse»)Also, ich glaube, wir könnten hier etwas
Farbe gebrauchen. Bring mir doch bitte ein paar
farbige Tierchen, ja?\e"
MG01140061,"\h(«Pinta»)Aye aye, Captain!
Ich geh gleich welche fangen!\e"
MG01140062,"\h(«Vyse»)He…… da wir nun mal Luftpiraten sind, sollten
wir vielleicht auch ein paar Furcht einflößende
Haustiere haben.\e"
MG01140063,"\h(«Pinta»)Zu Befehl!
Ich geh gleich welche fangen!\e"
MG02000000,"\h(«Marco»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich je aus Valua
herauskomme. Und ich wusste auch nicht, dass
die Welt da draußen so groß ist!\e"
MG02000001,"\h(«Marco»)Nachdem du mir so eingängig davon berichtet
hast, wollte ich so viel wie möglich von der
Welt sehen. Danke, Vyse! Ich kann's kaum
erwarten, wieder auf Reisen zu gehen!\c"
MG02000002,"\h(«Marco»)He…… für mich war die größte Überraschung,
nachdem ich aus Valua entflohen war,
wahrscheinlich der Himmel…… er ist blau.
Ich habe noch nie zuvor blauen Himmel gesehen……\e"
MG02000003,"\h(«Marco»)Und die Wolken sind weiß! Ich dachte, sie
wären alle so dunkel wie in Valua!\e"
MG02000004,"\h(«Marco»)He, lacht nicht! Wenn ihr euer ganzes Leben
in Lower City verbracht hättet, würdet ihr
mich verstehen!\c"
MG02000005,"\h(«Marco»)Also, wie steht's mit dem neuen Schiffsmotor?\e"
MG02000006,"\h(«Marco»)He…… wer hätte gedacht, dass ich Ingenieur
werden würde…… Ich habe dabei geholfen, dieses
Ding zu bauen! Keine schlechte Leistung, das
muss man sagen.\c"
MG02000007,"\h(«Marco»)Da bist du ja wieder, Vyse! Ich wette, es
hat dich überrascht, die Insel in diesem
tollen Zustand vorzufinden, oder?\e"
MG02000008,"\h(«Marco»)Ich habe Izmael ziemlich viel dabei geholfen!
Na ja…… ich hab zwar nur die Wände gestrichen,
aber es war trotzdem eine Menge Arbeit!\c"
MG02000009,"\h(«Marco»)He, ihr habt doch die Sternschnuppen gesehen,
die über Valua vom Himmel gefallen sind, nicht?\e"
MG02000010,"\h(«Marco»)Seitdem das passiert ist, sehen du und Aika
sehr besorgt aus. Was ist los? Ist etwas
Schlimmes passiert?\c"
MG02000011,"\h(«Marco»)Die Armada hat die Moon Stones auf Valua
niederregnen lassen, nicht?\e"
MG02000012,"\h(«Marco»)Ich…… ich habe diesen Ort niemals richtig
gemocht, aber…… ich bin dort aufgewachsen.
Es macht mich traurig, dass jetzt nichts
mehr davon übrig ist.\e"
MG02000013,"\h(«Marco»)Vyse, versprich mir, dass wir die Armada
besiegen werden. Das können wir nicht
durchgehen lassen.\c"
MG02000014,"\h(«Marco»)Wir müssen sie stoppen, bevor sie alle anderen
Länder zerstören. Es gibt so vieles, was ich
noch nicht gesehen habe.\c"
MG04090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Willkommen. Höre meine Worte, und der Weg
des Lichts wird sich dir offenbaren……\e"
MG04090001,"\h(«Wirst du dir die Zukunft voraussagen lassen?»)“Zahle 10 Goldstücke für die Voraussage.”
“Vielleicht ein anderes Mal.”\e"
MG04090002,"\h(«Kalifa»)Denk an meine Worte und nimm sie
dir zu Herzen. Jetzt geh und trete deinem
Schicksal entgegen.\e"
MG04090003,"\h(«Kalifa»)Eine Sache noch…… der Red Moon benötigt ein
besseres Zelt, um seine Weisheit korrekt auf
mich übertragen zu können. Ich kann unter
diesen…… Umständen nicht arbeiten.\c"
MG04090004,"\h(«Kalifa»)Willkommen. Höre meine Worte, und die Zukunft
wird sich dir eröffnen……\e"
MG04090005,"\h(«Wirst du dir deine Zukunft voraussagen lassen?»)“Zahle 10 Goldstücke für die Voraussage.”
“Zahle 100 Goldstücke für die Voraussage.”

des Lichts wird sich dir offenbaren……\e"

“Zahle 100 Goldstücke für die Voraussage.”
“Vielleicht ein anderes Mal.”\e"
MG04090008,\h( )Du hast Kalifa 10 Goldstücke gegeben.\e
MG04090009,"\h(«Kalifa»)Nun gut.
Lass und beginnen.\c"
MG04090010,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm……\e
MG04090011,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa!!!\e
MG04090012,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Denk daran, du musst
dein Essen gut kauen, bevor du es
herunterschluckst!\e"
MG04090013,"\h(«Kalifa»)Auf diese Weise erstickst du nicht daran,
und es hilft auch der Verdauung.\c"
MG04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Ein niedriger
“Verwegenheitswert” wird sich auf deine Mission
auswirken!\e"
MG04090015,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du einen geringen Wert hast, wird es
einfacher, aus Kämpfen wegzurennen oder sie
ganz und gar zu vermeiden!\c"
MG04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Hmm…… sieht so aus,
als wäre es morgen teils heiter, teils bewölkt
mit vereinzeltem Regen.\e"
MG04090017,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du also draußen Wäsche aufgehängt hast,
holst du sie besser heute noch rein!\c"
MG04090018,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Ein hoher
“Verwegenheitswert” beeinflusst die Moral der
Mannschaft auf positive Weise.\e"
MG04090019,"\h(«Kalifa»)Deine Tapferkeit wirkt sich auch im Kampf aus!
Deine Kampfkraft wird je nach deinen
Führungsqualitäten ansteigen!\c"
MG04090020,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Auf…… Pirate Isle……
das kleine Mädchen mit Namen Lindsi…… o nein!
Sie wird am Anlegeplatz spielen und…… und……\e"
MG04090021,"\h(«Kalifa»)……und wird einen Splitter in den Finger
bekommen!\c"
MG04090022,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Eine Frau von einer
Taverne und ein Mann, der schweigend für sich
allein dasitzt, werden wieder vereint!\e"
MG04090023,"\h(«Kalifa»)Und wenn sie erst einmal wieder als Mann und
Frau vereint sind, leben sie glücklich bis
ans Ende ihrer Tage. Was für ein schönes
Ende……\c"
MG04090024,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Deine Glückszahl ist
81. Deine Glücksfarbe ist Weiß.\e"
MG04090025,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ehepaare sollten mehr Zeit an der Luft
verbringen! Draußen ist es romantischer……\c"
MG04090026,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Auf Sailors Island
gibt es einige seltene Objekte zu verkaufen.\e"
MG04090027,"\h(«Kalifa»)Also sollte man so oft wie möglich
vorbeischauen, um zu sehen, was für neue
Waren der Händler hat!\c"
MG04090028,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Während deiner Reisen
wirst du viele Leute treffen. Du wirst
dich auch von vielen Leuten trennen……\e"
MG04090029,"\h(«Kalifa»)……Was? Du meinst, das könnte auf jeden
zutreffen?! Du Skeptiker! Du musst lernen, dein
eigenes Schicksal zu akzeptieren. Dann wirst du
deine wahre Bestimmung erfahren.\c"
MG04090030,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! In dieser Welt gibt
es 3 besondere Chams, “Abirik-Chams” genannt.\e"
MG04090031,"\h(«Kalifa»)Man weiß nie, woher sie kommen, also sei nett zu
den Leuten…… vielleicht überraschen sie dich mit
einem Geschenk.\c"
MG04090032,"\h(«Kalifa»)Abwehrtechniken dauern nur eine Runde lang an,
aber ihre Wirkung ist garantiert.\e"
MG04090033,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du also die Schritte deines Feindes
voraussagen kannst, wirst du in der Lage sein,
seine Angriffe zu unterbinden.\c"
MG04090034,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du erst einmal
Kapitän deines eigenen Schiffes bist und deine
Spirits so hoch wie möglich sind……\e"
MG04090035,"\h(«Kalifa»)……wirst du die Macht erlangen, alle deine
Verbündeten mit zu dir in den Kampf zu
rufen.\c"
MG04090036,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Deine Mannschaft
wird unterschiedlich reagieren, je nach dem
Zustand deines Schiffes.\e"
MG04090037,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du eine eigene Mannschaft hast, sprich
oft mit ihr. Vor allem, wenn alles verloren
scheint.\c"
MG04090038,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du deine Kanonen
effektiver einsetzen möchtest, such nach einem
“Kanonier” für deine Mannschaft.\e"
MG04090039,"\h(«Kalifa»)Möchtest du andererseits die Abwehrkraft deines
Schiffes erhöhen, solltest du einen “Ingenieur”
finden, der bei der Wartung hilft.\c"
MG04090040,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Prinzessin Moegi wird
sich verlieben. Aber diese Liebe wird ihr
großen Schmerz bereiten.\e"
MG04090041,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ich…… ich kann nichts mehr sehen. Die Zukunft
ist in der Schwebe. Du musst stark sein, denn
das Schicksal der Welt lastet auf deinen
Schultern.\c"
MG04090042,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du dich stets
im Kampf bewährst, wird sich die Kunde von
deiner Tapferkeit verbreiten.\e"
MG04090043,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du andererseits immer vor deinen Gegnern
wegläufst, wird man dich für feige halten.
Sei vorsichtig bei allem, was du tust.\c"
MG04090044,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wird ein Moon Stone
verunreinigt, wird er zu einem “Chom”.
Diese haben die gegenteilige Wirkung von
“Chams.”\e"
MG04090045,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn man Cupil einen Chom gibt, wird er alle
Chams erbrechen, die er bis zu diesem
Zeitpunkt gegessen hat. Setze sie mit
Vorsicht ein.\c"
MG04090046,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Heute Abend darfst
du auf keinen Fall Fisch essen!\e"
MG04090047,"\h(«Kalifa»)Denn sonst verdirbst du dir den Magen, und dir
wird dermaßen schlecht, viel schlechter, als
wenn du mit einem Schiff fliegst.\c"
MG04090048,\h(«Kalifa»)……Nichts. Ich sehe nichts.\e
MG04090049,"\h(«Kalifa»)Nun, betrachte das Gold, das du ausgegeben hast
einfach als Investition in die Zukunft.\c"
MG04090050,\h(«Kalifa»)……Nichts. Ich sehe nichts.\e
MG04090051,"\h(«Kalifa»)Nun, betrachte das Gold, das du ausgegeben hast,
einfach als Investition in die Zukunft.\c"
MG04090052,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!\e"
MG04090053,"\h(«Kalifa»)Alte Weisheiten werden vom Gefühl eines jungen
Herzens widerlegt.\c"
MG04090054,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Ich sehe große Gefahr in deiner nahen Zukunft!\e"
MG04090055,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ein großes Unglück kann viele Formen annehmen,
aber in Wirklichkeit…… hat es keine.
Das ist alles, was ich im Moment sagen kann.\c"
MG04090056,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Aber es ist verschwommen…… Vielleicht reichen
10 Goldstücke, um die Sache etwas klarer
erscheinen zu lassen!\e"
MG04090057,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wahrsager müssen schließlich auch etwas essen,
meinst du nicht?\c"
MG04090058,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Ich sehe einen Moon Stone! Aber seine Farbe
ist……\e"
MG04090059,"\h(«Kalifa»)……schwer zu erkennen. Er ist nicht rot. Und
lila, blau oder grün ist er auch nicht. Gelb
oder silber auch nicht. Es ist eine Farbe,
die ich noch nie vorher gesehen habe.\c"
MG04090060,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!\e"
MG04090061,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hinter Deep Sky verbirgt sich mehr, als man
denkt! Sei vorsichtig, Vyse, denn unter den
Wolken lauert das Böse.\c"
MG04090072,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Red Moon hat gesprochen. Denk immer an
meine Worte. Nun geh und erfülle dein
Schicksal.\c"
MG04090073,\h( )Du hast Kalifa 100 Goldstücke gegeben.\e
MG04090074,"\h(«Kalifa»)Nun gut.
Fangen wir an.\c"
MG04090075,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm……\e
MG04090076,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa!!!\e
MG04090077,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Irgendwo über dem
Himmel von Valua lebt ein Mann, der Studien
treibt, um die Welt zu verbessern.\e"
MG04090078,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn ihr diesem Mann die Weisheit in euren
Seelen offenbart, wird er sich vielleicht
anschließen und eure Sache unterstützen.\c"
MG04090079,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Irgendwo in den Ländern
des Ostens gibt es eine Insel, die von
seltsamen kleinen Wesen bewohnt ist.\e"
MG04090080,"\h(«Kalifa»)Suche nördlich des großen Bergs nach dieser
Insel. Vielleicht findest du dort etwas
Nützliches.\c"
MG04090081,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Irgendwo in dem
dunklen Sturm gibt es merkwürdige Felsen,
die ein schwarzes Licht ausstrahlen.\e"
MG04090082,"\h(«Kalifa»)Vielleicht sind diese Felsen ein Fenster zur
Vergangenheit und künden von zahllosen
Tragödien aus alter Zeit.\c"
MG04090083,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Irgendwo unterhalb der
Wolken des dunklen Sturms gibt es eine Fischart,
die über Jahrhunderte hindurch unverändert
geblieben ist.\e"
MG04090084,"\h(«Kalifa»)Vielleicht können dir diese Fische irgendwie
nützlich sein. Geh und suche nach ihnen.\c"
MG04090085,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Nördlich von
Yafutoma lebt ein Mann, in dessen Seele das
Feuer seiner Schmiede brennt.\e"
MG04090086,"\h(«Kalifa»)Er ist ein stolzer alter Mann. Erwarte nicht,
dass er dir behilflich ist, es sei denn, du
erachtest dich tatsächlich seines Handwerks für
würdig.\c"
MG04090087,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Irgendwo im Himmel
über der Wüste gibt es einen kalten, erloschenen
Stern aus Metall.\e"
MG04090088,"\h(«Kalifa»)Die Leute aus der Alten Welt haben diesen Stern
mit eigenen Händen angefertigt. Welchem Zweck
er diente, ist selbst mir nicht bekannt.\c"
MG04090089,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Südlich der bewaldeten
Inseln gibt es ein Lebewesen, das fortwährend
gen Himmel schaut.\e"
MG04090090,"\h(«Kalifa»)Suche nahe der Insel, die von Felsklippen
unterteilt wird. Vielleicht findest du dort,
was du suchst.\c"
MG04090091,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Südlich der bewaldeten
Inseln gibt es ein Lebewesen, das fortwährend
gen Himmel schaut.\e"
MG04090092,"\h(«Kalifa»)Suche nahe der Insel, die von Felsklippen
unterteilt wird. Vielleicht findest du dort,
was du suchst.\c"
MG04090093,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Der Mann, der
ausschließlich nach  Essen sucht, kann dir bei
deiner Suche nach exotischen Zutaten helfen.\e"
MG04090094,"\h(«Kalifa»)Es hat den Anschein, als sei er selbst einmal
ein Luftpirat gewesen. Geh und suche nach ihm.\c"
MG04090095,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! An deinem Geburtsort……
im Arbeitszimmer deines Vaters…… ist ein
geheimer Durchgang hinter dem Bücherregal.\e"
MG04090096,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du ihn bisher noch nicht gefunden hast,
dann bedeutet das, dass du kein guter
Schatzjäger bist, nehme ich an.\c"
MG04090097,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Aika…… dein geheimes
Goldversteck ist……\e"
MG04090098,"\h(«Aika»)He! Das brauchst du nicht jedem unter die
Nase zu binden! Wozu hat man denn ein
Geheimversteck, wenn du gleich jedem erzählst,
wo es ist?!\c"
MG04090099,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Es gibt einen Ort,
auf den die Monde ihre Schatten werfen.\e"
MG04090100,"\h(«Kalifa»)Er liegt hoch oben über den Wolken. Du weißt,
dass du am Ziel bist, wenn alles um dich herum
dunkel wird.\c"
MG04090101,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Red Moon spricht!!
Über dem Sturm des Dämonen
befindet sich eine einsame Insel.\e"
MG04090102,"\h(«Kalifa»)Es ist ein geheimnisvoller Ort…… Er wird von
seltsamen, vogelähnlichen Kreaturen bewohnt, die
tanzen und fröhlich herumtollen. Du musst diesen
Ort finden.\c"
MG04090103,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Hoch über dem Himmel
von Ixa'taka steht ein Gebäude altertümlicher
Bauart!\e"
MG04090104,"\h(«Kalifa»)Die Leute der Alten Welt haben mit ihrer
Technologie und Macht Wunder bewirkt.
Vielleicht können wir alle von ihren Erfolgen……
und ihren Mißerfolgen lernen.\c"
MG04090105,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! In der Stadt inmitten
der Wälder gibt es eine Frau, die allen Rache
schwört, die ihr Unrecht getan haben.\e"
MG04090106,"\h(«Kalifa»)Sie wartet auf die Erfüllung ihrer Hoffnung.
Du wirst ihr aber beweisen müssen, dass du ihr
helfen kannst.\c"
MG04090107,"\h(«Kalifa»)……Ich sehe nichts.
Komm ein anderes Mal wieder.
Ich muss mich ausruhen.\e"
MG04090108,"\h(«Kalifa»)Kann man mir das vorwerfen? Es ist unmöglich,
die ganze Zeit zu arbeiten. Ich nehme an,
sogar du, der große Vyse, musst ab und zu
einmal kürzer treten, nicht wahr?\c"
MG04090109,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Irgendwo über den
Wolken irrt ein Schiff ohne Besatzung
ziellos durch den Himmel.\e"
MG04090110,"\h(«Kalifa»)Unterhalb des Schiffes…… sehe ich nichts als
Dunkelheit. Vielleicht solltest du es irgendwo
oberhalb der Dark Rift versuchen.\c"
MG04090111,"\h(«Kalifa»)Du hast irgendwo eine einzelne Münze mit einer
Inschrift gefunden.\e"
MG04090112,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Gildenvorsteher in Nasrad sucht schon
lange nach einer solchen Münze. Es ist möglich,
dass er bereit ist, gut dafür zu bezahlen.\c"
MG04090113,"\h(«Kalifa»)Meine Fähigkeiten erstrecken sich nicht nur
auf die Hellseherei. Nimm mich ab und zu mal
mit auf dein Schiff.\e"
MG04090114,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du eine Schiffsschlacht mit mir an Bord
gewinnst, werde ich seltene Objekte für dich
finden…… wenn ich der Ansicht bin, dass du
ihrer würdig bist.\c"
MG04090115,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! In den Ruinen von
Nasrad gibt es eine ehemals stolze Frau, die
inmitten der Asche ihres Ladens sitzt.\e"
MG04090116,"\h(«Kalifa»)Vielleicht könnte sie eurer Crew nützlich sein.
Sie kennt sich aus, wo man seltene und
ungewöhnliche Objekte nach Schiffsschlachten
findet.\c"
MG04090117,"\h(«Kalifa»)……Ich sehe nichts.

Lass uns beginnen.\c"
MG04090140,\h(«Kalifa»)Hmmm……\e
MG04090141,\h(«Kalifa»)Haaaa!!!\e
MG04090142,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! In dieser Welt gibt
es Monster, die man nicht mit einem Schwert
besiegen kann. Diese riesigen Biester muss
man mit einem Schiff angreifen.\e"
MG04090143,"\h(«Kalifa»)Eines davon lebt in den Lands of Ice.
Es scheint so eine Art Rieseninsekt zu sein……\c"
MG04090144,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Red Moon hat mir eine Vision geschickt!
Du musst den Vogel des Doktors mit 
unsichtbarem Fisch füttern.\e"
MG04090145,"\h(«Kalifa»)Für deine Großzügigkeit sollst du belohnt wer-
den, denn dieser Vogel birgt Schätze, die du 
noch nie zuvor gesehen hast. Das ist alles.\c"
MG04090146,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Während deines
Abenteuers wirst du den Schatzräuber Zivilyn
Bane achtmal treffen.\e"
MG04090147,"\h(«Kalifa»)Er sucht nur nach legendären Schätzen. Wenn
du ihn triffst, kannst du getrost sein, dass
du in der Nähe einen wertvollen Schatz finden
wirst.\c"
MG04090148,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du etwas Geld
sparen willst, solltest du gegen viele Kanezls
antreten.\e"
MG04090149,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der “goldene Pollen” dieser Kreaturen erbringt
einen hohen Preis auf dem Markt. Wenn du etwas
davon in deinen Besitz bekommst, verkaufe
es sofort.\c"

schweigt.\e"

anderen Tag wiederkommen. Deine 100 Goldstücke
werde ich behalten, um meine Gedanken zu
ordnen……\c"
MG04090152,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Die Materialien, die
zum Anfertigen eines hervorragenden Schwerts
notwendig sind, liegen tief unterhalb der
Wolken.\e"
MG04090153,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du diese Materialien der richtigen Person
gibst, wird sie für dich ein Schwert anfertigen,
das wie kein anderes auf der Welt ist.\c"
MG04090154,"\h(«Kalifa»)Es gibt ein Objekt, das “Weiße Karte” genannt
wird. Es enthüllt die Pfade der Feinde und
verringert damit mögliche Zusammenstöße
mit Angreifern.\e"
MG04090155,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du es bei dir trägst, kommst
du unverwundet durch die schlimmsten

MG04090157,"\h(«Kalifa»)Einer ist irgendwo in den Himmeln von Ixa'taka,
ein anderer irgendwo in Esperanza, und der
letzte ist in Nasrad. Findet heraus, wer sie
besitzt!\c"
MG04090158,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Der rote Zauber
“Increm” kann auch dazu verwendet werden, die
Angriffskraft deiner Schiffskanonen zu
verstärken!\e"
MG04090159,"\h(«Kalifa»)Benutze ihn so oft wie möglich zu deinem
Vorteil.\c"
MG04090160,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Dein Schiff hat ein
Attribut namens “Wert”.\e"
MG04090161,"\h(«Kalifa»)Abhängig davon, mit welchen Teilen du dein
Schiff ausgerüstet hast, wird er steigen oder
fallen, aber er hat keine Auswirkung auf die
Stärke deines Schiffes.\c"
MG04090162,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du Verbindung mit
der “anderen Welt” aufnimmst, wird ein
riesiges Monster erscheinen!\e"
MG04090163,"\h(«Kalifa»)Es wird viel größer sein als das, dem du schon
mehrere Male begegnet bist.
Wirst du in der Lage sein, es zu besiegen?\c"
MG04090164,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Von Zeit zu Zeit
wird Cupil sehr hungrig werden und sich
seltsam benehmen.\e"
MG04090165,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn man ihm zu diesem Zeitpunkt einen Abirik
Cham gibt, wird er sich auf eine Art und Weise
verändern, wie man es sonst nicht sieht.\c"
MG04090166,"\h(«Kalifa»)Eine Vision vom Red Moon! Suche deine Spie-
gelbilder. Wenn du dich selbst im Kampf  
schlagen kannst, wirst du Waffen mit hoher 
Schusskraft erhalten.\e"
MG04090167,"\h(«Kalifa»)Hm…… Irgendetwas stimmt mit diesen 
Waffen nicht…… An dieser ganzen Sache 
muss etwas faul sein……\c"
MG04090168,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! In dieser Welt gibt
es 30 Chams.\e"
MG04090169,"\h(«Kalifa»)Geh und finde sie alle. Vielleicht wird
es dir gelingen, Cupil so großzuziehen, dass
er seine wahre Form erreicht.\c"
MG04090170,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Du weißt sicher,
dass einige Monster Objekte mit sich tragen.\e"
MG04090171,"\h(«Kalifa»)Manchmal tragen diese Monster äußerst seltene
Objekte mit sich herum, die sonst in keinem
Laden zu finden sind.\c"
MG04090172,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas!
Gelegentlich wirst du einen mysteriösen
reisenden Händler treffen.\e"
MG04090173,"\h(«Kalifa»)Dieser Händler reist um die Welt und sammelt
seltene und ungewöhnliche Objekte, die sonst
nirgendwo erhältlich sind!\c"
MG04090174,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Die Geschwindigkeit
spielt bei Schiffsschlachten eine wichtige
Rolle.\e"
MG04090175,"\h(«Kalifa»)Wenn du ein schnelles Schiff hast, hast du
die Möglichkeit, als Erster anzugreifen, und
deine Kanonen haben eine höhere
Trefferwahrscheinlichkeit.\c"
MG04090176,"\h(«Kalifa»)……Hmm. Nichts. Mein Moon Stone reagiert gar
nicht auf mich.\e"
MG04090177,"\h(«Kalifa»)Tut mir Leid, aber du musst ein anderes Mal
wiederkommen. Ich kann nichts sehen, wenn mein
Moon Stone nicht richtig reagiert.\c"
MG04090178,"\h(«Kalifa»)In dieser Welt gibt es ein Objekt, das
“Schwarze Karte” genannt wird.\e"
MG04090179,"\h(«Kalifa»)Es erhöht die Angriffslust desjenigen, der
es trägt und verwickelt ihn in mehr Kämpfe als
gewöhnlich. Es hat seinen Nutzen……\c"
MG04090180,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Gelegentlich wird
Cupil sehr hungrig werden und sich seltsam
benehmen.\e"

MG04090194,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Red Moon hat mir eine Vision geschickt!
Du musst den Vogel des Doktors mit 
unsichtbarem Fisch füttern.\e"
MG04090195,"\h(«Kalifa»)Für deine Großzügigkeit sollst du belohnt wer-
den, denn dieser Vogel birgt Schätze, die du 
noch nie zuvor gesehen hast. Das ist alles.\c"
MG04090196,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Während deines
Abenteuers wirst du den Schatzräuber Zivilyn
Bane achtmal treffen.\e"
MG04090197,"\h(«Kalifa»)Er sucht nur nach legendären Schätzen. Wenn
du ihn triffst, kannst du getrost sein, dass
du in der Nähe einen wertvollen Schatz finden
wirst.\c"
MG04090198,"\h(«Kalifa»)Ja, ja! Ich sehe etwas! Wenn du etwas Geld
sparen willst, solltest du gegen viele Kanezls
antreten.\e"
MG04090199,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der “goldene Pollen” dieser Kreaturen erbringt
einen hohen Preis auf dem Markt. Wenn du etwas
davon in deinen Besitz bekommst, verkaufe
es sofort.\c"
MG04090200,"\h(«Kalifa»)……Die Zukunft ist ungewiss. Der Red Moon
schweigt.\e"
MG04090201,"\h(«Kalifa»)Tut mir Leid, vielleicht könntest du an einem
anderen Tag wiederkommen. Deine 100 Goldstücke
werde ich behalten, um meine Gedanken zu
ordnen……\c"
MG04090202,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Red Moon hat gesprochen. Erinnere dich
seiner Worte, und der Weg wird dir
offen stehen.\c"
MG04090203,"\h(«Kalifa»)Du hast anscheinend nicht genug Gold.
Der Red Moon arbeitet nicht umsonst.
Komm ein anderes Mal wieder.\e"
MG04090204,"\h(«Kalifa»)Also gut. Ich verstehe.
Wenn du einmal den Rat des Red Moon brauchen
solltest, komm zu mir zurück.\c"
MG04090205,"\h(«Kalifa»)Der Red Moon hat gesprochen.
Denk an meine Worte und befolge sie.
Nun trete deinem Schicksal entgegen.\c"
MG05030000,"\h(«Merida»)Izmael hat versprochen, dass er mir eine
Bühne baut, auf der ich tanzen kann, aber er
hat nicht genug Geld dafür.\e"
MG05030001,"\h(«Merida»)Hast du mehr Geld? Izmael hat gesagt, es
kostet 500 Goldstücke, die Bühne zu bauen.\e"
MG05030002,"\h(«Was wirst du tun»)“Die 500 Goldstücke bezahlen.”
“Nichts.”\e"
MG05030003,"\h(«Merida»)Wirklich? Du willst die neue Bühne bezahlen?
Danke! Ich werde es gleich Izmael sagen!\c"
MG05030004,"\h(«Merida»)Ich freue mich über dein Angebot, aber du hast
nicht genug Geld……\c"
MG05030005,"\h(«Merida»)Tanzen ist mein Leben. Es stimmt mich traurig,
wenn ich nicht tanzen kann……\c"
MG05030006,"\h(«Merida»)Ich tanze dir zu Ehren! Ich tanze, um deinen
bevorstehenden Sieg zu feiern! Du wirst
gewinnen!!\c"
MG05030007,"\h(«Merida»)Kirala gab mir dieses Kleid. Sie sagt, es
es ist die traditionelle Tracht yafutomanischer
Frauen bei Festlichkeiten.\e"
MG05030008,"\h(«Merida»)Ich würde es gern zum Tanzen anziehen, aber
es gibt mir nicht genug Bewegungsfreiheit.
Kirala meint, es würde 500 Goldstücke kosten,
um es zu ändern. Hast du das Geld?\e"
MG05030009,"\h(«Merida»)Wirklich? Vielen Dank!
Ich werde Kirala das Geld sofort geben!\c"
MG05030010,"\h(«Merida»)Ich freue mich über dein Angebot, aber du hast
nicht genug Geld……\c"
MG05030011,"\h(«Merida»)Ich möchte in diesem Kleid tanzen.
Es ist sehr schön……\c"
MG05030012,"\h(«Merida»)Gefällt dir dieser Tanz? Urala hat ihn mir
beigebracht! Es ist ein traditioneller Tanz
aus Yafutoma! Ich bin ganz begeistert davon!\c"
MG05100000,"\h(«Hans»)Ich lerne gerade alles über den Schiffbau von
Brabham.\e"
MG05100001,"\h(«Hans»)Brabham ist Experte für alle Arten von
Maschinen, alte und neue Modelle, und ich habe
eine Menge von ihm gelernt! Mein Vater wäre
stolz auf mich!\e"
MG05100002,"\h(«Hans»)Er gab mir das yafutomanische Buch über
Schiffspolarität zu lesen.\e"
MG05100003,"\h(«Hans»)Ich habe gelernt, einen Motor mit
Wellenbewegungs-Technologie zu bauen, und wie
man die Segel zum Schwebeflug verwendet!
Ich habe so viel gelernt.\c"
MG05100004,"\h(«Hans»)Diesen neuen Motor zu bauen, war ziemlich viel
Arbeit. Dieser alte Brabham ist wie eine
Maschine! Er arbeitet unheimlich hart!\e"
MG05100005,"\h(«Hans»)Er muss doch von all diesen durchwachten
Nächten müde sein, aber er lässt es sich
nicht anmerken. Er ist so voller Energie,
und das in seinem Alter!\c"
MG05100006,"\h(«Hans»)Also, den Stützpunkt haben wir ja nun wieder
aufgebaut, aber wir müssen uns jetzt für den
Angriff auf die Armada vorbereiten.\e"
MG05100007,"\h(«Hans»)Habt ihr bemerkt, wie schnell einige dieser
Schiffe waren? Und dass manche unter die Wolken
fliegen konnten?\e"
MG05100008,"\h(«Hans»)Wenn Valua nur seine Technologie dazu einsetzen
würde, Menschen zu helfen……\c"
MG05100009,"\h(«Hans»)Vyse……
Es wird Zeit für die Schlacht……\e"
MG05100010,"\h(«Hans»)Und ich erhielt die Nachricht von meinem Vater,
dass sein Schiff, die Ironclad, bereit ist,
auf unserer Seite zu kämpfen!\e"
MG05100011,"\h(«Hans»)Die Vorbereitungen auf der Delphinus werden
gerade abgeschlossen! Die gesamte Crew wartet
auf dich!\c"
MG05210000,"\h(«Tikatika»)He, Captain, von hier oben kann man die ganze
Insel überblicken!\e"
MG05210001,"\h(«Tikatika»)Heute gibt es nichts Neues. Also, außer
der Tatsache, dass Izmael Brabhams Mittagessen
gegessen hat, als der gerade nicht hinsah.\c"
MG05210002,"\h(«Tikatika»)Heute gibt es nichts zu berichten. Nun, außer,
dass Marco Magenschmerzen hat. Ich glaube, er
hat Wasser vom Teich getrunken……\c"
MG05210003,"\h(«Tikatika»)Haltet euch vom Teich fern. Prinz Enrique
und Prinzessin Moegi sagen einander auf
Wiedersehen, bevor er geht. Lasst sie in Ruhe.\c"
MG05210004,"\h(«Tikatika»)Heute gibt es nichts zu berichten. Aber ich
habe wohl bemerkt, dass Prinzessin Moegi jeden
Tag zum Teich hinuntergeht, um zu beten……\c"
MG05210005,"\h(«Tikatika»)Willkommen daheim, Captain. Ich wollte mal
sehen, wohin du in diesem kleinen Boot fährst,
aber……\e"
MG05210006,"\h(«Tikatika»)Ich kann den silbernen Schrein selbst mit meinen
Augen nicht richtig erkennen. Er muss sehr hoch
liegen. Das überrascht mich ein wenig.\e"
MG05210007,"\h(«Tikatika»)Ich kann diese Insel, die aus den Wolken
emporgestiegen ist, von hier aus nicht gut
erkennen…… selbst mit meinen Adleraugen.\e"
MG05210008,"\h(«Tikatika»)Aber ich spüre die Angst der Vögel, die vom Meer
her kommen. Das alles gibt mir ein schlechtes
Gefühl……\e"
MG05210009,"\h(«Tikatika»)Heute gibt es nichts zu berichten. He…… von
hier aus kann ich alle sehen!\e"
MG05210010,"\h(«Tikatika»)Alle haben sie so viel Energie! Ich spüre
ihren Geist. Ich bin sicher, wir werden die
Schlacht gegen die Armada gewinnen!\c"
MG07060000,"\h(«Don»)Als ich hörte, dass dieser Ort hier einmal
eine Wüsteninsel war, dachte ich, er würde
noch deprimierender sein als Esperanza.\e"
MG07060001,"\h(«Don»)Aber ihr habt hier eine gute Auswahl an Essen
und Trinken, und eine Mannschaft habt ihr auch
schon versammelt. Ihr macht eure Sache gut!\c"
MG07060002,"\h(«Don»)Polly ist die absolut beste Köchin!
Was sie kocht, ist einfach toll!\e"
MG07060003,"\h(«Don»)Wenn du nicht gewesen wärst, wäre ich voller
Selbstmitleid in Esperanza geblieben.\c"
MG07060004,"\h(«Don»)Ich habe noch nie zuvor die yafutomanische
Küche ausprobiert. Sie ist umwerfend!
Wenn ich es durch die Dark Rift geschafft hätte,
hätte ich sie schon vor langer Zeit entdeckt.\e"
MG07060005,"\h(«Don»)Ich bin froh, mit dir losgezogen zu sein, Vyse.
Mit deiner Crew zu segeln, macht einfach
riesengroßen Spaß.\c"
MG07060006,"\h(«Don»)In den Deep Sky? Ich hab's noch nicht
einmal durch die Dark Rift geschafft und jetzt
segle ich mit euch in die Unterwelt.\e"
MG07060007,"\h(«Don»)Vyse, ich muss dir etwas sagen. Wenn du mit
von der Partie bist, bleibt kein Auge trocken.
Es wäre ein Unterstatement zu sagen, dass du
mich inspirierst.\e"
MG07060008,"\h(«Don»)Wir hätten es alle durch die Dark Rift
geschafft, wenn du dabei gewesen wärst.\c"
MG07060009,"\h(«Don»)He, ich möchte unbedingt etwas über den Great
Silver Shrine erfahren!\e"
MG07060010,"\h(«Don»)Während ihr auf Abenteuerreise wart, habe ich
mich mit diesen Gebäuden abgeschuftet.\c"
MG07060011,"\h(«Don»)He, irgendetwas ist mit dem Yellow Moon
passiert. Es regnete Moon Stones auf Valua, und
danach gab es einige Explosionen.\e"
MG07060012,"\h(«Don»)Ich möchte meine Vergangenheit hinter mich
bringen, aber ich mache mir Sorgen um die
Valuaner. Sie sind nicht alle schlecht,
weißt du.\c"
MG07060013,"\h(«Don»)Jetzt ist es also so weit!
Wenn wir es alle schaffen zurückzukehren, werden
wir feiern!\e"
MG07060014,\h(«Don»)Ich leg schon mal ne Flasche Loqua kalt!\e
MG07060015,"\h(«Don»)Wir holen sie uns, Vyse!\c"
MG08030000,"\h(«Urala»)Oh…… Vyse. Ähm…… das ist wirklich eine schöne
Taverne.\e"
MG08030001,"\h(«Urala»)Ich wünschte, ich könnte jedem auf dieser Insel
yafutomanisches Essen servieren……\e"
MG08030002,"\h(«Urala»)Aber das ist wohl nicht möglich, ohne die
Küche vorher zu renovieren……\e"
MG08030003,"\h(«Urala»)Oh, mach dir keine Sorgen.
Ich vermisse einfach meine eigene Küche.\c"
MG08030004,"\h(«Urala»)Viele der Zutaten, die ich normalerweise in
Yafutoma benutze, sind hier wirklich schwer
zu bekommen.\e"
MG08030005,"\h(«Urala»)Ich wollte, dass alle eine Kostprobe der
yafutomanischen Küche erhalten!\e"
MG08030006,"\h(«Urala»)Aber die Zutaten sind teuer hier……
Dazu benötigt man mindestens 1.000
Goldstücke……\c"
MG08030007,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Urala 1.000 Goldstücke geben.”
“Nichts.”\e"
MG08030008,\h( )Du hast Urala 1.000 Goldstücke gegeben.\e
MG08030009,\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… Bist du dir ganz sicher?\e
MG08030010,"\h(«Vyse»)Klar, mach dir keine Sorgen.
Aber dann solltest du uns auch wirklich was
Leckeres kochen!\e"
MG08030011,"\h(«Urala»)Vielen Dank!
Ich fange gleich an!\c"
MG08030012,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… nett, dass du es angeboten hast,
aber du hast nicht genug Gold.\c"
MG08030013,"\h(«Urala»)Ich glaube aber nicht, dass ich für alle
yafutomanisches Essen zubereiten kann.\c"
MG08030014,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm, Vyse…… Vielen Dank!
Ich fange gleich an!\c"
MG08030015,"\h(«Urala»)Herzlich willkommen, was kann ich für dich tun?\e"
MG08030016,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Urala Essen kochen lassen.”
“Ein anderes Mal wiederkommen.”\e"
MG08030017,\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… ihr mögt also meine Kochkünste?\c
MG08030018,"\h(«Urala»)Vielen Dank!
Ich fange gleich an!\c"
MG08030019,"\h(«Urala»)Hmm…… Polly ist eine wirklich gute Köchin!
In Yafutoma haben wir diese Art von Küche
nicht.\e"
MG08030020,"\h(«Urala»)Sie ist sättigender, als ich es gewöhnt
bin, aber ich finde sie toll!\c"
MG08030021,"\h(«Urala»)Ähmm…… Ich koche euch gerne ein
yafutomanisches Essen. Kommt später
noch mal vorbei, wenn's geht.\c"
MG08030100,"\h(«Urala»)Oh…… Herzlich willkommen!
Ich habe mir Mühe gegeben, für die Mannschaft
zu kochen! Ich hoffe, sie mögen es!\e"
MG08030101,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… wenn ihr wollt, könnte ich euch Mahlzeiten
vorbereiten, die ihr mit auf eure Reisen
nehmen könnt……\e"
MG08030102,"\h(«Urala»)Ich brauche nur 10 “Romuhai-Fische”. Das ist
eine sehr verbreitete Fischart in Yafutoma……\e"
MG08030103,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Urala eine Mahlzeit kochen lassen.”
“Ein anderes Mal wiederkommen.”\e"
MG08030104,"\h(«Vyse»)Wenn es sich um Romuhai handelt, ich habe
gerade 10 davon hier.\e"
MG08030105,"\h(«Urala»)Wirklich? Wie toll! Dann kann ich ja gleich
anfangen!\e"
MG08030106,"\h(«Urala»)……Danke fürs Warten. Ich hoffe sehr, dass es
euch schmeckt.\e"
MG08030107,"\h(«Urala»)Es wird all eure Wunden heilen und eure Magie
regenerieren…… aber es dauert eine Weile, bis
es wirkt, also solltet ihr es nicht während
der Schlacht essen.\e"
MG08030108,\h( )Du erhieltst “Urala's Lunch” x 1!\c
MG08030109,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… es…… es tut mir Leid.
Du hast die 10 Romuhai-Fische nicht, die ich
brauche. Ohne sie kann ich das Gericht nicht
zubereiten……\c"
MG08030110,"\h(«Urala»)Wenn du mir 10 Romuhai-Fische bringst,
kann ich dir etwas ganz Besonderes zubereiten!\c"
MG08030111,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… tut mir Leid, aber ihr habt ja wohl noch
die Mahlzeit, die ich euch gegeben habe. Sie
wird euch ganz und gar heilen, also braucht
ihr nur eine davon.\c"
MG08030043,"\h(«Urala»)Ähm…… ich habe gehört, dass Polly zu Hause in
ihrer Heimatstadt eine Taverne besitzt.\e"
MG08030044,"\h(«Urala»)Also…… Polly ist wirklich 'ne Wucht. Ich bin
froh, dass sie mich hier in ihrer neuen Taverne
aushelfen lässt!\c"
MG08070000,"\h(«Moegi»)Das ist aber eine schöne Insel, die ihr hier
gefunden habt, Vyse. Dieser Teich erinnert
mich an zu Hause. Er ist sehr entspannend.\e"
MG08070001,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich wünschte, ich könnte einfach für immer
hier sitzen……\c"
MG08070002,\h(«Moegi»)Etwas scheint Prinz Enrique zu beunruhigen……\e
MG08070003,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich wünschte, er würde mir sagen, was es ist.
Vielleicht könnte ich etwas tun, um ihn zu
beruhigen……\c"
MG08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Prinz Enrique, ich weiß, Ihre Entscheidung
ist gefallen. Ich…… ich kann Ihre Loyalität und
die Liebe zu Ihrem Land verstehen.\e"
MG08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich kann Sie nicht aufhalten. Aber…… bitte,
bitte kommen Sie wieder gesund zu mir zurück.
Ich könnte es nicht ertragen, wenn Ihnen etwas
zustoßen würde……\c"
MG08070006,"\h(«Moegi»)Seitdem die Insel angegriffen wurde, mache
ich mir Sorgen um Prinz Enrique. Ich hoffe,
er befindet sich in Sicherheit……\e"
MG08070007,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich weiß, er ist stark, aber er ist ganz allein.
Ich versuche, das Beste zu hoffen, aber
ich befürchte das Schlimmste.\e"
MG08070008,"\h(«Moegi»)Bitte, Prinz Enrique, bitte……
kommen Sie zurück.\c"
MG08070009,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich hab ein ziemlich schlechtes Gefühl bei der
Insel, die sich aus dem Deep Sky erhoben hat.\e"
MG08070010,"\h(«Moegi»)Mir läuft ein Schauer den Rücken hinunter,
wenn ich nur daran denke.\c"
MG08070011,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich glaubte, Prinz Enrique schreien zu hören,
als die Moon Stones auf Valua fielen.
Ich hoffe, er ist in Sicherheit.\e"
MG08070012,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, Sie glauben doch, dass
Prinz Enrique in Sicherheit ist, nicht wahr?\c"
MG08070013,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich bin so froh, dass Prinz Enrique sicher
zurückgekehrt ist. Ich weiß nicht, was ich
getan hätte, wenn ihm etwas passiert wäre.\c"
MG08070014,"\h(«Moegi»)Captain Vyse, können Sie mich bitte mitnehmen,
wenn Sie gegen die Armada kämpfen?\e"
MG08070015,"\h(«Moegi»)Ich glaube nicht, dass ich es ertragen könnte,
noch einmal von Prinz Enrique getrennt zu sein……\c"
MG08070016,\h(«Moegi»)Vielleicht kann ich irgendwie behilflich sein……\e
MG08150000,"\h(«Kirala»)Captain, möchtest du irgendetwas umgebaut haben?
Ich würde nur zu gerne ein wenig yafutomanisches
Flair in unseren Stützpunkt bringen.\e"
MG08150001,"\h(«Was möchtest du tun?»)“Ein Gebäude umbauen.”
“Die Insel dekorieren.”
“Im Moment gar nichts.”\e"
MG08150002,"\h(«Kirala»)Es ist viel zu tun! Welches Gebäude soll ich
umbauen?\e"
MG08150003,"\h(«Was möchtest du gerne umbauen?»)“Den Wohnbereich…… 2.000 Goldstücke.”
“Taverne…… 1.500 Goldstücke.”\e"

MG08150005,"\h(«Was möchtest du gerne umbauen?»)“Den Wohnbereich…… 2.000 Goldstücke.”

“Kalifas Zelt…… 1.000 Goldstücke.”\e"
MG08150006,"\h(«Kirala»)Ihr wollt also, dass ich den Wohnbereich
umbaue? Das wird euch 2.000 Goldstücke kosten.
Möchtet ihr es trotzdem in Auftrag geben?\e"
MG08150007,"\h(«Den Wohnbereich umbauen?»)“Klar, leg los.”
“Hmm…… ich muss es mir noch mal überlegen.”\e"
MG08150008,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlasst es mir! Ich werde ihn im
yafutomanischen Stil umgebaut haben, wenn ihr
wieder auf die Insel zurückkommt.\c"
MG08150009,"\h(«Kirala»)Du willst also, dass ich die Taverne umbaue?
Das wird 1.500 Goldstücke kosten.
Soll ich es trotzdem machen?\e"

“Hm…… ich muss es mir noch mal überlegen.”\e"
MG08150011,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlass es mir! Ich werde sie im
yafutomanischen Stil umgebaut haben, wenn ihr
wieder auf die Insel zurückkommt.\c"
MG08150012,"\h(«Kirala»)Ich soll also Kalifas Zelt umbauen?
Das wird 1.000 Goldstücke kosten. Möchtet
ihr trotzdem, dass ich es mache?\e"
MG08150013,"\h(«Kalifas Zelt umbauen»)“Ja, leg los.”
“Hmm…… lass mich noch mal überlegen.”\e"
MG08150014,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlass es mir! Bis ihr zurück seid,
wird Kalifa ein neues Zelt haben. Vielleicht
gibt sie uns dann endlich ein paar nützlichere
Informationen.\c"
MG08150015,"\h(«Kirala»)He, ich dekoriere gerne!

MG08150016,"\h(«Was wollt ihr?»)“Ich möchte einen Springbrunnen auf dem Platz.”
“Ich möchte Fische im Teich.”

MG08150017,"\h(«Kirala»)He, ich dekoriere gerne!

“Lass gut sein, keine Dekoration.”\e"
MG08150021,"\h(«Kirala»)He, ich statte gerne Orte aus!
Was wollt ihr?\e"
MG08150022,"\h(«Was wollt ihr?»)“Der Springbrunnen soll umgebaut werden.”
“Lass gut sein, keine Dekoration.”\e"
MG08150023,"\h(«Kirala»)Ich soll also Taira-Fische in den Teich setzen?
Das macht jedoch 500 Goldstücke für die Fische.
Ist das in Ordnung?\e"
MG08150024,"\h(«Möchtest du Fische im Teich?»)“Au ja!”
“Nein, danke.”\e"
MG08150025,"\h(«Kirala»)Ich organisiere alles!
Wenn ihr Fische wollt, dann bekommt ihr sie
auch!\c"
MG08150026,"\h(«Kirala»)Also, ihr wollt, dass der Springbrunnen auf der
Plaza umgebaut wird. Wie soll ich ihn umbauen?\e"
MG08150027,"\h(«Wie möchtest du den Springbrunnen gerne haben?»)“Natürlich und elegant…… 500 Goldstücke.”
“Zu Ehren der Monde…… 5.000 Goldstücke.”
“Ist mir egal.”\e"
MG08150028,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlass es mir!
Ich werde euch einen fantastischen
yafutomanischen Springbrunnen bauen!\c"
MG08150029,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlasst es mir! Ich werde euch
überraschen! Es wird euch gefallen!\c"
MG08150030,"\h(«Kirala»)Was, der Springbrunnen hat euch nicht gefallen?\e"
MG08150031,"\h(«Kirala»)Statt dessen wollt ihr einen Springbrunnen
zu Ehren der Monde? Das macht 5.000 Goldstücke.
Geht das in Ordnung?\e"
MG08150032,"\h(«Möchtet ihr das machen?»)“Klar, bau den Springbrunnen um.”
“Ähm…… ach, lass nur.”\e"
MG08150033,"\h(«Kirala»)Ok, überlasst es mir!  Ich werde euch
überraschen! Es wird toll!\c"
MG08150034,"\h(«Kirala»)Was, euch hat der Cupil-Springbrunnen nicht
gefallen?\e"
MG08150035,"\h(«Kirala»)Wollt ihr stattdessen einen Springbrunnen mit
natürlicher Eleganz? Es wird euch 500
Goldstücke kosten. Ist das in Ordnung?\e"
MG08150036,"\h(«Möchtet ihr das machen?»)“Klar, bau den Springbrunnen um.”
“Ähm…… ach, lass nur.”\e"
MG08150037,"\h(«Kirala»)In Ordnung! Überlasst es mir! Ich baue einen
Springbrunnen von natürlicher Schönheit,
genauso wie der Springbrunnen, den wir zu
Hause in Yafutoma haben!\c"
MG08150038,"\h(«Kirala»)He, ich bin zwar toll, aber ohne Gold kann
ich auch nichts machen. Komm wieder, wenn du
genug hast.\c"
MG08150039,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, du willst deine Pläne noch mal überdenken?
Sag Bescheid, wenn du weißt, was du willst.\c"
MG08150040,"\h(«Kirala»)Nun, um ganz ehrlich zu sein, mir gefällt er so.
Ich möchte ihn gar nicht umbauen.\c"
MG08150041,"\h(«Kirala»)Überlass es mir! Er wird fertig sein, wenn
ihr wieder auf die Insel zurückkommt.\c"
MG08150042,"\h(«Kirala»)Oh, warte mal…… wolltest du ihn nicht bereits
von Izmael umbauen lassen?\e"
MG08150043,"\h(«Kirala»)Wenn du willst, kann ich ihn für euch umbauen.
Ist das ok?\e"
MG08150044,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Ihn von Izmael umbauen lassen.”
“Ihn von Kirala umbauen lassen.”\e"
MG08150045,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh, Tut mir Leid. Ich hatte vergessen, dass ich
bereits Izmael gebeten habe, das zu übernehmen.\e"
MG08150046,"\h(«Kirala»)Hahaha…… schon in Ordnung.
Also, wenn du ihn später noch mal umbauen
willst, brauchst du es mir nur zu sagen.\c"
MG08150047,"\h(«Vyse»)Tja…… aber ich habe mir die Sache anders
überlegt. Ich habe beschlossen, dass
du den Umbau machen sollst.\e"
MG08150048,"\h(«Kirala»)Hahaha…… es geht wohl nichts über wahre
Qualität. Ich werde Izmael Bescheid sagen und
das Geld von ihm wiederholen.\e"
MG08150049,"\h(«Kirala»)Überlass einfach alles mir, ok?
Ich zeige dir die Schönheit der yafutomanischen
Architektur!\c"
MG08150050,"\h(«Kirala»)Der Springbrunnen? Nun, sieht so aus, als
ob der gute Izmael den schon übernommen hat.
Tut mir Leid, aber es ist schon etwas spät
für mich, den Job anzunehmen.\c"
MG08150051,"\h(«Kirala»)Also, Izmael hat schon mit seinen
Vorbereitungen begonnen. Ich glaube,
es ist zu spät für mich, etwas daran zu
ändern.\c"
MG14010000,"\h(«Izmael»)Was kann ich für dich tun?
Willst du etwas umgebaut haben?\e"
MG14010001,"\h(«Was möchtest du machen?»)“Die Gebäude umbauen.”
“Die Insel verschönern.”
“Ist mir egal.”\e"
MG14010002,"\h(«Izmael»)Also, du willst, dass ich an den Gebäuden
arbeite? Klar, mach ich!\e"
MG14010003,"\h(«Was möchtest du umbauen?»)“Den Wohnbereich…… 2.000 Goldstücke.”
“Die Taverne…… 1.500 Goldstücke.”\e"
MG14010004,"\h(«Izmael»)Also, du willst, dass ich an den Gebäuden
arbeite? Klar, mach ich!\e"
MG14010005,"\h(«Was möchtest du umbauen?»)“Den Wohnbereich…… 2.000 Goldstücke.”
“Die Taverne…… 1.500 Goldstücke.”
“Kalifas Zelt…… 1.000 Goldstücke.”\e"
MG14010006,"\h(«Izmael»)Du willst deinen Wohnbereich umgebaut
haben? Das wird 2.000 Goldstücke kosten……
Soll ich das wirklich machen?\e"
MG14010007,"\h(«Den Wohnbereich umbauen?»)“Fang gleich damit an.”
“Hmm…… lass es mich noch mal überdenken.”\e"
MG14010008,"\h(«Izmael»)Überlass das nur mir! Es wird dir gefallen!
Es wird alles fertig sein, wenn ihr zur Insel
zurückkehrt.\c"
MG14010009,"\h(«Izmael»)Ihr wollt also die Taverne umgebaut haben?
Das macht 1.500 Goldstücke.
Geht das in Ordnung?\e"
MG14010010,"\h(«Wollt ihr die Taverne umgebaut haben?»)“Ja, leg los.”
“Hmm…… lass mich noch mal darüber nachdenken.”\e"
MG14010011,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, überlasst es mir! Ich werde alles unter
Kontrolle haben, bis ihr wieder auf die
Insel zurückkommt.\c"
MG14010012,"\h(«Izmael»)Du willst also Kalifas Zelt umbauen?
Das macht 1.000 Goldstücke.
Wie findest du das?\e"
MG14010013,"\h(«Kalifas Zelt umbauen?»)“Ja, leg los.”
“Hmm…… lass mich noch mal darüber nachdenken.”\e"
MG14010014,"\h(«Izmael»)Ok, überlasst es mir! Ich werde das Relief
fertig haben, bis ihr wieder auf der Insel
seid.\c"
MG14010015,"\h(«Izmael»)Ihr wollt also, dass ich hier alles in
Ordnung bringe? Wo soll ich anfangen?\e"
MG14010016,"\h(«Was soll er bauen?»)“Springbrunnen…… 500 Goldstücke.”
“Relief…… 1.000 Goldstücke.”
“Nichts.”\e"
MG14010017,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich werde ein Relief über dem Teich bauen.
Was für eines wollt ihr?\e"
MG14010018,"\h(«Izmael»)Ihr wollt, dass ich hier etwas aufräume?
Ein Bauarbeiter hat stets zu tun, deshalb
habe ich diesen Job gewählt!\e"
MG14010019,"\h(«Was soll er machen?»)“Den Springbrunnen umbauen…… 500 Goldstücke.”
“Ein Relief anfertigen…… 1.000 Goldstücke.”
“Nichts.”\e"
MG14010020,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich werde euren Springbrunnen umbauen……
im Matrosenstil!\c"
MG14010021,"\h(«Izmael»)Dann werde ich das Gesicht von einem von euch
in die Wand über dem Teich meißeln, wessen
Gesicht soll es sein?\e"
MG14010022,"\h(«Wessen Gesicht möchtest du?»)“Ich möchte meines gemeißelt haben.”
“Ich möchte lieber Aikas Gesicht.”
“Ich möchte lieber Finas Gesicht.”\e"
MG14010023,"\h(«Izmael»)Du willst dein Gesicht verewigt haben? Kein
Problem! Es wäre mir eine Ehre, dich in Stein
zu hauen. Du wirst famos aussehen.\c"
MG14010024,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich kann Aika abbilden. Das Haar wird
vielleicht etwas schwierig, aber das ist
eine schöne Herausforderung!\c"
MG14010025,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich kann Fina in Stein meißeln. Es wäre mir
eine Ehre, solch rare Schönheit abzubilden!\c"
MG14010026,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse, dieses Gesicht ist schon an der Wand!
Mach mal ab und an eine Pause,
du arbeitest zu viel.\e"
MG14010027,"\h(«Izmael»)Wie schade.
Wenn du deine Meinung änderst, lass es mich
wissen!\c"
MG14010028,"\h(«Izmael»)Captain, du hast nicht genug Geld. Ich würde
es umsonst machen, aber ich muss Material und
so weiter besorgen. Komm wieder, wenn du das
Gold hast.\c"
MG14010029,"\h(«Izmael»)Vyse, das habe ich schon umgebaut.
Es ist absolut perfekt.\c"
MG14010030,"\h(«Izmael»)Bam bam baaam!
Hast du nicht schon Kirala gebeten, dieses
Gebäude für dich umzubauen?\e"
MG14010031,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich könnte es umbauen, wenn du willst!\e"
MG14010032,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Es Kirala umbauen lassen.”
“Es Izmael umbauen lassen.”\e"
MG14010033,"\h(«Vyse»)Oh…… ich hatte fast vergessen, dass ich Kirala
gebeten hatte, es umzubauen. Tut mir Leid,
Izmael.\e"
MG14010034,"\h(«Izmael»)Ba-bam!
Sieht so aus, als würdest du etwas vergesslich
auf deine alten Tage! Hahahaha!\e"
MG14010035,"\h(«Vyse»)Also, ich habe darüber nachgedacht,
und ich möchte, dass du es umbaust.\e"
MG14010036,"\h(«Izmael»)Zu Befehl!
Ich mache mich gleich an die Arbeit!\e"
MG14010037,"\h(«Izmael»)Ich werde mir das Geld von Kirala holen.
Du brauchst dich um nichts zu kümmern, ok?
Überlass einfach alles mir!\c"
MG14010038,"\h(«Izmael»)Sieht so aus, als hätte Kirala schon damit
angefangen. Jetzt kann ich da nichts mehr
machen.\c"
MG14010039,"\h(«Izmael»)Sieht so aus, als hätte Kirala schon damit
angefangen. Jetzt kann ich da nichts mehr
machen.\c"
MG14040000,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich habe alles verloren, was mir am Herzen lag……
Ich habe alles in der Dark Rift verloren.\e"
MG14040001,"\h(«Robinson»)……Alles, was ich noch hatte, waren meine
Erinnerungen an Polly.\e"
MG14040002,"\h(«Robinson»)Während dieser Jahre in der Dark Rift wurde mir
klar, wie wichtig mir Polly war.\e"
MG14040003,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich war mir nie darüber klar, was ich an ihr
hatte, bis sie fort war. Ich werde an ihrer
Seite bleiben, bis wir hier fertig sind.
Dann gehen wir zurück nach Sailors Island.\c"
MG14040004,"\h(«Robinson»)Ich weiß, dass ich für eine ganze Weile in der
Dark Rift verschollen war, aber es ist gut
zu wissen, dass Polly ihre Kochkünste nicht
verlernt hat.\e"
MG14040005,"\h(«Robinson»)Während dieser ganzen Zeit musste ich immer
an sie denken. Jetzt, wo ich wieder da bin,
werde ich sie nie mehr als selbstverständlich
hinnehmen.\c"
MG14040006,"\h(«Robinson»)Captain Vyse…… ich nehme an, wir brechen jetzt
zu dieser furchtbaren Insel auf……\e"
MG14040007,"\h(«Robinson»)Wir müssen Valua stoppen, bevor sie alles
zerstören. Polly und ich haben noch unser
ganzes Leben vor uns.\c"
MG14040008,"\h(«Robinson»)Wir müssen diesen Kampf gewinnen!
Ich tue alles, um euch zu helfen!\e"
MG14040009,"\h(«Robinson»)Captain Vyse, du solltest dich entspannen und
ein gutes Essen zu dir nehmen, bevor du wieder
die Segel setzt.\e"
MG14040010,"\h(«Robinson»)Nachdem ich so lange Zeit verschollen war,
weiß ich eine gute Mahlzeit sehr zu schätzen.\c"
MGp0010000,"\h(«Aika»)Wo wir jetzt unseren eigenen Inselstützpunkt
haben, fühlst du dich sicher wie ein richtiger
Kapitän. Captain Vyse…… hört sich gut an.\e"
MGp0010001,"\h(«Aika»)Du bist in deinem eigenen Schiff um die Welt
gesegelt! Nicht viele Leute können von sich
behaupten, dass sie ihre Kindheitsträume
verwirklicht haben, weißt du.\e"
MGp0010002,"\h(«Vyse»)Aika, das hört sich so an, als ob ich gleich
in den Ruhestand ginge. Es gibt noch so viel,
das ich nicht gesehen habe.\e"
MGp0010003,"\h(«Vyse»)Und es gibt noch viele unentdeckte Schätze
aufzuspüren. Vor uns liegt ein langer Weg!\e"
MGp0010004,"\h(«Aika»)Haha, das sieht dir ähnlich! Keine Sorge,
ich bin mit von der Partie! Besonders, wenn
es dabei um Schätze geht.\c"
MGp0010005,"\h(«Aika»)Ich werde mein Bestes tun, Captain Vyse. Haha……
Hört sich gut an. Dabei muss ich lachen.\c"
MGp0010006,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse, jetzt, wo du höher und tiefer fliegen
kannst als je zuvor, können wir uns all die
Orte vornehmen, an denen wir noch nicht waren!\c"
MGp0010020,"\h(«Aika»)Brabham sollte die Arbeit an der Delphinus
jetzt eigentlich beendet haben!\e"
MGp0010021,"\h(«Aika»)Schnell zurück zum Hafen, Vyse!\c"
MGp0010007,"\h(«Aika»)Ich wollte Enrique eigentlich
'Brech-Prinz' taufen, weil er sich immer über
die Bordkante übergeben hat……\e"
MGp0010008,"\h(«Aika»)Jetzt hat er sich aber zu einem richtigen
Seemann gemausert!\e"
MGp0010009,"\h(«Aika»)Es wird schon werden…… nicht wahr, Vyse……?\c"
MGp0010010,"\h(«Aika»)Haha, das sieht dir ähnlich! Keine Sorge,
ich bin mit von der Partie! Besonders, wenn
es dabei um Schätze geht.\c"
MGp0010011,"\h(«Aika»)Ich wollte nicht glauben, dass meine Mutter
und mein Vater nach ihrem Tod an so einen
furchtbaren Ort kommen würden……\e"
MGp0010012,"\h(«Aika»)Also habe ich mir geschworen, eines Tages
zum Deep Sky zu reisen und es mit eigenen
Augen zu sehen. Ich wollte beweisen, dass
alle Unrecht hatten.\c"
MGp0010013,"\h(«Aika»)Ich hoffe, Fina geht es gut……
Sie sagt ja, aber sie sieht so
traurig aus……\e"
MGp0010014,"\h(«Aika»)War Elder Prime nicht wie ein Großvater
zu ihr? Es muss sehr schwer für sie gewesen
sein, ihn zu verlieren.\c"
MGp0010015,"\h(«Aika»)Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass Galcian die
Rains of Destruction tatsächlich anwenden
würde!\e"
MGp0010016,"\h(«Aika»)Und noch dazu auf sein eigenes Land!
Ich kann nicht glauben, wie viele Leute er
getötet hat. Wir müssen einen Weg finden,
um ihn aufzuhalten!\c"
MGp0010022,"\h(«Aika»)Also hängt alles von dieser Schlacht ab……
Ich war letzte Nacht richtig nervös und habe
nicht viel geschlafen.\e"
MGp0010023,"\h(«Aika»)Zuerst hatte ich Angst, aber als ich an all
die Luftpiraten dachte, die hier sind, um mit
uns zu kämpfen, fing ich an, mich besser zu
fühlen.\e"
MGp0010024,"\h(«Aika»)Los, Vyse, alle warten sie auf uns bei
der Delphinus! Schnell zurück zum Hafen!\c"
MGp0010025,"\h(«Aika»)Los, Vyse, alle warten sie auf uns bei
der Delphinus! Schnell zurück zum Hafen!\c"
MGp0010026,"\h(«Aika»)Guten Morgen, Vyse!
Danke für die Zusprache, die du mir gestern
Abend gegeben hast. Ich konnte mich etwas
entspannen und habe auch geschlafen.\e"
MGp0010027,"\h(«Aika»)Ich weiß, dass wir Galcian schlagen können.
Ich habe Vertrauen in alle…… und ich habe
Vertrauen in dich.\e"
MGp0010028,"\h(«Aika»)Wenn du an meiner Seite wärst, würde ich es
mit jedem aufnehmen. Ich bin sicher, die
anderen Luftpiraten sind der gleichen Meinung.\e"
MGp0010029,"\h(«Aika»)He, he…… wir werden unser Bestes tun.
Alle rechnen mit dir, Vy…… ich meine,
Cap'n Vyse!!!\c"
MGp0010030,"\h(«Aika»)Los, Vyse, alle warten sie auf uns bei
der Delphinus! Schnell zurück zum Hafen!\c"
MGp0010017,"\h(«Aika»)Ich dachte, alles wäre vorbei, wenn wir
einmal Galcian besiegt haben, aber es sieht
so aus, als hätte ich Unrecht, nicht wahr?\e"
MGp0010018,"\h(«Aika»)Ich habe aber keine Angst, weil du da bist……
und wir haben es ja zusammen ziemlich weit
gebracht, nicht wahr?\e"
MGp0010019,"\h(«Aika»)Ok, gehen wir und schlagen wir Ramirez
windelweich, damit wir nach Crescent Isle
zurück können und die größte Party aller Zeiten
feiern!\c"
MGp0020000,"\h(«Fina»)Es ist eine…… sehr schöne Insel.
Und ihr habt sogar ein Zimmer für mich.\e"
MGp0020001,"\h(«Fina»)Ich kann's nicht fassen…… ich habe tatsächlich
mein eigenes Zimmer in eurem Heimatstützpunkt……\e"
MGp0020002,"\h(«Fina»)Ich fühle mich wie ein Mitglied der Blue
Rogues. Ich…… ich bin so glücklich.
Danke, Vyse.\e"
MGp0020003,"\h(«Fina»)Als wir ihn zum letzten Mal sahen, sagte
Drachma, dass es nicht einfach für ihn sein
würde, sein Leben noch mal von vorn
anzufangen……\e"
MGp0020004,"\h(«Fina»)Glaubst du, er kommt wieder zu uns,
wenn er sich besser fühlt?\c"
MGp0020005,"\h(«Fina»)Wir haben endlich alle Moon Crystals zusammen.
Meine Mission ist endlich vorbei.
Danke für all eure Hilfe.\c"
MGp0020006,"\h(«Fina»)Wir können endlich runter in den Deep Sky?
Darüber weiß ich nicht viel.
Ich habe etwas Angst……\e"
MGp0020007,"\h(«Fina»)Ich nehme an, es ist Zeit, nach meinem Schiff
zu suchen…… Danke für alles, was ihr für mich
getan habt……\c"
MGp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Also, die Delphinus wird in der Lage sein, im
Deep Sky zu segeln…… ich hätte mir nie
träumen lassen, dass ich einmal nach dort
unten abtauchen würde.\c"
MGp0020008,\h(«Fina»)Enrique kehrt in seine Heimat Valua zurück……\e
MGp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Ich muss auch in meine Heimat zurückkehren,
sobald wir mein Schiff finden.
Ich…… ich will fast nicht mehr zurück.\e"
MGp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)Ich bin soweit. Ich habe beschlossen, keine
Zeit mehr damit zu verschwenden, darüber
nachzudenken, wie sich Ramirez verändert hat.
Man muss ihn aufhalten.\e"
MGp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez und ich…… wir wurden beide von den
Elders im Great Silver Shrine erzogen.\e"
MGp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)Unter den Ältesten war Elder Prime derjenige
mit dem meisten Wissen. Er wusste alles, von
geschichtlichen Aufzeichnungen bis zu den
neuesten Geschehnissen in der Welt.\e"
MGp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez war immer am meisten an den Geschichten
von Elder Prime über die Chronicles of Arcadia
interessiert. Sie konnten Stunden miteinander
verbringen.\e"
MGp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Ich glaube, es waren die Geschichten von
Elder Prime, die Ramirez veranlassten, nach den
Kristallen zu suchen. Ich kann's nicht glauben,
dass Ramirez…… ihn getötet hat……\c"
MGp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, es wurden so viele Leute getötet, als
die Rains of Destruction auf Valua
niederprasselten.\e"
MGp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Ramirez und der Silver Gigas Zelos sind
dafür verantwortlich.\e"
MGp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Als Silviterin hätte ich…… Ramirez aufhalten
sollen……\c"
MGp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Endlich ist die Zeit gekommen, um Ramirez
gegenüberzutreten. Ehrlich gesagt finde ich e……
 es ziemlich schwierig, gegen ihn zu kämpfen.\e"
MGp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)Aber als Silviterin…… muss ich ihn aufhalten.
Es ist meine Pflicht.\e"
MGp0020023,"\h(«Fina»)Ich werde mein Bestes tun. Wir dürfen nicht
zulassen, dass Galcian und Ramirez diese Welt
zerstören.\c"
MGp0020024,"\h(«Fina»)Galcian und Ramirez müssen aufgehalten werden,
bevor unschuldige Leben geopfert werden.\c"
MGp0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Guten Morgen, Vyse.
Ähm…… danke für das, was du gestern Abend
getan hast.\e"
MGp0020026,"\h(«Fina»)Um ganz ehrlich zu sein, es ist ziemlich
schwer für mich, gegen Ramirez zu kämpfen.
Aber……\e"
MGp0020027,"\h(«Fina»)Ich möchte kämpfen.
Ich will dabei helfen, diese Welt zu retten.
Ich…… ich möchte an eurer Seite kämpfen.\e"
MGp0020028,"\h(«Fina»)Deshalb will ich versuchen, mein Bestes
zu tun. Solange ihr an meiner Seite kämpft,
glaube ich, dass wir gewinnen können.\c"
MGp0020029,"\h(«Fina»)Gehen wir, Vyse. Sie warten sicher alle bei
der Delphinus auf uns.\c"
MGp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Gehen wir, Vyse, wir müssen Ramirez aufhalten.\e"
MGp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)Um diese Welt zu erhalten…… und zur Erinnerung
an Elder Prime…… muss Ramirez aufgehalten
werden.\c"
MGp0040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Hallo, Vyse. Für einen geheimen Stützpunkt
ist das hier ziemlich eindrucksvoll.\e"
MGp0040001,"\h(«Enrique»)Je mehr Leute uns auf dem Stützpunkt und auf
der Delphinus helfen, desto besser klappt
alles.\e"
MGp0040002,"\h(«Enrique»)Du bist der Einzige, der über die Erfahrung
und die Entschlusskraft verfügt, diese
Mannschaft zum Sieg zu führen. Wir alle
warten auf dich, Vyse!\e"
MGp0040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, ich habe dir die Delphinus anvertraut.
Bitte sei vorsichtig damit, vielleicht will
ich sie eines Tages wiederhaben.\c"
MGp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich habe mich immer gefragt, wann ich nach
Valua zurückkehren würde…… aber irgendwie
ist es nicht ganz so, wie ich es mir
vorgestellt habe……\c"
MGp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Wir haben endlich alle Moon Crystals zusammen.
Jetzt kann ich endlich die Tyrannei meiner
Mutter beenden.\e"
MGp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Obwohl wir nicht auf derselben Seite kämpfen,
ist sie nach wie vor meine Mutter.\e"
MGp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich hoffe, dass ich sie von ihrer Torheit
überzeugen kann, und dass wir zu einer
Übereinstimmung gelangen.\c"
MGp0040008,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… tut mir Leid, aber könntest du mich
eine Weile in Ruhe lassen?\e"
MGp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Die Modifikationen auf der Delphinus sollten
beendet sein. Gehen wir zurück zum Hafen,
Vyse.\c"
MGp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Komm schon, Vyse. Sei nicht so besorgt. Ich
werd's schon schaffen. Ich hab nicht vor, so
schnell zu sterben. Ich muss mich ja noch
um mein Land kümmern.\e"
MGp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)Ich…… ich habe nur noch eine Bitte an dich,
Vyse. Bitte…… kümmere dich um Prinzessin Moegi,
während ich weg bin. Sie…… sie bedeutet mir
so viel.\c"
MGp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Also, es ist Zeit, sich Galcian zu stellen.
Ich werde euch auf der Delphinus begleiten.\e"
MGp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Galcian muss dafür bezahlen, dass er meine
Heimat zerstört und meine Mutter…… und
Gregorio…… getötet hat.\c"
MGp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)So ist es…… wenn wir gewinnen, wird die Welt
in Frieden leben. Wir müssen diese Schlacht
gewinnen!\e"
MGp0040014,"\h(«Enrique»)Gehen wir, Vyse…… nein, Captain Vyse!
Führe uns zum Sieg!\c"
MS01000000,"\h(«Polly»)Este sitio no está mal. Me recuerda un poco a la
taberna de Isla Los Marinos.\e"
MS01000001,\h(«Polly»)Creo que aquí sí voy a poder cocinar……\e
MS01000002,"\h(«Polly»)Pero a la cocina no le vendrían mal unas
reformas. Para poder cocinar mis famosos platos
voy a tener que introducir mejoras.\c"
MS01000003,"\h(«Polly»)Si me dejas remodelar este sitio, abriré una
taberna aquí en tu isla.\c"
MS01000004,"\h(«Polly»)Ahora que tengo una cocina que puedo usar, voy a
necesitar algunos accesorios de cocina para
ponerme manos a la obra.\e"

manos a la obra, pero necesito el oro.\e"
MS01000010,"\h(«Polly»)Tan pronto como tenga las 1.000 piezas de oro

que te ayudará en la misión?\e"
MS01000102,"\h(«Polly»)Los marinos lo llamaban “Especial de Polly”.

Siéntate. ¡Marchando un “Especial de Polly”!\e"
MS01000106,"\h(«Polly»)…… ¡Gracias por esperar!
¡Aquí tienes!\e"
MS01000107,"\h(«Polly»)Además de reponer toda tu magia, curará todas
tus heridas, pero tarda un poco en hacer efecto,

sopa con pescado.

MS01000043,"\h(«Polly»)Qué gusto poder dejar de cocinar un rato y comer
las delicias que cocina Urala. ¡Es genial!\c"
MS01140032,"\h(«Pinta»)Muy bien, si puedo coger uno, lo traeré a la
Isla de la Luna ¿de acuerdo?\c"
MS01140033,"\h(«Pinta»)¡He encontrado unas islas donde viven unos
animales muy interesantes!\e"
MS01140034,"\h(«Pinta»)¿Que dónde está la isla? Eh…… Es un secreto.
Si lo que te interesa son los animales, puedo
traerte algunos.\e"
MS01140035,"\h(«Pinta»)Te costará 500 piezas de oro darles de comer.
¿Sigues interesado en que te los traiga?\e"
MS01140036,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Sí, tráeme alguno, Pinta.”
“Ahora que lo pienso, déjalo.”\e"
MS01140037,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Animales? Bueno…… Quizá sea buena idea tener
mascotas por aquí. ¿Por qué no? Sí, trae algún
animal para la isla, ¿de acuerdo?\e"
MS01140038,"\h(«Pinta»)¡Por supuesto, Capitán!
Pero primero, ¿qué tipo de animales te
interesan?\e"
MS01140039,"\h(«¿Qué tipo te interesa?»)“Uno simpático del Este.”

Bueno, ven cuando tengas suficiente y yo me
ocuparé de conseguirte lo que quieres.\c"
MS01140041,"\h(«Pinta»)Está bien, pero creo que sería una buena idea
traer unas mascotas aquí. Si cambias de idea,
dímelo, ¿vale?\c"
MS01140042,"\h(«Pinta»)¡Eh! ¿Te gustan los animales que he capturado
para ti?\e"
MS01140043,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decirle a Pinta?»)“¡Son perfectos!”
“Mmm…… Preferiría de otro tipo.”\e"
MS01140044,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Sí, son perfectos!
Me encantan. Gracias por traérmelos, Pinta.\e"
MS01140045,"\h(«Pinta»)¡Qué bien! Me alegro de que te gusten.
Bueno, si un día te apetece tener algún animal
de otra raza, ¡avísame!\c"
MS01140046,"\h(«Vyse»)Me gustan los animales que has traído, Pinta,
pero quisiera saber cómo son los demás
animales……\e"
MS01140047,"\h(«Pinta»)Bueno, pero si quieres que te traiga animales
distintos, te va a costar 500 piezas de oro.\e"
MS01140048,"\h(«Pinta»)Y si mezclamos seis tipos distintos de animales
en esta isla, lucharán entre ellos. Voy a tener
que devolver estos otros a su isla.\e"
MS01140049,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decir?»)“Bueno…… Entonces déjalo.”
“Claro, esta vez trae algo distinto.”\e"
MS01140050,"\h(«Pinta»)Si alguna vez quieres otros animales, ¡avísame!\c"

MS01140058,"\h(«Vyse»)Creo que me quedaré con los que son tan
simpáticos, si no Aika empezará a quejarse.\e"
MS01140059,"\h(«Pinta»)¡Por supuesto, Capitán!
¡Me voy a capturarlos de inmediato!\e"
MS01140060,"\h(«Vyse»)Creo que aquí necesitamos una nota de color.
¿Por qué no capturas unos cuantos animales
exóticos?\e"
MS01140061,"\h(«Pinta»)¡Sí, Capitán!

mundo entero. ¡Gracias, Vyse! ¡Estoy impaciente
por volver a navegar!\c"
MS02000002,"\h(«Marco»)Anda…… Lo que más me sorprendió al irme de Valua
fue el cielo…… Es azul.
Nunca había visto el cielo azul……\e"
MS02000003,"\h(«Marco»)¡Y las nubes son blancas! ¡Creía que serían
oscuras como las de Valua!\e"
MS02000004,"\h(«Marco»)¡No os riáis! ¡Si hubierais estado en el Arrabal
de Valua toda vuestra vida, lo entenderíais!\c"

MS02000006,"\h(«Marco»)Eh…… Quién iba a pensar que me convertiría en
mecánico…… ¡He ayudado a construir eso!

encontrar todo terminado en la isla?\e"
MS02000008,"\h(«Marco»)¡También le he ayudado mucho a Izmael! Bueno……
¡Sólo he pintado las paredes, pero aun
así era mucho trabajo!\c"
MS02000009,"\h(«Marco»)Chicos, ¿habéis visto las estrellas fugaces que
cayeron sobre Valua?\e"
MS02000010,"\h(«Marco»)Desde entonces, Aika y tú parecéis muy
preocupados. ¿Qué pasa? ¿Ha ocurrido algo
malo?\c"
MS02000011,"\h(«Marco»)La Armada hizo que las Piedras Lunares cayeran
sobre Valua, ¿es eso?\e"
MS02000012,"\h(«Marco»)No…… No me gustaba ese sitio, pero…… crecí allí.
Me entristece que haya desaparecido todo.\e"
MS02000013,"\h(«Marco»)Vyse, me tienes que prometer que venceremos a la
Armada. No podemos dejarles escapar después de
todo lo que han hecho.\c"
MS02000014,"\h(«Marco»)Tenemos que detenerles antes de que destruyan
los demás países. Aún me queda mucho por ver.\c"
MS04090000,"\h(«Kalifa»)Bienvenido. Si escucháis mis palabras os
revelaré el futuro……\e"

fácil hacer la digestión.\c"
MS04090014,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo! ¡Tener un bajo “Rango de
Bucanero” va a afectar a tu misión!\e"

batallas e incluso evitarlas por completo!\c"
MS04090016,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo! Mmm…… Mañana va a estar
nublado en algunas zonas y hay posibilidades de
lluvia.\e"

dejéis secar dentro!\c"
MS04090018,"\h(«Kalifa»)¡Sí, sí! ¡Veo algo! ¡Tener un “Rango de

habilidad de liderazgo!\c"

Chum especiales llamados “Chum Abirik”.\e"

propio barco y tu Espíritu es tan alto como sea
posible……\e"

hilo. Tienes que ser fuerte porque el destino

batallas, se correrá la voz sobre tu valentía

MS04090043,"\h(«Kalifa»)Por otro lado, si siempre huyes de tus
adversarios, la gente hablará de tu
cobardía. Sé prudente en tus acciones.\c"

Izmael se ha comido el almuerzo de Brabham
cuando él no miraba.\c"

dolor de estómago de Marco. Creo que ha bebido
agua del estanque……\c"
MS05210003,"\h(«Tikatika»)Que nadie se acerque al estanque. El Príncipe
Enrique y la Princesa Moegi están despidiéndose.
Es un momento íntimo.\c"

que la Princesa Moegi va al estanque todos los

adónde ibais en ese pequeño bote, pero……\e"
MS05210006,"\h(«Tikatika»)Ni siquiera yo vi el Gran Relicario de Plata. Me
sorprende, nunca me falla la vista. Debe estar a
gran altitud en el cielo……\e"

debajo de las nubes……

Océano están asustados. Me da muy mala espina

Navegar contigo es la mejor experiencia que he

la Gruta Oscura. Y ahora estoy a punto de irme a
navegar hacia el submundo.\e"

estás presente, nunca me aburro. Decir que me

época, todos habríamos conseguido pasar por la
Gruta Oscura.\c"

Relicario de Plata!\e"
MS07060010,"\h(«Don»)Mientras estabas por ahí de aventuras, yo estaba
aquí rompiéndome las espaldas.\c"
MS07060011,"\h(«Don»)Algo ha pasado con la Luna Amarilla. Llovieron
Piedras Lunares sobre Valua y luego hubo varias
explosiones.\e"

siguen preocupándome.
No todos son malos, sabes.\c"

tripulación! ¡Espero que os guste!\e"

llevar y te las comes cuando estés de viaje……\e"

taberna en la ciudad.\e"

puedo hacer algo para tranquilizarse un poco……\c"
MS08070004,"\h(«Moegi»)Príncipe Enrique, sé que tu decisión está
tomada. Yo…… entiendo tu lealtad y cariño hacia
tu país.\e"
MS08070005,"\h(«Moegi»)No puedo detenerte. Pero…… por favor, vuelve
pronto. No podría soportar el sufrimiento si te
sucediera algo……\c"

preocupada por el Príncipe Enrique.

del Cielo Profundo.\e"

estará a salvo?\c"

Hemos llegado hasta aquí por tenernos el uno al

No sé mucho sobre él. Tengo miedo…… \e"

Muchas gracias por todo lo que habéis hecho por
mí……\e"
MSp0020020,"\h(«Fina»)Así que el Delphinus podrá navegar por el
Cielo Profundo…… Jamás pensé que iría a las
profundidades del cielo.\c"
MSp0020008,"\h(«Fina»)Enrique va a regresar a su tierra, Valua……\e"
MSp0020009,"\h(«Fina»)Yo también debo regresar a mi tierra
cuando encuentre mi navío…… casi no me apetece
volver.\e"
MSp0020010,"\h(«Fina»)Estoy bien. Me he dado cuenta de que no puedo
perder más el tiempo, lamentando que Ramírez
haya cambiado tanto. Tenemos que detenerle.\e"
MSp0020011,"\h(«Fina»)Ramírez y yo…… Fuimos criados por los Ancianos
en el Gran Relicario de Plata.\e"
MSp0020012,"\h(«Fina»)El más sabio era el Gran Anciano.
Lo sabía todo, los más remotos hechos históricos
y los asuntos de mayor actualidad.\e"
MSp0020013,"\h(«Fina»)Lo que más le interesaba a Ramírez eran
Crónicas de Arcadia que el Gran Anciano le
contaba. Se pasaba las horas escuchándole.\e"
MSp0020014,"\h(«Fina»)Creo que Ramírez fue en busca de los Cristales
por las historias del Gran Anciano.
No puedo creer que Ramírez…… le matara……\c"
MSp0020015,"\h(«Fina»)Vyse, murió tanta gente cuando las
Lluvias Destructoras cayeron sobre Valua.\e"
MSp0020016,"\h(«Fina»)Ramírez y Zelos, el Gigas de Plata, fueron los
responsables.\e"
MSp0020017,"\h(«Fina»)Como Silvite,
debería haber detenido a Ramírez……\c"
MSp0020021,"\h(«Fina»)Ha llegado el momento de enfrentarse a Ramírez.
Si te soy totalmente sincera, me resulta muy
difícil luchar contra él.\e"
MSp0020022,"\h(«Fina»)Pero, como Silvite…… tengo que detenerle.
Es mi deber.\e"
MSp0020023,"\h(«Fina»)Voy a intentarlo. No podemos permitir que
Galcian y Ramírez arrasen el mundo entero.\c"
MSp0020024,"\h(«Fina»)Hay que detener a Galcian y Ramírez
antes de que mueran más inocentes.\c"
MSp0020025,"\h(«Fina»)Buenos días, Vyse.
Esto…… gracias por todo lo de anoche.\e"
MSp0020026,"\h(«Fina»)Ha llegado el momento de enfrentarse a Ramírez.

duro luchar contra él.\e"
MSp0020027,"\h(«Fina»)Pero quiero hacerlo. Quiero salvar al mundo.
Quiero…… quiero luchar junto a ti.\e"
MSp0020028,"\h(«Fina»)Por eso voy a esforzarme. Mientras tú luches a
mi lado, sabré que la victoria es nuestra.\c"
MSp0020029,"\h(«Fina»)Vamos, Vyse. Los demás deben estar esperándonos
en el Delphinus.\c"
MSp0020018,"\h(«Fina»)Vamos, Vyse, debemos detener a Ramírez.\e"
MSp0020019,"\h(«Fina»)Por el futuro de este mundo…… y por la memoria
del Gran Anciano, debemos detener a Ramírez.\c"
MSp0040000,"\h(«Enrique»)Hola, Vyse. Para ser una base oculta,
es de lo más imponente.\e"
MSp0040001,"\h(«Enrique»)Cuantos más miembros en la tripulación, en
nuestra base y en el Delphinus, todo funcionará
mejor.\e"
MSp0040002,"\h(«Enrique»)Eres el único con la suficiente experiencia y
decisión para llevar a esta tripulación a la
victoria. ¡Todos te admiramos, Vyse!\e"
MSp0040003,"\h(«Enrique»)Vyse, te he confiado el Delphinus. Cuídalo, a lo
mejor me lo tienes que devolver algún día.\c"
MSp0040004,"\h(«Enrique»)Como Príncipe de Valua, sabía que algún día
tendría que regresar allí, pero nunca hubiera
imaginado que lo haría desde abajo.\c"
MSp0040005,"\h(«Enrique»)Por fin hemos conseguido todos los Cristales
Lunares.
Por fin podemos poner fin a la tiranía de mi
madre.\e"
MSp0040006,"\h(«Enrique»)Aunque luchemos en bandos enemigos,
sigue siendo mi madre.\e"
MSp0040007,"\h(«Enrique»)Espero poder convencerla de que su equivocación
y que podamos alcanzar algún acuerdo.\c"
MSp0040008,\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… ¿Podría estar a solas un rato?\e
MSp0040015,"\h(«Enrique»)Las modificaciones del Delphinus deben haber
terminado. Vamos a volver al puerto, Vyse.\c"
MSp0040009,"\h(«Enrique»)Vamos, Vyse. No te preocupes, estaré bien.
No está entre mis planes morir tan joven.
¡Todavía tengo que gobernar un país!\e"
MSp0040010,"\h(«Enrique»)Sólo te pido una cosa, Vyse.
Mientras esté fuera, cuida…… de la Princesa
Moegi. Ella…… significa mucho para mí.\c"
MSp0040011,"\h(«Enrique»)Así que ha llegado el momento de enfrentarse a
Galcian. Iré con vosotros en el Delphinus.\e"
MSp0040012,"\h(«Enrique»)Galcian debe pagar por devastar mi país y matar
a mi madre…… y a Gregorio……\c"
MSp0040013,"\h(«Enrique»)Ha llegado el gran momento…… Si ganamos, en el
mundo reinará la paz. ¡Tenemos que ganar esta
batalla!\e"
MSp0040014,\h(«Enrique»)Vyse…… ¡Condúcenos a la victoria!\c
Ms017f000,"\h(«Vyse»)Gonzales… Your memory will always
be with us. Please watch over us
in our times of need…\c"
Ms017f001,"\h(«Vyse»)Gardens are vital to any sailor.
A lack of vegetables on any voyage can almost
guarantee death to the crew.\c"
Ms017f002,"\h(«Vyse»)Thanks to these guys,
we can eat fresh eggs every day.
And meat once in a while, too.\c"
Ms017f003,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… It'd be nice if we could build
a fountain right around here…\c"
Ms017f004,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow…
Izmael sure did a good job building
this fountain…\c"
Ms017f005,"\h(«Vyse»)It's hard to think that a girl like
Kirala made this fountain. It certainly
is… interesting.\c"
Ms017f006,"\h(«Vyse»)So this is the Cupil-shaped fountain
that Kirala made. Well, I'm sure at
least Fina likes it.\c"
Ms017f007,"\h(«Vyse»)For some reason, a lot of my crew members don't
like loqua, so we have a lot of juices and
nectars here. Maybe it's a little too bitter…\c"
Ms017f008,"\h(«Vyse»)We've got juices from all over the world and
an assortment of different loquas. Marco
insists that he get his own bottle of nectar…\c"
Ms017f009,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… Looks like stews for dinner tonight.
I'm sure nobody will mind if a have a taste…
Mmm! Pretty good!\c"
Ms017f010,"\h(«Vyse»)It looks like Urala has got some vegetables
sitting in this bean paste. It sure looks awful,
but it tastes great when it's done!\c"
Ms017f011,"\h(«Vyse»)Although Yafutoman condiments look a little
strange at first, they're actually quite good
once you get used to them.\c"
Ms017f012,"\h(«Vyse»)There's random piles
of Nasr rugs, small boxes
and other things.\c"
Ms017f013,"\h(«Vyse»)There's polished stones and
booklets with strange designs inside.
Maybe they're used for fortunetelling.\c"
Ms017f014,"\h(«Vyse»)The smoke smells kinda sweet. The smell's
getting stronger… My head's getting woozy…
Okay… maybe I should stop.\c"
Ms017f015,"\h(«Vyse»)There's salt on a small plate.
I wonder what this is for?\c"
Ms017f016,\h(«Vyse»)Maybe I'll rest for a little bit.\e
Ms017f017,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Take a short break.”
“Rest later.”\e"
Ms017f018,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, I'm not really that tired right now.
Resting can wait.\c"
Ms017f019,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh heh… Enrique's got a picture of
Moegi on his desk!\c"
Ms017f020,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh heh… Enrique's got a picture of
Moegi on his desk!\c"
Ms017f021,"\h(«Vyse»)Someone put my shirt in Enrique's chest
again. Whose turn was it to do
the laundry, anyway?\c"
Ms017f022,"\h(«Vyse»)This is Enrique's diary. Hmm… Nah, it would be
rude to read it. I'm sure there's plenty of
interesting things written in there, though.\c"
Ms017f023,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a picture of Moegi stuffed
inside this box! I think Enrique's in love…\c"
Ms017f024,"\h(«Vyse»)What's this? Aika's got a picture
of me on her desk.
That's kinda embarassing…\c"
Ms017f025,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! What exactly do you think you're doing?
Are you trying to go through my stuff?!\c"
Ms017f125,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a small bandana…
This is the one I gave her when we were kids.
Heh… I didn't know she still had it.\c"
Ms017f026,"\h(«Vyse»)It's Aika's diary…
If I opened it she'd probably
beat me to a pulp.\c"
Ms017f027,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! What exactly do you think you're doing?
Are you trying to go through my stuff?!\c"
Ms017f127,"\h(«Vyse»)There's a small bandana…
This is the one I gave her when we were kids.
Heh… I didn't know she still had it.\c"
Ms017f028,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a stuffed animal.
Aika has loved stuffed animals
ever since she was a kid.\c"
Ms017f029,"\h(«Vyse»)Why does Fina have a picture of me on her desk?
It's a little embarassing…\c"
Ms017f030,"\h(«Fina»)Um, Vyse…
I would appreciate it if you didn't
go through my stuff…\c"
Ms017f130,"\h(«Vyse»)I've always wondered why all of Fina's
clothes are white… Maybe that's just
how Silvites dress…\c"
Ms017f031,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina's mirror… I suppose it's just a little
strange seeing a mirror here… Not too many Air
Pirates care about the way they look, I guess.\c"
Ms017f032,"\h(«Fina»)Um, Vyse…
I would appreciate it if you didn't
go through my stuff…\c"
Ms017f132,"\h(«Vyse»)I've always wondered why all of Fina's
clothes are white… Maybe that's just
how Silvites dress…\c"
Ms017f033,"\h(«Vyse»)It's a book filled with random-looking lines
and badly written letters.\e"
Ms017f034,"\h(«Vyse»)I guess Marco's been trying hard to learn
how to write. Good for him…\c"
Ms017f035,"\h(«Vyse»)I love the smell of roasting sausages
by the fireplace…\c"
Ms017f036,"\h(«Vyse»)This must be the crew's sleeping area.
Once in a while, you can hear someone
fall out of their hammock at night.\c"
Ms017f037,"\h(«Vyse»)I love the smell of roasting sausages
by the fireplace…\c"
Ms017f038,"\h(«Vyse»)Some members of the crew sleep here.
Sometimes you can hear Marco talking
in his sleep… something about Flying Fish…\c"
Ms017f039,"\h(«Vyse»)I love the smell of grilled fish
coming from the fireplace… Makes me
hungry just thinking about it.\c"
Ms017f040,"\h(«Vyse»)This is where the crew sleeps. Even with these
bars, people still somehow manage to fall out
of their hammocks sometimes.\c"
Ms017f050,"\h(«Vyse»)It doesn't look like there's anyone here…
Well, it is a little late. Maybe I'll look
around a little bit more…\c"
Ms017f051,"\h(«Vyse»)Everyone's probably resting up for the big
battle tomorrow. I should probably let
them sleep…\c"
Ms017f052,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey… Aika's not here after all…
I wonder where she's gone off to…\c"
Ms017f053,"\h(«Vyse»)I wonder if Aika's gone to sleep yet…
Hmm… I probably shouldn't disturb her. She's
gonna need her rest for tomorrow's battle.\c"
Ms017f054,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina's not in her room…
I guess she isn't asleep after all.
I wonder where she is…\c"
Ms017f055,"\h(«Vyse»)I wonder if Fina's gone to sleep yet…
Hmm… I probably shouldn't disturb her. She's
gonna need her rest for tomorrow's battle.\c"
Ms017f056,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… It sounds like Enrique and Moegi are
talking. I probably shouldn't disturb them… I'm
sure they want to be alone…\c"
Ms017f057,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Stay up a little while longer.”
“Rest up for the big battle.”\e"
Ms017f058,"\h(«Vyse»)I think I'll stay up a little while longer. I
really don't think I could sleep right now if I
tried, anyway…\c"
Ms017f059,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, tomorrow's the big battle…
I should probably try and get some rest.\c"
Ms017f060,"\h(«Vyse»)It's sort of refreshing to see our flag flapping
in the wind like that…\e"
Ms017f061,"\h(«Change the flag?»)“Change it to Aika's design.”
“Change it to Fina's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017f062,"\h(«Change the flag?»)“Change it to my design.”
“Change it to Fina's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017f063,"\h(«Change the flag?»)“Change it to my design.”
“Change it to Aika's design.”
“Leave it the way it is.”\c"
Ms017f065,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, I heard a rumor concerning Dangral Island
a little while ago…\e"
Ms017f066,"\h(«Gilder»)According to my sources, Galcian's built some
sort of elevator that leads down beneath the
Great Cloud Sea…\e"
Ms017f067,"\h(«Aika»)Do you think they built it to try and get
to Soltis?!\e"
Ms017f068,"\h(«Gilder»)Probably. And I bet they're heading there with
the Moon Crystals as we speak.\e"
Ms017f069,"\h(«Vyse»)Well, then it looks like we know where we need
to go. Let's try and get to Soltis through
Dangral Island. We need to stop Galcian!\c"
Ms017f073,"\h( )This feeld belongs to evrybody! So you beter
not be taking any vegetubles without permishun!\e"
Ms017f074,"\h(«Vyse»)Hahaha… Looks like Marco made this sign. He's
been working so hard tending to the garden…
Heh… His spelling could still use some work…\c"
Ms017f075,"\h( )“Koketa Coop”
Crew members must take weekly
shifts to care for the Koketas.\c"
Ms017f076,"\h(«Vyse»)These are Koketa eggs. They've become a
regular part of our diet here. I like them
scrambled, but Aika likes them sunny-side up.\c"
Ms017f077,"\h(«What will you do?»)“Head for the Great Silver Shrine.”
“Stay here a little while longer.”\c"
Ms017f078,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm… I don't know if we should head to the
Great Silver Shrine right now. Besides, it's
getting a little late, anyway…\c"
MFs017f000,"\h(«Vyse»)Gonzales…… Nous ne t'oublierons jamais.
S'il te plaît, veille sur nous dans les moments
difficiles……\c"
MFs017f001,"\h(«Vyse»)Les marins ne peuvent pas vivre sans jardin.
Une pénurie de légumes pendant un voyage peut
presque décimer un équipage.\c"
MFs017f003,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…… Ce serait bien si nous pouvions construire
une fontaine par ici……\c"
MFs017f004,"\h(«Vyse»)Oaoouh……
Izmael a vraiment bien travaillé en construisant
cette fontaine……\c"
MFs017f005,"\h(«Vyse»)J'ai du mal à croire qu'une fille comme Kirala a
construit cette fontaine. C'est vraiment très……
intéressant.\c"
MFs017f006,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici donc la fontaine en forme de Cupil que
Kirala a construite. Hé bien, au moins je sais
qu'elle plaira à Fina.\c"
MFs017f007,"\h(«Vyse»)Une bonne partie de mon équipage n'apprécie pas
le loqua, c'est pourquoi nous avons plein de jus
et de nectars ici. Le loqua est peut-être trop
amer……\c"
MFs017f008,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous avons des jus du monde entier et un
assortiment de Loquas. Marco a insisté pour
avoir avoir sa propre bouteille de nectar……\c"
MFs017f009,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…… On dirait que ce soir il y a du ragoût
pour dîner. Je suis sûr que personne ne m'en
voudra si j'y goûte……
Mmm ! Plutôt bon !\c"
MFs017f011,"\h(«Vyse»)Bien que les condiments Yafutoman paraissent un
peu étranges au premier abord, ils sont en fait
assez bons quand on s'y habitue.\c"
MFs017f012,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a des piles de tapis de Nasr éparpillées,
des petites boîtes ainsi que d'autres choses.\c"
MFs017f013,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a des pierres polies et des manuels qui
contiennent d'étranges dessins.
On les utilisent peut-être pour dire la bonne
aventure.\c"
MFs017f014,"\h(«Vyse»)L'odeur de la fumée est plutôt douce. L'odeur
devient plus forte…… J'ai la tête qui tourne……
OK…… je devrais peut-être arrêter.\c"
MFs017f015,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a du sel sur une petite assiette.
Je me demande à quoi cela peut bien servir ?\c"
MFs017f016,\h(«Vyse»)Je me reposerai peut-être un peu.\e
MFs017f017,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“Vous ferez une petite pause.”
“Vous vous reposerez plus tard.”\e"
MFs017f018,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh bien, je ne suis pas si fatigué maintenant.
Le repos peut attendre.\c"
MFs017f019,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé hé…… Enrique a une photo de Moegi sur son
bureau !\c"
MFs017f020,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé hé…… Enrique a une photo de Moegi sur son
bureau !\c"
MFs017f021,"\h(«Vyse»)Quelqu'un a de nouveau mis ma chemise dans la
commode d'Enrique. Qui était chargé de faire la
lessive ?\c"
MFs017f022,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici le journal d'Enrique. Hmm…… Nah, Il serait
très impoli de le lire. Cependant, je suis sûr
qu'il y a plein de choses intéressantes à lire
là-dedans.\c"
MFs017f023,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a une photo de Moegi dans cette boîte !
Je crois qu'Enrique est amoureux……\c"
MFs017f024,"\h(«Vyse»)Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
Aika a une photo de moi sur son bureau.
C'est plutôt gênant……\c"
MFs017f125,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a un petit bandana……
C'est celui que je lui ai donné quand nous
étions enfants. Hé…… Je ne savais pas qu'elle
l'avait toujours.\c"
MFs017f026,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici le journal d'Aika……
Si je l'ouvre elle me reduira probablement en
bouillie.\c"
MFs017f027,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse ! Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
Es-tu en train de fouiller dans mes affaires ?!\c"
MFs017f127,"\h(«Vyse»)Il y a un petit bandana……
C'est celui que je lui ai donné quand nous
étions enfants. Hé…… Je ne savais pas qu'elle
l'avait toujours.\c"
MFs017f028,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est un animal empaillé.
Aika a toujours adoré les animaux empaillés.\c"
MFs017f030,"\h(«Fina»)Um, Vyse……
J'aimerais bien que tu ne fouilles pas dans mes
affaires……\c"
MFs017f130,"\h(«Vyse»)Je me suis toujours demandé pourquoi tous les
vêtements de Fina étaient blancs…… C'est peut-
être une mode Silvite……\c"
MFs017f031,"\h(«Vyse»)Le miroir de Fina…… C'est un peu étrange de
voir un miroir ici…… Les Pirates de l'Air qui se
soucient de leur apparence sont peu nombreux.\c"
MFs017f032,"\h(«Fina»)Um, Vyse……
J'aimerais bien que tu ne fouilles pas dans mes
affaires……\c"
MFs017f132,"\h(«Vyse»)Je me suis toujours demandé pourquoi tous les
vêtements de Fina étaient blancs…… C'est peut-
être à la mode chez les Silvites……\c"
MFs017f033,"\h(«Vyse»)Voici un livre avec des lignes écrites dans
tous les sens et des lettres mal formées.\e"
MFs017f034,"\h(«Vyse»)Marco doit s'efforcer d'apprendre à écrire.
C'est bien……\c"
MFs017f035,"\h(«Vyse»)J'adore l'odeur des saucisses grillées au feu de
bois……\c"
MFs017f036,"\h(«Vyse»)Ce doit être l'endroit où l'équipage dort.
De temps en temps, on entend quelqu'un
tomber de son hamac dans la nuit.\c"
MFs017f037,"\h(«Vyse»)J'adore l'odeur des saucisses grillées au feu de
bois……\c"
MFs017f038,"\h(«Vyse»)Certains membres de l'équipage dorment ici.
Parfois on entend Marco parler dans son
sommeil…… il est question de poissons volants……\c"
MFs017f039,"\h(«Vyse»)J'adore l'odeur du poisson grillé au feu de
bois…… Quand j'y pense cela me donne faim.\c"
MFs017f040,"\h(«Vyse»)Ceci est l'endroit où l'équipage dort.
Même avec ces barres, les marins arrivent à
tomber de leur hamac de temps en temps.\c"
MFs017f050,"\h(«Vyse»)On dirait qu'il n'y a personne ici……
Bon, il est un peu tard. Je vais peut-être
explorer les environs un peu plus longtemps……\c"
MFs017f051,"\h(«Vyse»)Tout le monde doit se reposer pour la
grande bataille de demain. Je devrais les
laisser dormir……\c"
MFs017f052,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé…… Aika n'est pas ici……
Je me demande où elle a bien pu aller……\c"
MFs017f053,"\h(«Vyse»)Je me demande si Aika est déjà allée se
coucher……
Hmm…… Je ne devrais pas la déranger. Elle a
besoin de repos avant la bataille de demain.\c"
MFs017f054,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina n'est pas dans sa cabine……
Donc, elle ne doit pas dormir.
Je me demande où elle est……\c"
MFs017f055,"\h(«Vyse»)Je me demande si Fina est dèjà couchée……
Hmm…… Je ne devrais pas la déranger. Elle a
besoin de se reposer avant la bataille de
demain.\c"
MFs017f056,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…… On dirait qu'Enrique et Moegi discutent.
Je ne devrais pas les déranger…… Je suis sûr
qu'ils veulent rester seuls……\c"
MFs017f057,"\h(«Que ferez-vous ?»)“Vous resterez éveillé un peu plus longtemps.”
“Vous vous reposerez pour la grande bataille.”\e"
MFs017f058,"\h(«Vyse»)Je pense que je ne vais pas me coucher de suite.
De toute façon, même si j'essayais, je ne pense
vraiment pas que je pourrais dormir……\c"
MFs017f059,"\h(«Vyse»)Bon, la grande bataille, c'est demain……
Je devrais essayer de me reposer un peu.\c"

flotter au gré du vent……\e"

MFs017f065,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, il n'y a pas très longtemps, j'ai entendu
des rumeurs au sujet de l'Île de Dangral……\e"
MFs017f066,"\h(«Gilder»)Selon mes sources, Galcian a construit un genre
d'ascenseur qui descend sous le Grand Océan de
Nuages……\e"
MFs017f067,"\h(«Aika»)Crois-tu qu'ils l'ont construit pour essayer
de se rendre à Soltis ?!\e"
MFs017f068,"\h(«Gilder»)Probablement. Et je parie, qu'au moment où je te
parle, ils sont déjà en chemin avec les Cristaux
de Lune.\e"
MFs017f069,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh bien, alors on dirait que nous savons où nous
devons aller. Essayons de nous rendre sur Soltis
en passant par l'Île de Dangral. Nous devons
arrêter Galcian !\c"
MFs017f073,"\h( )Ce chen appartien a tout le monde ! Alors vous
n'aver pas interet a prendre des légumes sans
permicion !\e"
MFs017f074,"\h(«Vyse»)Ha ha ha…… On dirait que Marco a écrit cette
pancarte. Il s'occupe du jardin tellement bien……

orthographe……\c"

pour Le Grand Temple d'Argent immédiatement.
En plus, il se fait un peu tard……\c"
MGs017f000,"\h(«Vyse»)Gonzales…… Du wirst immer in unserer
Erinnerung bleiben. Bitte wache über uns
in Zeiten der Not……\c"
MGs017f001,"\h(«Vyse»)Gärten sind sehr wichtig für Seefahrer.
Ein Mangel an Gemüse auf einer Reise
kann ohne weiteres den Tod für die
ganze Crew bedeuten.\c"
MGs017f002,"\h(«Vyse»)Dank diesen Jungs
können wir jeden Tag frische Eier
essen. Und ab und zu auch Fleisch.\c"

hier einen Springbrunnen bauen könnten…… \c"
MGs017f004,"\h(«Vyse»)Wow……
Izmael hat gute Arbeit geleistet, als er
diesen Springbrunnen baute……\c"
MGs017f005,"\h(«Vyse»)Es ist schwierig, sich vorzustellen, dass
ein Mädchen wie Kirala diesen Springbrunnen
gebaut hat. Es ist wirklich…… interessant.\c"
MGs017f006,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist also der cupilförmige
Springbrunnen, den Kirala gemacht hat.
Nun ja, ich bin mir sicher, dass ihn wenigstens
Fina mag.\c"
MGs017f007,"\h(«Vyse»)Aus irgendeinem Grund mögen einige in meiner

MGs017f009,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…… Sieht so aus, als gebe es Eintopf
zum Abendessen. Bin mir sicher, niemand hat
was dagegen, wenn ich mal probiere……
Mmm! Ziemlich gut!\c"
MGs017f010,"\h(«Vyse»)Sieht so aus, als habe Urala Gemüse
in den Bohnenaufstrich gemengt. Er sieht
wirklich widerlich aus, aber er schmeckt klasse,
wenn er fertig ist!\c"
MGs017f011,"\h(«Vyse»)Obwohl yafutomanische Würze zuerst ein
bisschen seltsam aussieht, ist sie ziemlich
gut, wenn du dich dran gewöhnt hast.\c"
MGs017f012,"\h(«Vyse»)Wahllose Haufen von
nasrischen Teppichen, kleinen Kisten
und anderen Sachen.\c"
MGs017f013,"\h(«Vyse»)Polierte Steine und Broschüren
mit seltsamen Mustern. Vielleicht werden
die zum Wahrsagen gebraucht.\c"
MGs017f014,"\h(«Vyse»)Der Rauch riecht irgendwie süß. Der Geruch
wird stärker…… Mir wird ganz schwindelig……
Ok…… vielleicht sollte ich aufhören.\c"
MGs017f015,"\h(«Vyse»)Da ist Salz auf einem kleinen Teller.
Ich frage mich, wofür das ist?\c"
MGs017f016,\h(«Vyse»)Vielleicht ruhe ich mich für einen Moment aus.\e
MGs017f017,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Eine Pause machen.”
“Später pausieren.”\e"
MGs017f018,"\h(«Vyse»)Nun ja, ich bin noch nicht
richtig müde. Die Pause kann warten.\c"
MGs017f019,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh heh…… Enrique hat ein Bild
von Moegi auf seinem Schreibtisch!\c"
MGs017f020,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh heh…… Enrique hat ein Bild
von Moegi auf seinem Schreibtisch!\c"
MGs017f021,"\h(«Vyse»)Jemand hat mein Hemd wieder in
Enriques Kommode gelegt. Wer war denn
überhaupt mit dem Waschen dran?\c"
MGs017f022,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist Enriques Tagebuch. Hmm……
Nah, es wäre unverschämt, es zu lesen.
Ich bin mir allerdings sicher, dass da alle
möglichen interessanten Sachen drin stehen.\c"
MGs017f023,"\h(«Vyse»)Da ist ein Bild von Moegi in der Kiste!
Enrique ist wohl verliebt……\c"
MGs017f024,"\h(«Vyse»)Was ist das? Aika hat ein Bild von mir
auf ihrem Schreibtisch. Das ist irgendwie
peinlich……\c"
MGs017f025,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! Was machst du da?
Versuchst du, in meinen Sachen zu schnüffeln?!\c"
MGs017f125,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein Halstuch…… Das hab ich ihr geschenkt,
als wir klein waren. Heh…… Ich wusste nicht,
dass sie es immer noch hat.\c"
MGs017f026,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist Aikas Tagebuch……
Wenn ich es öffnen würde, würde
sie mich wahrscheinlich zu Brei schlagen.\c"
MGs017f027,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse! Was machst du da?
Versuchst du, in meinen Sachen zu schnüffeln?!\c"
MGs017f127,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein Halstuch…… Das hab ich ihr geschenkt,
als wir klein waren. Heh…… Ich wusste nicht,
dass sie es immer noch hat.\c"
MGs017f028,"\h(«Vyse»)Das ist ein Stofftier. Aika liebt Stofftiere
seit ihrer frühesten Kindheit.\c"
MGs017f029,"\h(«Vyse»)Warum hat Fina ein Bild von mir auf
ihrem Schreibtisch?
Das ist irgendwie peinlich……\c"
MGs017f030,"\h(«Fina»)Mm, Vyse……
Ich wäre dir dankbar, wenn du meine
Sachen in Ruhe lassen würdest……\c"
MGs017f130,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich hab' mich immer schon gewundert, warum
Finas Kleider alle weiß sind……
Vielleicht kleiden sich Silviterinnen so……\c"
MGs017f031,"\h(«Vyse»)Finas Spiegel…… Schätze, es ist nur ein
bisschen sonderbar, hier einen Spiegel
zu sehen…… Nicht gerade viele Luftpiraten
kümmern sich um ihr Äußeres, schätz' ich.\c"
MGs017f032,"\h(«Fina»)Mm, Vyse……
Ich wäre dir dankbar, wenn du meine
Sachen in Ruhe lassen würdest……\c"
MGs017f132,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich hab' mich immer schon gewundert, warum
Finas Kleider alle weiß sind……
Vielleicht kleiden sich Silviterinnen so……\c"
MGs017f033,"\h(«Vyse»)Ein Buch mit wahllos aussehenden
Linien und schlecht geschriebenen Buchstaben.\e"
MGs017f034,"\h(«Vyse»)Marco hat wohl versucht, schreiben
zu lernen. Gut für ihn……\c"
MGs017f035,\h(«Vyse»)Ich liebe den Geruch von Bratwürsten am Feuer……\c
MGs017f036,"\h(«Vyse»)Das müssen die Kojen der Crew sein.
Manchmal hörst du jemanden in der Nacht
aus seiner Hängematte fallen.\c"
MGs017f037,\h(«Vyse»)Ich liebe den Geruch von Bratwürsten am Feuer……\c
MGs017f038,"\h(«Vyse»)Einige von der Crew schlafen hier.
Manchmal kannst du  Marco im Schlaf sprechen
hören…… irgend etwas über fliegende Fische……\c"
MGs017f039,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich liebe den Geruch von gegrilltem
Fisch, wenn er vom Herd kommt……
Macht mich ganz hungrig, wenn ich
nur dran denke……\c"
MGs017f040,"\h(«Vyse»)Hier schläft die Crew. Trotz der
Stangen schaffen es die Leute immer
noch, aus ihren Hängematten zu fallen.\c"
MGs017f050,"\h(«Vyse»)Scheint niemand hier zu sein……
Nun ja, es ist ein bisschen spät. Vielleicht
gucke ich mich noch ein bisschen um……\c"
MGs017f051,"\h(«Vyse»)Die ruhen sich wahrscheinlich alle für die
große Schlacht morgen aus. Ich sollte sie
besser schlafen lassen……\c"
MGs017f052,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey…… Aika ist nicht hier……
Ich frage mich, wo sie ist……\c"
MGs017f053,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich frage mich, ob Aika schon zu Bett
gegangen ist…… Hmm…… Ich sollte
sie besser nicht stören. Sie braucht die Ruhe
für die morgige Schlacht.\c"
MGs017f054,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina ist nicht auf ihrem Zimmer……
Sie schläft wohl doch noch nicht.
Ich frage mich, wo sie ist……\c"
MGs017f055,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich frage mich, ob Fina schon zu Bett
gegangen ist…… Hmm…… Ich sollte sie
besser nicht stören. Sie braucht die Ruhe
für die morgige Schlacht.\c"
MGs017f056,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…… Klingt, als unterhielten sich
Enrique und Moegi. Ich sollte sie nicht stören……
sie wollen sicher allein sein……\c"
MGs017f057,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“Eine Weile wach bleiben.”
“Dich für die große Schlacht ausruhen.”\e"
MGs017f058,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich bleibe noch ein bisschen
wach. Ich glaube, ich könnte nicht schlafen,
selbst wenn ich es versuchen würde……\c"
MGs017f059,"\h(«Vyse»)Nun ja, morgen ist die große Schlacht……
Ich sollte versuchen ein wenig auszuruhen.\c"
MGs017f060,"\h(«Vyse»)Irgendwie erfrischend, unsere Flagge so
im Wind flattern zu sehen……\e"
MGs017f061,"\h(«Flagge tauschen?»)“Flagge gegen Aikas Design tauschen.”
“Flagge gegen Finas Design tauschen.”
“So lassen wie sie ist.”\c"

“Flagge gegen Aikas Design tauschen.”
“So lassen wie sie ist.”\c"
MGs017f065,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, Ich hab' vor einer Weile ein
Gerücht über Dangral Island gehört……\e"
MGs017f066,"\h(«Gilder»)Nach meinen Quellen hat Galcian eine Art
Aufzug gebaut, der unter die
Great Cloud Sea führt……\e"
MGs017f067,"\h(«Aika»)Glaubst du, die haben den gebaut, um
nach Soltis zu gelangen?!\e"
MGs017f068,"\h(«Gilder»)Wahrscheinlich. Und ich wette, die
sind mit den Moon Crystals auf dem
Weg dorthin, während wir hier reden.\e"
MGs017f069,"\h(«Vyse»)Nun ja, dann wissen wir ja, wo wir hinmüssen.
Lass uns versuchen, durch Dangral Island nach
Soltis zu gelangen.
Wir müssen Galcian stoppen!\c"
MGs017f073,"\h( )Dieses Beeht gehört jedemm! Also nim
dir ja keine Gemüsse one Erlaubniss!\e"
MGs017f074,"\h(«Vyse»)Hahaha…… Scheint, als habe Marco dieses Schild
geschrieben. Er gibt sich so viel Mühe mit der
Gartenarbeit……  Heh…… seine Rechtschreibung
braucht allerdings noch ein bisschen Übung……\c"
MGs017f075,"\h( )“Koketa Coop”
Mitglieder der Crew müssen wöchentliche
Schichten übernehmen, um sich um
die Coquetas zu kümmern.\c"
MGs017f076,"\h(«Vyse»)Das sind Koketa-Eier. Sie sind ein
Bestandteil unserer Nahrung. Ich mag sie
als Rühreier, Aika bevorzugt sie als
Spiegeleier.\c"
MGs017f077,"\h(«Was wirst du tun?»)“In Richtung Great Silver Shrine aufbrechen.”
“Eine Weile hier bleiben.”\c"
MGs017f078,"\h(«Vyse»)Hmm…… Ich weiß nicht, ob wir
gerade jetzt in Richtung Great Silver Shrine
aufbrechen sollten. Es ist schon ein
bisschen spät……\c"
MSs017f000,"\h(«Vyse»)González, tu memoria siempre estará
con nosotros. Cuida de nosotros
en momentos de necesidad.\c"
MSs017f001,"\h(«Vyse»)Los jardines son vitales para los marinos.
La escasez de verduras en un viaje puede
significar la muerte de la tripulación.\c"
MSs017f002,"\h(«Vyse»)Gracias a estos tipo, podemos comer
huevos frescos todos los días y carne
de vez en cuando.\c"
MSs017f003,"\h(«Vyse»)Mmm…… Estaría bien que construyéramos
una fuente justo aquí.\c"
MSs017f004,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Vaya!
Sin duda, Izmael ha hecho
un fantástico trabajo con esta fuente.\c"
MSs017f005,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece increíble que una chica
como Kirala haya hecho esta fuente.
En verdad es…… interesante.\c"
MSs017f006,"\h(«Vyse»)Así que ésta es la fuente con forma
de Cupido que hizo Kirala.
Seguro que a Fina le gusta.\c"
MSs017f007,"\h(«Vyse»)A gran parte de mi tripulación no le gusta
el loqua, así que tenemos muchos zumos y
néctares. Será por su amargor.\c"
MSs017f008,"\h(«Vyse»)Tenemos zumos de todas partes del mundo y
una selección de loquas. Marco insiste en
que quiere su propia botella de néctar.\c"
MSs017f009,"\h(«Vyse»)Mmm…… Parece que hay estofado para cenar.
Seguro que a nadie le importa que lo pruebe.
¡Mmm! ¡Qué bueno!\c"
MSs017f010,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece que Urala ha puesto algunas verduras
en este concentrado de judías. Tiene una
pinta horrorosa, pero está buenísimo.\c"
MSs017f011,"\h(«Vyse»)Aunque los condimentos Yafutoman son
muy extraños a primera vista, están muy
buenos cuando te acostumbras a comerlos.\c"
MSs017f012,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay montones de alfombras de Nasr,
cajas pequeñas y otras cosas.\c"
MSs017f013,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay piedras pulidas y libros con dibujos
extraños. Quizás los usan para predecir
el futuro.\c"
MSs017f014,"\h(«Vyse»)El humo tiene un aroma dulce. El olor es
cada vez más fuerte. Me estoy mareando.
Supongo que debería parar.\c"
MSs017f015,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay sal en un plato pequeño.
¿Me pregunto para qué será?\c"
MSs017f016,\h(«Vyse»)Creo que voy a descansar un rato.\e
MSs017f017,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Tomarme un pequeño descanso.”
“Descansar más tarde.”\e"
MSs017f018,"\h(«Vyse»)Bueno, no estoy tan cansado ahora mismo.
Ya descansaré en otro momento.\c"
MSs017f019,"\h(«Vyse»)Je, je……
¡Enrique tiene una foto de Moegi en su mesa!\c"
MSs017f020,"\h(«Vyse»)Je, je……
¡Enrique tiene una foto de Moegi en su mesa!\c"
MSs017f021,"\h(«Vyse»)Alguien puso mi camisa en el cofre de
Enrique otra vez. ¿A quién le tocaba
hacer la colada esta vez?\c"
MSs017f022,"\h(«Vyse»)Éste es el diario de Enrique. Mmm……
No estaría bien leerlo, aunque seguro
que tiene muchas cosas interesantes.\c"
MSs017f023,"\h(«Vyse»)¡Hay una foto de Moegi metida en esta caja!
Creo que Enrique está enamorado……\c"
MSs017f024,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Qué es esto?
¡¿Aika tiene una foto mía en su mesa?!
Me da mucha vergüenza……\c"
MSs017f025,"\h(«Aika»)¡Vyse! ¿Qué estás haciendo?
¡¿Estás revolviendo en mis cosas?!\c"
MSs017f125,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay un pañuelo para la cabeza pequeño.
Es el que le di a ella cuando éramos
pequeños. No sabía que todavía lo tenía.\c"
MSs017f026,"\h(«Vyse»)Es el diario de Aika……
Si lo abriera, seguro me daría
una tremenda paliza.\c"
MSs017f027,"\h(«Aika»)¡Vyse! ¿Qué estás haciendo?
¡¿Estás revolviendo en mis cosas?!\c"
MSs017f127,"\h(«Vyse»)Hay un pañuelo para la cabeza pequeño.
Es el que le di a ella cuando éramos
pequeños. No sabía que todavía lo tenía.\c"
MSs017f028,"\h(«Vyse»)Es un animal disecado.
A Aika siempre le han gustado los animales
disecados, desde que era pequeña.\c"
MSs017f029,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Por qué Fina tiene una foto mía en su mesa?
Me da un poco de vergüenza……\c"
MSs017f030,"\h(«Fina»)Eh, Vyse……
Te agradecería que no volvieras a hurgar
entre mis cosas……\c"
MSs017f130,"\h(«Vyse»)Siempre me he preguntado porqué
toda la ropa de Fina es blanca……
Quizá los Silvites visten así.\c"
MSs017f031,"\h(«Vyse»)El espejo de Fina…… Supongo que es extraño
ver un espejo aquí. No hay muchos Piratas
Aéreos que se preocupen por su apariencia.\c"
MSs017f032,"\h(«Fina»)Eh, Vyse……
Te agradecería que no volvieras a hurgar
entre mis cosas……\c"
MSs017f132,"\h(«Vyse»)Siempre me he preguntado porqué
toda la ropa de Fina es blanca……
Quizá los Silvites visten así.\c"
MSs017f033,"\h(«Vyse»)Es un libro lleno de frases con una pinta
muy rara y letras mal escritas.\e"
MSs017f034,"\h(«Vyse»)Me imagino que Marco ha estado aprendiendo
a escribir. Me alegro por él.\c"
MSs017f035,"\h(«Vyse»)Me encanta el olor de las salchichas chamuscadas
en la barbacoa.\c"
MSs017f036,"\h(«Vyse»)Ésta debe de ser la zona donde duerme la
tripulación. De vez en cuando, se oye cómo se
cae alguien de la hamaca por la noche.\c"
MSs017f037,"\h(«Vyse»)Me encanta el olor de las salchichas chamuscadas
en la barbacoa.\c"
MSs017f038,"\h(«Vyse»)Algunos miembros de la tripulación duermen
aquí. A veces se oye a Marco hablando en
sueños, diciendo algo de un Pez Volador……\c"
MSs017f039,"\h(«Vyse»)Me encanta el olor de pescado a la parrilla.
Me da hambre sólo de pensarlo.\c"
MSs017f040,"\h(«Vyse»)Aquí es donde duerme la tripulación.
Incluso con estas barras, la gente se sigue
cayendo de las hamacas de vez en cuando.\c"
MSs017f050,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece que no hay nadie aquí……
Bueno, es un poco tarde.
Quizá siga echando un vistazo……\c"
MSs017f051,"\h(«Vyse»)Todo el mundo debe de estar descansando
para la gran batalla de mañana.
Debería dejarles dormir……\c"
MSs017f052,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh, Aika no está aquí después de todo.
¿A dónde habrá ido……?\c"
MSs017f053,"\h(«Vyse»)Me pregunto si Aika se habrá ido a dormir ya……
Mmm…… No debería molestarla. Necesita
descansar para la batalla de mañana.\c"
MSs017f054,"\h(«Vyse»)Fina no está en su habitación……
Supongo que no está durmiendo después de todo.
¿Dónde estará?\c"
MSs017f055,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Se habrá ido ya a dormir Fina?
Mmm…… No debería molestarla. Necesita
descansar para la batalla de mañana.\c"
MSs017f056,"\h(«Vyse»)Parece que Enrique y Moegi están hablando.
No debería molestarles.
Seguro que quieren estar solos.\c"
MSs017f057,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Estar despierto un rato más.”
“Descansar para la gran batalla.”\e"
MSs017f058,"\h(«Vyse»)Creo que me quedaré despierto un rato más.
No creo que pueda dormir ahora mismo.\c"
MSs017f059,"\h(«Vyse»)Bueno, mañana es la gran batalla……
Creo que debería intentar dormir un poco.\c"
MSs017f060,"\h(«Vyse»)Es reconfortante ver de nuevo nuestra bandera
ondeando en el viento.\c"

MSs017f065,"\h(«Gilder»)Vyse, hace tiempo oí un rumor sobre Isla
Dangral……\e"
MSs017f066,"\h(«Gilder»)Según mis fuentes, Galcian ha construido una
especie de ascensor que te lleva más allá del
mar de Grandes Nubes.\e"
MSs017f067,"\h(«Aika»)¡¿Crees que lo construyeron en un intento
de llegar a Soltis?!\e"
MSs017f068,"\h(«Gilder»)Probablemente. Y seguro que mientras hablamos
ya están de camino con los Cristales Lunares.\e"
MSs017f069,"\h(«Vyse»)Bueno, parece que ya sabemos dónde tenemos que
ir. Intentemos llegar a Soltis por Isla Dangral.
¡Debemos detener a Galcian!\c"
MSs017f073,"\h( )｡Este terreno pertenece a todo el mundo!
｡Espero que no se te ocurra llevarte ni una de
estas verduras sin permiso!\e"
MSs017f074,"\h(«Vyse»)Ah…… Parece que Marco hizo esta señal.
Ha trabajado mucho cuidando su jardín,
pero debería trabajar más su ortografía.\c"
MSs017f075,"\h( )“Granja de Koketa”
Los miembros de la tripulación deben turnarse
semanalmente para cuidar de las Koketas.\c"
MSs017f076,"\h(«Vyse»)Estos son huevos de Koketa. Son un alimento
fundamental de nuestra dieta. A mí me gustan
revueltos, pero a Aika le gustan al plato.\c"
MSs017f077,"\h(«¿Qué vas a hacer?»)“Partir hacia el Gran Relicario de Plata.”
“Quedarme aquí un poco más.”\c"
MSs017f078,"\h(«Vyse»)Mmm…… No sé si deberíamos salir hacia
el Gran Relicario de Plata ahora mismo.
Además, se está haciendo tarde……\c"
MJ0220000,"\h(«Vyse»)Modifications to the Delphinus began on that
day.\e"
MJ0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)We needed 10 days to complete our preparations.
Crescent Isle began to bustle with activity…\e"
MJ0220002,"\h(«Vyse»)Using the blueprints that we took from Valua, 
Brabham was hard at work rebuilding the engine
of the Delphinus.\e"
MJ0220003,"\h(«Vyse»)I can't wait to see what Deep Sky looks like 
with my own eyes.\e"
MJ0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)Far beneath the great, blue sky… beneath the 
clouds… I imagine that the atmospheric
pressure must be high…\e"
MJ0220005,"\h(«Vyse»)We must reinforce the Delphinus' hull to make 
sure that it doesn't collapse under the 
pressure…\e"
MJ0220006,"\h(«Vyse»)Ever since that day…
Enrique began to spend more and more time by 
himself.\e"
MJ0220007,"\h(«Vyse»)Looking back…
Losing Gregorio must have been the hardest thing
Enrique has ever faced…\e"
MJ0220008,"\h(«Vyse»)And then, on the tenth day, night fell on 
Crescent Isle… I remember lying awake in my bed
for a long time before I finally fell asleep.\e"
MJ0220009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ugh… I still don't feel rested. Maybe because I
stayed up all night the day before yesterday 
working on the Delphinus…\e"
MJ0220010,"\h(«Vyse»)I should head over to the port.
If everything went according to schedule, 
the modifications should be finished by now.\e"
MFJ0220000,"\h(«Vyse»)Les modifications du Delphinus débutèrent ce
jour là.\e"
MFJ0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)Il nous fallait dix jours pour terminer nos
préparations. Tout le monde s'activait sur l'Île
Croissant……\e"
MFJ0220002,"\h(«Vyse»)Grâce aux schémas que nous avions pris à Valua,
Brabham travaillait dur à la reconstruction du
moteur du Delphinus.\e"
MFJ0220003,"\h(«Vyse»)Il me tarde de voir les Profondeurs de mes
propres yeux……\e"
MFJ0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)Loin sous le grand ciel bleu…… sous les
nuages…… j'imagine que la pression atmosphérique
doit être très élevée……\e"
MFJ0220005,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous devons renforcer la coque du Delphinus pour
qu'il ne s'effondre pas sous la pression……\e"
MFJ0220006,"\h(«Vyse»)Depuis ce jour là……
Enrique se mis à passer de plus en plus de temps
tout seul.\e"
MFJ0220007,"\h(«Vyse»)Quand j'y repense……
Cela a dû être très dur pour Enrique de perdre
Gregorio……\e"
MFJ0220008,"\h(«Vyse»)Et puis, le dixième jour, la nuit tomba sur
l'Île Croissant…… Je me souviens être resté
longtemps allongé sur mon lit avant de pouvoir
m'endormir.\e"
MFJ0220009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ugh…… Je ne me sens pas reposé. C'est peut-être
parce que j'ai passé toute la nuit d'avant à
travailler sur le Delphinus……\e"
MFJ0220010,"\h(«Vyse»)Je devrais rentrer au port.
Si tout se passe comme prévu,
les modifications devraient être terminées.\e"
MGJ0220000,"\h(«Vyse»)Die Arbeiten an der Delphinus begannen an
jenem Tag.\e"
MGJ0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir brauchten 10 Tage, um unsere Vorbereitungen
zu treffen. Auf Crescent Isle
begann fieberhafte Aktivität……\e"
MGJ0220002,"\h(«Vyse»)Unter Verwendung der Pläne, die wir aus Valua
mitgebracht hatten, tat Brabham, was er konnte,
die Motoren der Delphinus zu modifizieren.\e"
MGJ0220003,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich kann's kaum erwarten, mit eigenen Augen
zu sehen, wie Deep Sky aussieht……\e"
MGJ0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)Tief unter dem riesigen, blauen Himmel……
ich kann mir jetzt schon vorstellen, dass
der atmosphärische Druck gewaltig sein muss……\e"
MGJ0220005,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir müssen den Rumpf der Delphinus verstärken,
um sicherzustellen, dass sie nicht unter dem
Druck auseinanderbricht……\e"
MGJ0220006,"\h(«Vyse»)Seit jenem Tag……
……zog es Enrique vor, immer mehr Zeit
allein zu verbringen.\e"
MGJ0220007,"\h(«Vyse»)Wenn man so zurückblickt……
Gregorio zu verlieren, muss das Schlimmste
gewesen sein, was Enrique je widerfahren ist……\e"
MGJ0220008,"\h(«Vyse»)Und dann, am 10. Tag, als es Nacht wurde in
Crescent Isle……  Ich erinnere mich, noch lange
wach gelegen zu haben, bevor ich endlich
einschlief.\e"
MGJ0220009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ach je…… ich bin immer noch nicht ausgeruht.
Vielleicht, weil ich vorgestern die ganze
Nacht wach war, um an der Delphinus zu
arbeiten……\e"
MGJ0220010,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich sollte mal zum Hafen hinunter gehen.
Wenn alles nach Plan verlaufen ist, müssten
die Modifikationen jetzt abgeschlossen sein.\e"
MSJ0220000,"\h(«Vyse»)Las modificaciones del Delphinus empezaron ese
mismo día.\e"
MSJ0220001,"\h(«Vyse»)Se necesitaban 10 días para acabar los
preparativos. La Isla de la Luna bullía de
actividad……\e"
MSJ0220002,"\h(«Vyse»)Usando los planos que nos llevamos de Valua,
Brabham se dedicó duramente a reconstruir el
motor del Delphinus.\e"
MSJ0220003,"\h(«Vyse»)Estoy impaciente por ver lo que hay en el Cielo
Profundo con mis propios ojos……\e"
MSJ0220004,"\h(«Vyse»)Más abajo del inmenso cielo azul…… por debajo de
las nubes…… Me imagino que la presión
atmosférica será bastante alta……\e"
MSJ0220005,"\h(«Vyse»)Tenemos que reforzar el casco del Delphinus para
asegurarnos de que no se desploma con la
presión……\e"
MSJ0220006,"\h(«Vyse»)A partir de ese día……
Enrique empezó a pasar cada vez más tiempo en
solitario.\e"
MSJ0220007,"\h(«Vyse»)Cuando ahora pienso en ello……
Me doy cuenta de que perder a Gregorio debió ser
lo más duro que le había sucedido……\e"
MSJ0220008,"\h(«Vyse»)Y entonces, en el décimo día, la noche se cernió
sobre la Isla de la Luna…… Recuerdo que pasé
mucho tiempo en la cama tumbado antes de poder
dormirme.\e"
MSJ0220009,"\h(«Vyse»)Ah…… Todavía no he descansado. A lo mejor es
porque anteayer pasé toda la noche despierto
trabajando en el Delphinus……\e"
MSJ0220010,"\h(«Vyse»)Debería ir hacia el puerto.
Si todo ha ido de acuerdo con lo planeado, las
modificaciones deben haber terminado.\e"
ML0040000,\h(«Vyse»)…Who could it be at this time of night?\e
ML0040001,"\h( )It's me, Vyse.\e"
ML0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)Belleza?
What are you doing up at this time of…\e"
ML0040003,"\h(«Belleza»)I…
I've come to say goodbye.\e"
ML0040004,"\h(«Vyse»)Goodbye?!
You're not going to fight with us?\e"
ML0040005,"\h(«Belleza»)I'm afraid not.
You can't expect me to fight my own men.\e"
ML0040006,"\h(«Belleza»)And besides…
There's something else that I have to take care 
of.\e"
ML0040007,\h(«Vyse»)Something else?\e
ML0040008,\h(«Belleza»)……\e
ML0040009,"\h(«Belleza»)…That reminds me.
I took a peek into Aika and Fina's rooms
earlier.\e"
ML0040010,\h(«Belleza»)Neither of them were there.\e
ML0040011,\h(«Vyse»)Huh? Are you serious?\e
ML0040012,"\h(«Belleza»)They were probably unable to sleep… You know…
the night before a battle… They aren't as tough
as they pretend to be… \e"
ML0040013,\h(«Belleza»)A good captain would find them and comfort them.\e
ML0040014,"\h(«Vyse»)Heh, alright.
I'll go check up on them.\e"
ML0040015,\h(«Belleza»)Heh heh… I figured you would.\e
ML0040016,"\h(«Belleza»)Well then…
I must be on my way.\e"
ML0040017,"\h(«Belleza»)I know you'll grow to be a great leader. 
And try not to break too many hearts. 
Goodbye, Vyse.\e"
MFL0040000,\h(«Vyse»)……Qui ça peut bien être à cette heure-ci ?\e
MFL0040001,"\h( )C'est moi, Vyse.\e"
MFL0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)Belleza ?
Que faites-vous debout à cette heure de la nuit\e"
MFL0040003,"\h(«Belleza»)Je……
Je suis venue dire au revoir.\e"
MFL0040004,"\h(«Vyse»)Au revoir ?!
Vous ne vous battrez pas avec nous ?\e"
MFL0040005,"\h(«Belleza»)J'ai bien peur que non. Je ne peux pas me battre
contre mes propres hommes.\e"
MFL0040006,"\h(«Belleza»)Et puis……
Je dois m'occuper d'autre chose.\e"
MFL0040007,\h(«Vyse»)Autre chose ?\e
MFL0040008,\h(«Belleza»)……\e
MFL0040009,"\h(«Belleza»)……Ça me fait penser……
J'ai jeté un oeil dans la chambre d'Aika et de
Fina tout à l'heure.\e"
MFL0040010,\h(«Belleza»)Elles n'y étaient pas.\e
MFL0040011,\h(«Vyse»)Hein ? Vous parlez sérieusement ?\e
MFL0040012,"\h(«Belleza»)Elles ne pouvaient sûrement pas dormir…… Vous
savez…… la veille d'une bataille…… elles ne sont
pas aussi fortes qu'elles veulent le faire
croire……\e"
MFL0040013,"\h(«Belleza»)Un bon capitaine irait les trouver pour les
réconforter.\e"
MFL0040014,"\h(«Vyse»)Bon, d'accord.
Je vais aller les voir.\e"
MFL0040015,\h(«Belleza»)Hé hé…… Je m'en doutais.\e
MFL0040016,"\h(«Belleza»)Bon……
Je vais me mettre en route.\e"
MFL0040017,"\h(ｫBellezaｻ)Je sais que vous deviendrez un tr鑚 bon leader.
Et essayez de ne pas briser trop de c忖rs.
Au revoir, Vyse.\e"
MGL0040000,\h(«Vyse»)……Wer könnte das denn noch so spät sein?\e
MGL0040001,"\h( )Ich bin's, Vyse.\e"
MGL0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)Belleza?
Was machst du denn noch so spät……\e"
MGL0040003,"\h(«Belleza»)Ich……
Ich bin gekommen, mich zu verabschieden.\e"
MGL0040004,"\h(«Vyse»)Verabschieden?!
Du kämpfst nicht mit uns?\e"
MGL0040005,"\h(«Belleza»)Leider nicht.
Ihr könnt nicht von mir erwarten, dass ich
meine eigenen Leute bekämpfe.\e"
MGL0040006,"\h(«Belleza»)Und außerdem……
Da ist noch etwas anderes, das ich erledigen
muss.\e"
MGL0040007,\h(«Vyse»)Etwas anderes?\e
MGL0040008,\h(«Belleza»)…………\e
MGL0040009,"\h(«Belleza»)……Da fällt mir was ein.
Ich habe vorhin in Aika und Finas Zimmer
geschaut.\e"
MGL0040010,\h(«Belleza»)Keine von beiden war da.\e
MGL0040011,\h(«Vyse»)Wie? Ist das dein Ernst?\e
MGL0040012,"\h(«Belleza»)Wahrscheinlich konnten sie nicht schlafen……
weißt du…… die Nacht vor einer Schlacht……
sie sind nicht so stark, wie sie uns
weismachen wollen……\e"
MGL0040013,"\h(«Belleza»)Ein guter Kapitän würde sie suchen gehen und
sie trösten.\e"
MGL0040014,"\h(«Vyse»)Also gut.
Ich werde mich um sie kümmern.\e"
MGL0040015,\h(«Belleza»)Haha…… das hab ich mir gedacht.\e
MGL0040016,"\h(«Belleza»)Also, dann……
Ich muss jetzt gehen.\e"
MGL0040017,"\h(«Belleza»)Ich weiß, dass du dich zu einem großen
Anführer entwickeln wirst. Und versuche,
nicht zu viele Herzen zu brechen.
Mach's gut, Vyse.\e"
MSL0040000,\h(«Vyse»)…… ¿Quién será a estas horas de la noche?\e
MSL0040001,"\h( )Soy yo, Vyse.\e"
MSL0040002,"\h(«Vyse»)¿Belleza?
¿Qué haces levantada a estas horas……?\e"
MSL0040003,"\h(«Belleza»)Yo……
Vengo a decir adiós.\e"
MSL0040004,"\h(«Vyse»)¡¿Adiós?!
¿Es que no vas a luchar con nosotros?\e"
MSL0040005,"\h(«Belleza»)Me temo que no.
No puedes pedirme que luche contra mis propios
hombres.\e"
MSL0040006,"\h(«Belleza»)Además……
Hay otra cosa de la que tengo que ocuparme.\e"
MSL0040007,\h(«Vyse»)¿Otra cosa?\e
MSL0040008,\h(«Belleza»)……\e
MSL0040009,"\h(«Belleza»)……Eso me recuerda algo.
He ido a echar un vistazo a la habitación de
Aika y de Fina.\e"
MSL0040010,\h(«Belleza»)Ninguna de ellas estaba ahí.\e
MSL0040011,\h(«Vyse»)¿Eeh? ¿Lo dices en serio?\e
MSL0040012,"\h(«Belleza»)Seguro que no podían dormir…… Ya sabes…… la
noche antes de una batalla…… No son tan duras
como aparentan……\e"
MSL0040013,\h(«Belleza»)Un buen capitán iría a reconfortarlas.\e
MSL0040014,"\h(«Vyse»)Ya.
Iré a ver qué tal están.\e"
MSL0040015,\h(«Belleza»)Sí…… Suponía que lo harías.\e
MSL0040016,"\h(«Belleza»)Bueno……
Tengo que irme.\e"
MSL0040017,"\h(«Belleza»)Sé que acabarás siendo un gran líder.
Intenta no romper muchos corazones.
Adiós, Vyse.\e"
ML0050000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, Aika.\e"
ML0050001,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, hey Vyse.\e"
ML0050002,"\h(«Aika»)It looked like you were talking to Fina… 
How's she doing?\e"
ML0050003,\h(«Vyse»)She seemed a little worried about tomorrow… \e
ML0050004,"\h(«Aika»)Hm…
Fina, too, huh?\e"
ML0050005,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse?
What are you doing up this late?\e"
ML0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)Shouldn't I be asking you that question? 
What are you doing out here?\e"
ML0050007,"\h(«Aika»)Haha… Good point…
I should answer you first, I suppose…\e"
ML0050008,"\h(«Aika»)I don't know…
I crawled into bed, but I couldn't sleep.\e"
ML0050009,"\h(«Aika»)Maybe I'm just scared.
Heh… This isn't like me, I guess…\e"
ML0050010,"\h(«What will you say to Aika?»)“Hey, I'm scared, too.”
“Yeah, it isn't like you at all…”\e"
ML0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)Hey, don't worry about it. I'm scared, too.
Tomorrow is going to be our toughest battle, 
yet.\e"
ML0050012,"\h(«Aika»)Really?
I didn't think you ever got scared.\e"
ML0050013,"\h(«Vyse»)Just because I've been placed in charge of 
tomorrow's assault, doesn't mean that 
I'm not afraid of anything anymore… \e"
ML0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Haha… I'm sorry.
We've been through so much. I guess it's hard 
for me to remember you as the kid next door.\e"
ML0050015,"\h(«Aika»)That makes me feel a little better…
that I'm not the only one who's scared
around here… \e"
ML0050016,"\h(«Aika»)There's a lot riding on tomorrow's battle… 
I guess it's normal to be scared.\e"
ML0050017,"\h(«Vyse»)I feel the same way.
Hey, I'll bet Galcian is scared, too.\e"
ML0050018,"\h(«Aika»)Hahaha!
I bet he is!\e"
ML0050019,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah, it isn't like you at all. Maybe you should
hide under your bed.\e"
ML0050020,"\h(«Aika»)Hey! I said maybe! I didn't come right out and 
say it. And you don't have to make fun of me.\e"
ML0050021,"\h(«Vyse»)I didn't realize that you had a sensitive side, 
too. I think I like it, though.\e"
ML0050022,"\h(«Aika»)…Heh. The only reason why you didn't realize 
that is because every time I try to talk to you,
this is the kind of reaction that I get.\e"
ML0050023,"\h(«Aika»)I'm starting to feel better. Thanks, Vyse. 
You've always known how to cheer me up.\e"
ML0050024,"\h(«Aika»)Maybe I'm just feeling the pressure of 
tomorrow's battle. There's a lot riding on it.\e"
ML0050025,"\h(«Aika»)Maybe I should try to relax. We'll do our best 
and whatever happens, happens… \e"
ML0050026,"\h(«Vyse»)Yeah.
Just act like you always do, Aika, and 
everything will be fine.\e"
ML0050027,"\h(«Vyse»)All we have to do is fight like we always do… 
We've done pretty good so far!\e"
ML0050028,\h(«Aika»)Yeah… you're right.\e
ML0050029,"\h(«Aika»)I feel so much better now. Maybe I'll be able to
get some sleep.\e"
ML0050030,"\h(«Vyse»)Alright…
I'll see you tomorrow… \e"
ML0050031,\h(«Aika»)…Okay.\e
ML0050032,"\h(«Aika»)Thanks, Vyse.
We're gonna make history tomorrow!\e"
ML0050033,"\h(«Aika»)Good night!
You better not oversleep! Your dad's here… 
remember?\e"
MFL0050000,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé, Aika.\e"
MFL0050001,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, Vyse.\e"
MFL0050002,"\h(«Aika»)Tu parlais à Fina……
Comment va-t-elle ?\e"
MFL0050003,"\h(«Vyse»)Elle avait l'air un peu inquiète par rapport à
demain……\e"
MFL0050004,"\h(«Aika»)Hum……
Fina, aussi, hein ?\e"
MFL0050005,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse ?
Que fais-tu debout si tard ?\e"
MFL0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)C'est plutôt moi qui devrais te poser la
question ? Que fais-tu là ?\e"
MFL0050007,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… bien vu……
Je devrais répondre la première donc……\e"
MFL0050008,"\h(«Aika»)Je ne sais pas……
Je me suis mise au lit, mais je ne pouvais pas
dormir.\e"
MFL0050009,"\h(«Aika»)Peut-être que j'ai peur, tout simplement.
Hé…… Cela ne me ressemble pas, j'imagine……\e"
MFL0050010,"\h(«Que direz-vous à Aika ?»)“Hé, moi aussi, j'ai peur.”
“Oui, cela ne te ressemble pas du tout……”\e"
MFL0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)Hé, ne t'en fais pas. Moi aussi, j'ai peur.
La bataille de demain sera la plus dure que nous
ayons connue.\e"
MFL0050012,"\h(«Aika»)Vraiment ?
Je ne croyais pas que tu puisses avoir peur.\e"
MFL0050013,"\h(«Vyse»)Ce n'est pas parce que je mène l'attaque de
demain que je n'ai plus peur de rien……\e"
MFL0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… Je suis désolée.
Nous avons vécu tellement de choses. J'ai du mal
à me souvenir du gamin avec qui j'ai grandi.\e"
MFL0050015,"\h(«Aika»)Ça va un peu mieux……
de savoir que je ne suis pas la seule à avoir
peur……\e"
MFL0050016,"\h(«Aika»)L'avenir de ce monde se jouera dans la bataille
de demain…… C'est normal d'avoir peur.\e"
MFL0050017,"\h(«Vyse»)Je ressens la même chose.
Je parie que Galcian a peur aussi.\e"
MFL0050018,"\h(«Aika»)Hahaha !
Je parie que oui !\e"
MFL0050019,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui, cela ne te ressemble pas. Tu devrais
peut-être te cacher sous ton lit.\e"
MFL0050020,"\h(«Aika»)Hé ! J'ai dit peut-être ! Je n'ai pas vraiment
dit que j'avais peur. Et ce n'est pas la peine
de te moquer de moi.\e"
MFL0050021,"\h(«Vyse»)Je ne savais pas que tu étais aussi sensible.
Mais je crois que cela me plaît.\e"
MFL0050022,"\h(«Aika»)……Hé. Tu ne t'en es jamais rendu compte parce
que chaque fois que j'essaie de te parler,
tu réagis de cette façon.\e"
MFL0050023,"\h(«Aika»)Ça commence à aller mieux. Merci Vyse.
Tu as toujours su me remonter le moral.\e"
MFL0050024,"\h(«Aika»)Peut-être que c'est le stress de la bataille de
demain qui se fait sentir. L'avenir de ce monde
en dépend.\e"
MFL0050025,"\h(«Aika»)Je devrais peut-être essayer de me détendre.
Nous ferons de notre mieux, ce qui doit arriver,
arrivera……\e"
MFL0050026,"\h(«Vyse»)Oui.
Fais comme d'habitude, Aika, et tout ira bien.\e"
MFL0050027,"\h(«Vyse»)Nous n'avons qu'à nous battre comme d'habitude……
Nous nous en sommes bien sortis jusqu'à
présent !\e"
MFL0050028,\h(«Aika»)Oui…… tu as raison.\e
MFL0050029,"\h(«Aika»)Je me sens beaucoup mieux maintenant. Peut-être
que j'arriverai à dormir.\e"
MFL0050030,"\h(«Vyse»)D'accord……
À demain……\e"
MFL0050031,\h(«Aika»)……OK.\e
MFL0050032,"\h(«Aika»)Merci, Vyse.
Demain, nous entrons dans l'histoire !\e"
MFL0050033,"\h(«Aika»)Bonne nuit !
Réveille-toi à l'heure ! Ton père est là……
tu te souviens ?\e"
MGL0050000,"\h(«Vyse»)He, Aika.\e"
MGL0050001,"\h(«Aika»)Oh, hallo, Vyse.\e"
MGL0050002,"\h(«Aika»)Es sah so aus, als hättest du mit Fina
gesprochen…… wie geht es ihr?\e"
MGL0050003,\h(«Vyse»)Sie schien etwas besorgt wegen morgen……\e
MGL0050004,"\h(«Aika»)Hmm……
Sie also auch, wie?\e"
MGL0050005,"\h(«Aika»)Vyse?
Warum bist du zu so später Stunde noch wach?\e"
MGL0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)Das sollte ich dich fragen!
Was machst du hier draußen?\e"
MGL0050007,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… Gute Frage……
Ich nehme an, ich sollte zuerst antworten……\e"
MGL0050008,"\h(«Aika»)Ich weiß nicht……
Ich bin ins Bett gekrochen, aber ich konnte
nicht schlafen.\e"
MGL0050009,"\h(«Aika»)Vielleicht habe ich bloß Angst.
He…… Schätze, es sieht mir nicht ähnlich……\e"
MGL0050010,"\h(«Was wirst du Aika sagen?»)“He, ich hab auch Angst”.
“Ja, das sieht dir gar nicht ähnlich……”\e"
MGL0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)He, mach dir keine Sorgen. Ich habe auch Angst.
Morgen steht uns die schwerste Schlacht bevor,
die wir je hatten.\e"
MGL0050012,"\h(«Aika»)Ach ja?
Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass du es je mit der
Angst bekommst.\e"
MGL0050013,"\h(«Vyse»)Nur weil man mich zum Anführer des morgigen
Angriffs gemacht hat, bedeutet noch lange nicht,
dass ich mich vor nichts mehr fürchte……\e"
MGL0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Haha…… tut mir Leid.
Wir haben so viel durchgemacht. Schätze, es
fällt mir schwer, dich noch als meinen kleinen
Spielkameraden zu sehen.\e"
MGL0050015,"\h(«Aika»)Jetzt fühle ich mich schon besser……
weil ich hier nicht die Einzige bin, die
Angst hat……\e"
MGL0050016,"\h(«Aika»)Von der morgigen Schlacht hängt sehr viel ab……
Ich denke, da ist es normal, Angst zu haben.\e"
MGL0050017,"\h(«Vyse»)Du sagst es.
He, ich möchte wetten, Galcian hat auch Angst.\e"
MGL0050018,"\h(«Aika»)Hahaha!
Mit Sicherheit!\e"
MGL0050019,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja, das sieht dir gar nicht ähnlich. Vielleicht
solltest du dich unterm Bett
verstecken.\e"
MGL0050020,"\h(«Aika»)He! Ich habe vielleicht gesagt! So war das auch
wieder nicht gemeint. Und du sollst dich nicht
lustig über mich machen.\e"
MGL0050021,"\h(«Vyse»)Ich wusste gar nicht, dass du auch so sensibel
sein kannst. Aber es gefällt mir.\e"
MGL0050022,"\h(«Aika»)……He, der einzige Grund, weshalb du das bisher
nicht gemerkt hast, ist, dass du jedes Mal so
reagierst, wenn ich versuche, mit dir zu reden.\e"
MGL0050023,"\h(«Aika»)Ich fühle mich schon etwas besser. Danke, Vyse.
du hast schon immer gewusst, wie du mich
aufmuntern kannst.\e"
MGL0050024,"\h(«Aika»)Vielleicht ist das der Druck der morgigen
Schlacht. Es hängt viel davon ab.\e"
MGL0050025,"\h(«Aika»)Vielleicht sollte ich mich ein wenig entspannen.
Wir werden unser Bestes tun, und was auch
immer passiert, das passiert……\e"
MGL0050026,"\h(«Vyse»)Ja.
Sei einfach so, wie du immer bist, Aika, und
alles wird gut.\e"
MGL0050027,"\h(«Vyse»)Wir müssen einfach so kämpfen, wie wir es
immer tun…… Bisher waren wir doch gar nicht so
schlecht!\e"
MGL0050028,\h(«Aika»)Ja…… du hast Recht.\e
MGL0050029,"\h(«Aika»)Ich fühle mich jetzt schon viel besser.
Vielleicht kann ich jetzt etwas schlafen.\e"
MGL0050030,"\h(«Vyse»)In Ordnung……
Dann bis morgen……\e"
MGL0050031,\h(«Aika»)……Okay.\e
MGL0050032,"\h(«Aika»)Danke, Vyse.
Morgen werden wir in die Geschichte eingehen!\e"
MGL0050033,"\h(«Aika»)Gute Nacht!
Du solltest aber nicht verschlafen! Du weißt
ja, dein Dad ist mit dabei……\e"
MSL0050000,"\h(«Vyse»)Eh, Aika.\e"
MSL0050001,"\h(«Aika»)Ah…… Hola, Vyse.\e"
MSL0050002,"\h(«Aika»)Me pareció que hablabas con Fina……
¿Qué tal está?\e"
MSL0050003,\h(«Vyse»)Parecía un poco preocupada por lo de mañana……\e
MSL0050004,"\h(«Aika»)Mm……
Fina también, ¿eh?\e"
MSL0050005,"\h(«Aika»)¿Vyse?
¿Qué haces levantado a estas horas?\e"
MSL0050006,"\h(«Vyse»)¿No te puedo hacer yo la misma pregunta?
¿Y qué haces tú aquí?\e"
MSL0050007,"\h(«Aika»)Ja, ja…… Es verdad……
Supongo que me toca contestar a mí primero……\e"
MSL0050008,"\h(«Aika»)No lo sé……
Me metí en la cama, pero no podía dormirme.\e"
MSL0050009,"\h(«Aika»)A lo mejor es que tengo miedo.
Eh…… Sabes que yo no soy así……\e"
MSL0050010,"\h(«¿Qué vas a decirle a Aika?»)“Tranquila, yo también tengo miedo.”
“Sí, la verdad es que no pareces la de siempre.”\e"
MSL0050011,"\h(«Vyse»)No te preocupes. Yo también estoy asustado.
Mañana va a librarse la batalla más dura.\e"
MSL0050012,"\h(«Aika»)¿En serio?
Creía que tú nunca te asustas.\e"
MSL0050013,"\h(«Vyse»)Sólo porque voy a dirigir la ofensiva de mañana,
no significa que ya no hay nada que me dé miedo
en el mundo……\e"
MSL0050014,"\h(«Aika»)Ja, ja, ja…… Perdona.
Hemos vivido tantas cosas juntos. A veces es
difícil acordarse del chico que eras antes.\e"
MSL0050015,"\h(«Aika»)Me siento mejor……
Sabiendo que no soy la única que tiene miedo……\e"
MSL0050016,"\h(«Aika»)Tantas cosas dependen de la batalla de mañana……
Supongo que es normal tener miedo.\e"
MSL0050017,"\h(«Vyse»)Eso pienso yo.
Eh, qué te apuestas a que Galcian también tiene
miedo.\e"
MSL0050018,"\h(«Aika»)¡Ja, ja, ja!
¡Me apuesto lo que sea!\e"
MSL0050019,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí, la verdad es que no pareces la de siempre.
Por qué no vas a esconderte bajo la cama.\e"
MSL0050020,"\h(«Aika»)¡Eh! ¡Dije que a lo mejor! Lo he dicho con la
boca pequeña y no tienes por qué reírte de mí.\e"
MSL0050021,"\h(«Vyse»)No me había dado cuenta de que también tienes un
lado sensible. Pero me gusta.\e"
MSL0050022,"\h(«Aika»)……La única razón por la que no te habías dado
cuenta es porque cada vez que intento hablar
contigo, me tropiezo con la misma reacción.\e"
MSL0050023,"\h(«Aika»)Estoy mucho mejor que antes. Gracias, Vyse.
Siempre te las arreglas para subirme la moral.\e"
MSL0050024,"\h(«Aika»)A lo mejor es que estoy un poco tensa por la
batalla de mañana. Nos jugamos mucho en esa
batalla.\e"
MSL0050025,"\h(«Aika»)Debería intentar relajarme. Lo haremos lo mejor
que podamos y lo que haya de pasar, pasará……\e"
MSL0050026,"\h(«Vyse»)Sí.
Tú sólo actúa como siempre, Aika, y todo irá
bien.\e"
